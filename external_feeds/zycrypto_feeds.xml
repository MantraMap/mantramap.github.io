<p>One of the four biggest banks in Australia, the National Australia Bank (NAB), has announced that it will soon roll out a new Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum and Algorand. By doing so, NAB has become the second of the country’s major financial institutions to build a stablecoin.</p>



<h2 id="h-second-major-australian-bank-launches-stablecoin-project"><strong>Second Major Australian Bank Launches Stablecoin Project</strong></h2>



<p>The National Australia Bank is soon launching a stablecoin to enable customers to settle transactions on the blockchain in real-time using Australian dollars. It will also be used to purchase carbon credits and in overseas money transfers and repurchase agreements.</p>



<p>The stablecoin, dubbed AUDN, will debut on the Ethereum and Algorand blockchains in the middle of this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Howard Silby, NAB’s chief innovation officer, told the <em>Australian Financial Review </em>(<em>AFR</em>) that the decision to create the stablecoin, which is backed 1:1 by the Australian dollar, was based on the financial institution’s opinion that blockchain technology will play a major role in the next evolution of finance.</p>



<p>“We certainly believe there are elements of blockchain technology that will form part of the future of finance [&#8230;] From our point of view, we see [blockchain] has the potential to deliver instantaneous, transparent, inclusive, financial outcomes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>NAB will be the second of Australia’s big four banks to mint a stablecoin, after rival Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) built its own Australian dollar-pegged stablecoin, A$DC, in March.</p>



<p>The two banks initially planned to cooperate on a single nationwide stablecoin with the other two Big Four Australian banks, but the project never commenced because of competition concerns and the different stages each bank was at in its crypto strategy.</p>



<h2><strong>Australia Beefs Up Crypto Credentials</strong></h2>



<p>Australia has<a href="https://zycrypto.com/australia-accelerates-crypto-adoption-plans-ahead-of-2023/"> stepped up </a>its crypto oversight efforts in recent months, with the country planning to modernize its financial system and begin a review of how cryptocurrency assets are managed, with a view toward keeping practices up to date and safeguarding consumers.</p>



<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/21/asic-bolsters-its-cryptocurrency-team-and-looks-to-regulate-more-digital-assets">expanded </a>its crypto team in March 2022, following Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) security model and an array of collapses in the fast-growing industry.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Australia’s central bank expects to complete a pilot for its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) by mid-2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Optimistically speaking, Ripple chief <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-tells-where-crypto-market-is-headed-as-xrp-lawsuit-heads-for-conclusion/">Brad Garlinghouse</a> thinks the long-drawn-out battle between his company and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing its conclusion. Garlinghouse is hopeful about a successful resolution to the case within “single-digit months”.</p>



<h2 id="h-ripple-ceo-blasts-sec-s-embarrassing-behavior"><strong>Ripple CEO Blasts SEC’s “Embarrassing” Behavior</strong></h2>



<p>On January 18, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told <em>CNBC </em>at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, that a final decision about whether Ripple, the crypto company affiliated with the XRP cryptocurrency, violated federal securities laws could come as early as June. This is because both parties in the case have now filed and fully briefed their arguments before the presiding judge.</p>



<p>The action by the SEC was initially <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">filed </a>in December 2020 and accused the firm of conducting a $1.3 billion unlicensed securities sale with its XRP coin. It has been a lengthy fight, and Garlinghouse said he expects a court decision this year. “We expect a decision from a judge certainly in 2023. You don’t really have control over when a judge makes their decisions. But I’m optimistic that sometime in the coming single-digit months we’ll have closure there,” the Ripple boss opined.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse as well as most crypto pundits believe the judge will ultimately rule in Ripple’s favour relative to the law and the facts. Nonetheless, he did not pass up the chance to take a dig at the U.S. securities regulator. The Ripple chief observed that the SEC had displayed some pretty “embarrassing” behaviour throughout the course of the suit. “Just some of the things that have been happening, like you’ve got to be kidding,” he added.</p>



<h2><strong>Garlinghouse Sees Very Slim Chance Of Settlement</strong></h2>



<p>Brad Garlinghouse further noted that Ripple had met with the SEC on several occasions in its push for regulatory clarity, and the commission did not tell him they thought XRP was a security. However, the SEC betrayed Ripple when it lodged the scorching complaint.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse then urged the SEC to emulate some of the crypto-friendly jurisdictions such as the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, and the U.K., which have developed forward-looking cryptocurrency regulations that encourage innovation.</p>



<p>Regarding the possibility of reaching a settlement, Garlinghouse indicated Ripple would only <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-good-chance-sec-will-settle-with-ripple-to-avoid-exposing-hinman-documents-says-legal-expert/">agree to settle</a> if the U.S. agency clarified that XRP did not qualify as a security.</p>



<p>Yet, “the SEC and Gary Gensler have very outwardly said he views almost all crypto as a security,” Garlinghouse posited, “and so that leaves very little space in the Venn diagram for settlement.”</p>

<p>A 2022 <a href="https://crypto.com/research/2022-crypto-market-sizing-report">Crypto.com market sizing report </a>has revealed that 119 million new crypto owners were added in the period between January 2022 to January 2023. The figure represents a 39% increase, bringing the total number of global owners to 425 million.</p>



<p>The findings correspond with a 2022 Triple-A report that pegged global users at 320 million and predicted a rise beyond those figures before 2023. Triple A ranked the USA, Pakistan, India, Nigeria and Vietnam as the top 5 countries where crypto owners live.</p>



<p>On a further breakdown of the report, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-manipulation-former-sec-official-reveals-factors-propelling-bitcoins-latest-price-ascent/">Bitcoin</a> owners gained an impressive amount of new users representing a 26% increase, with Ethereum surging to 87 million users, representing a 263% increase over the last 12 months. The top two cryptocurrencies, with a combined market cap of over $587 billion, continued to hold up to 70% dominance of the total crypto market.</p>



<p>Findings point to the merge as the major propeller or Ethereum surge, as the transition from proof-of-work to energy-efficient proof-of-stake attracted many new users to the network. Other factors like staking and investments from investors pulled traffic in its direction as well.</p>



<p>Throughout its transition mid-last year, a section of the crypto community grew worried about a potential susceptibility to institutional censorship and control—two issues antithetical to the goal of crypto. Still, such fears have been eclipsed by a trove of exchange failures and other external factors costing the ecosystem over $2 trillion in losses. Ethereum, currently valued at $1,500, had just marked a long-awaited sharp rise since falling from its all-time high of $3,521 in March 2022 to a little over $900 in June.</p>



<p>Over the last three years, Bitcoin has continued to crawl back a significant portion of its dominance in the crypto market. The crypto market leader fell hard on its back in 2022, losing nearly three-quarters of its ATH value and a little over trillions of dollars in market capitalization over the last 15 months. To bring more clarity, a market capitalization dominance which stood at 65% in 2021 for the satoshi-based crypto, shrunk to a whopping 43% by mid-July 2021. With the current reports, however, hopes are high for the apex crypto to return to its winning streak as it stands at a 41% market cap dominance.</p>



<p>Bitcoin continues to chart an impressive price run beyond &#8211; and around $20,000 over the past two weeks.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Jan 15 the team behind Shibarium published a blog, giving the community a first look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-renews-bullish-momentum-for-0-001-shib-as-massive-token-burn-expected/">Shibarium protocol</a>. As per the blog, developers behind the much-anticipated protocol were “approaching the finishing touches for Shibarium&#8217;s Beta and its imminent launch.”</p>



<p>Addressing the incessant question of “wen” the launch will happen, the team, however, asked the SHIB army to be patient, stating that the phased release was not a matter of when but a matter of developing Shibarium correctly and introducing it responsibly.</p>



<p><em>“Avoid asking wen, because the answer will always be a &#8216;soon&#8217;,”</em> they said.</p>



<p>In a tweet earlier, anonymous Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama likened Shibarium to a pine tree which would revamp the Shiba Inu ecosystem and give developers and the Shib community a wide range of functionalities.</p>



<p><em>“The tree of life may have a thousand leaves, but all these leaves are the same tree.”</em> Wrote Kusama.</p>



<p><em>“During fall the tree may have only a few leaves, but then spring appears. Luckily, Shibarium, in this context, is a Pine Tree. Still, it needs water, sunlight and proper soil. But pines survive and thrive during the harshest winters.”</em></p>



<p>Shibarium was first proposed in May 2022 by&nbsp;Ryoshi, the anonymous creator of&nbsp;the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token&nbsp;in May 2021 after launching SHIB in 2020 and establishing a huge and loyal community in the form of ShibArmy.</p>



<p>Shibarium’s goal has been to transform and improve the investor experience in the Shiba ecosystem by providing increased transaction speeds, lowering costs, allowing projects to scale and introducing bridges for other blockchains. In short, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-finally-wants-to-drop-the-memecoin-tag-with-the-debut-of-its-own-blockchain-as-adoption-rate-wobbles/">Shibarium will propel</a> the Shiba Inu ecosystem towards achieving its full potential, which has been hampered by Ethereum’s&nbsp;low scalability and high gas fees.</p>



<p>Notably, Shibarium will also introduce new SHIB burning mechanisms to help reduce the token’s high supply. As previously reported, BONE&nbsp; will act as the native token selected to pay for gas transactions and reward validators within the Shibarium protocol. Furthermore, for every transaction conducted using BONE, SHIB tokens <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-renews-bullish-momentum-for-0-001-shib-as-massive-token-burn-expected/">will be destroyed</a>, effectively reducing the circulating supply of the token over time.</p>



<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;although the market has reacted favourably to Sunday’s announcement, the upcoming launch has stoked investors who believe that Shibarium will revolutionize the ecosystem in the greatest way possible. Some also see Shibarium as a price-pumping tool that could propel SHIB’s price to even $$0.001. The so-called “DOGE killer” grew by over 30% in the past week, effectively tapping a fresh high. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.0000112 after growing by 5.81% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<li>The fiat deposit option for Coinbase’s clients in Japan will not be available from Jan.20.</li>
</ul>



<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced Wednesday that it would discontinue its operations in Japan days after cutting staff. All users from the region have until February 16, 2023, JST, to redeem their cryptocurrencies from the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;Due to market conditions, our company has made the difficult decision to halt operations in Japan and to conduct a complete review of our business in the country. However, we are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for our valued customers,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/halting-operations-in-japan?__cf_chl_f_tk=iBXaA1Aqy.Mn_X2vcNHVKpiaGntsOHQtw8LPichl4eo-1674022317-0-gaNycGzNBz0">blog post</a>.</p>



<p>Further, the fiat deposit option will be closed from January 20 JST, according to the announcement, which added that it had separated the Japanese Yen and crypto assets on the platform per the set regulations to allow customers to withdraw their funds.</p>



<p>The withdrawal option provided by the exchange can be – to any other virtual asset service provider, Coinbase wallet, or self-custody wallet. Customers could also opt to convert their portfolio into fiat and redeem it from any local bank. Failure to which the pending holdings would be changed to fiat and remitted to the Guaranty Account at the Legal Affairs Bureau, where customers can redeem themselves.</p>



<h2 id="h-kraken-closed-operations-in-japan-last-month-but-binance-thinks-otherwise"><strong>Kraken Closed Operations in Japan Last Month, but Binance Thinks Otherwise</strong></h2>



<p>Kraken, another major US crypto exchange, announced its exit from Japan on December 28, also citing tough market conditions and a weak global environment for digital assets. The exchange’s clients have until January 31 to withdraw their holdings or convert them to JPY and send them to a domestic bank account.</p>



<p>On the contrary, industry-leading exchange Binance is doubling down on its operations in the East Asian country. Last month, the platform <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-re-enters-japanese-crypto-market-with-acquisition-of-fsa-regulated-exchange-sakura/">announced</a> an acquisition of Sakura Exchange BitCoin, a digital assets firm regulated by the FSA, offering 11 major crypto pairs, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>Since the collapse of Mt. Gox about eight years ago, Japan has been keen to regulate the sector without stifling innovation, something that has caused Binance to be at loggerheads with its regulatory agency, FSA. In 2018, the exchange had to abandon plans to set up a base in Tokyo on regulatory grounds.</p>

<p>More than two years have passed since the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued</a> San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm Ripple, throwing many XRP holders into chaos.</p>



<p>But could a breakthrough for Ripple finally be on the horizon?</p>



<p>U.S. Attorney John Deaton has shared more reasons why he thinks the SEC faces a bruising defeat against Ripple.</p>



<h2 id="h-sec-accusations-are-stretched-too-far"><strong>SEC Accusations Are Stretched Too Far</strong></h2>



<p>CryptoLaw founder John Deaton has criticized observers predicting that the SEC will secure victory against Ripple and that the XRP cryptocurrency is doomed. He explained that they are “overstating” the SEC’s chances as the agency’s claims are overstretched.</p>



<p>Deaton cited SEC’s argument about Ripple, alluding that it is a common enterprise. A common enterprise is when the profits of the investor are dependent on the success of third parties or those selling the investment.</p>



<p>Over the course of the courtroom drama, the SEC has been forced by Ripple to admit that holding XRP tokens does not give the investor any rights in the payments company. Moreover, Ripple does not owe XRP holders anything. This indicates that XRP fails the Howey Test as it does not meet the criteria for being considered a security.</p>



<p>The founders of the blockchain payments company Ripple Labs created XRP. Ripple was designed to help banks and other financial institutions move money in real-time and at low costs.</p>



<p>The SEC filed a suit against Ripple in December 2020 on allegations that it raised billions through XRP sales since 2013 and failed to register the offerings as securities as required by U.S. law. At the heart of the matter is whether the regulator can prove the XRP token is in fact a security.</p>



<p>Deaton pointed out that XRP holders submitted at least 3,000 affidavits a year and a half before anyone else petitioned for amicus curiae status. The motions revealed that the bulk of early investors had never heard of Ripple, the company, and they purchased XRP for non-investment reasons. They also received financial benefits independently of Ripple.</p>



<h2><strong>Hope Swells For Ripple Victory</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s high-profile battle with the SEC has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-coinbase-asks-court-for-permission-to-support-ripple/">attracted support</a> from heavyweights in the financial industry — including America’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase and crypto lobbyist group Blockchain Association. Ripple claims it has already spent approximately $100 million in litigation and, effectively, to safeguard the entire crypto sector from what it calls overreach by the federal agency.</p>



<p>Two years later, the SEC faces a painful reckoning as Ripple bags countless procedural victories. Most believe the blockchain payments company will win the scorched-earth case and subsequently discredit the 1946 Howey Test.</p>



<p>Prevailing in the case could prove to be a boon for the XRP price, which has been in the doldrums. With a market cap of $19.7 billion, according to CoinGecko data, XRP is currently the sixth most valuable crypto asset.</p>

<p>The much-awaited hard fork aimed at boosting <a href="https://zycrypto.com/can-matic-sustain-current-upsurge-as-polygon-tests-zero-knowledge-rollups/">Polygon’s performance</a> went live today at block 38,189,056, brewing a wave of optimism among the MATIC community.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the team behind the Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol confirmed that the hard fork would proceed as scheduled, noting that no action will be required from MATIC holders as it will be triggered automatically.</p>



<p>The upgrade, dubbed the “Polygon Delhi Fork”, seeks to achieve two key objectives; reducing gas spikes during transactions and improving transaction finality by reducing chain reorganization (reorgs).</p>



<p>In a blog last week, the polygon team noted that the upgrade would change the base fee from 8 to 16. The&nbsp;base fee is the minimum gas needed for a transaction to be included in a new block. Although gas prices normally work most of the time, when the chain experiences high demand, the base gas fees may experience exponential spikes.</p>



<p>According to the team, “<em>the expectation is that the rate of change for the base gas fee will fall to 6.25% from the current 12.5% to smooth severe fluctuations in gas prices.”</em></p>



<p>And although gas will still increase during peak demand, it will be more in line with the way Ethereum gas dynamics work now, the team noted, adding, <em>“The goal is smooth out spikes and ensure a more seamless experience when interacting with the chain.”</em></p>



<p>Concerning the upgrade&#8217;s second objective, the team noted that addressing chain reorgs will reduce the sprint lengths from 64 to 16 blocks. As a result, a single block producer will be able to produce blocks continuously for a much shorter time (about 35 seconds), far less than the current time (about 128 seconds).</p>



<p>Polygon was first launched in 2017 to offer the much-needed scaling solution for Ethereum. Since then, users and developers have enjoyed faster throughput and lower fees, with more than 2.3 billion transactions being processed. Over 203 million unique addresses have signed up on Polygon with thousands of decentralized apps (DApps), including some of the biggest Web3 projects like UniSwap and Aave building atop it. Thus, the upcoming upgrade is one of the more <a href="https://zycrypto.com/can-matic-sustain-current-upsurge-as-polygon-tests-zero-knowledge-rollups/">immediate steps</a> in improving the chain&#8217;s performance and predictability.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while MATIC, the native token for Polygon, is yet to make any colossal moves following the upgrade, the crypto asset is expected to continue with its ascent towards $2 after surging over 20% in the past seven days. At press time, the crypto asset was trading at $1.02, up 0.74% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<li>The lender is also facing pressure in Bulgaria for alleged money laundering and tax offences.</li>



<li>Last month, Nexo was forced to exit the US over ‘unclear regulations.’</li>
</ul>



<p>Nexo is suing Cayman Islands’ financial regulator for denying its registration as a virtual asset service provider in the territory. The Cayman Islands Monetary Authority declined Nexo’s VASP application dated December 20.</p>



<p>Among the reasons cited by the authority is a need for more documentation on customer and enterprise risk assessment. CIMA is also faulting the application, among other things, for not having enough anti-money laundering provisions.</p>



<p>Countering the claims, Nexo noted in the lawsuit that the reasons pointed out by CIMA are not ‘‘satisfactory nor sufficiently detailed.’’ For that reason, it is seeking that the directive is reversed and awarded the operating license.</p>



<p>‘‘<em>The case is a natural reflection of Nexo’s ongoing license acquisition mission worldwide and something quite normal that occasionally happens throughout the process of getting authorized,</em>’’ says the firm’s spokesperson on Telegram.</p>



<h2 id="h-bulgaria-investigates-nexo-for-money-laundering-offenses"><strong>Bulgaria Investigates Nexo for Money Laundering Offenses</strong></h2>



<p>The conflict is one of many challenges facing Nexo &#8211; which claims on its official website to support more than 5 million users across 200 jurisdictions. In Bulgaria, the lender is under probe for alleged money laundering and tax-related offenses. Particularly, the Bulgarian political party GERB is accusing the country’s ruling party ‘We Continue the Change’ and Democratic Bulgaria of receiving donations from Nexo.</p>



<p>According to coverage by a local media house, former Prime Minister Boiko Borisov, and a member of GERB, alleged that five personnel linked to Nexo sent 20,000 BGN as a donation to Democratic Bulgaria.&nbsp; The party members also claim that a similar amount was donated by individuals linked to Nexo.</p>



<p>Miles away, Nexo was recently forced to leave the US market over what it claimed to be ‘unclear regulations,’ per a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-lender-nexo-to-exit-us-market-over-unclear-regulations/">report</a> by ZyCrypto. The company further had to stop its Earn Interest product in several states following a cease and desist order by the SEC for &#8211; offering and selling securities without prior qualification.</p>



<p>An accompanying statement by Nexo’s co-founder, Antoni Trenchev, noted that the lender was solvent, refuting earlier claims to the contrary. ‘‘<em>Insolvency, bankruptcy, is nowhere in Nexo’s reality, and we believe, we hope, we inspire while working hard to deliver a strong and sustainable future to the users.</em>’’</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s recent price performance has turned many heads in the cryptocurrency market this year. The asset’s bullish price movement has elicited notable reactions from John Reed Stark, the former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s Office of Internet Enforcement.</p>



<p>Like many other key figures, Reed has taken to Twitter to disclose what he believes is a main factor behind the recent upsurge in Bitcoin’s price.</p>



<p><em>“Bitcoin’s price is rising for one reason: Market Manipulation. A recent Forbes analysis of 157 crypto exchanges found that 51% of daily bitcoin trading volume being reported was likely bogus (and that was the tip of the iceberg).” Reed asserted in a recent tweet.</em></p>



<p>His tweets echo the sentiments of David Gerard, a journalist and author, who, in previous times, have postulated bearish viewpoints on digital currencies and blockchains.</p>



<p>Gerard explains that the reason for Bitcoin’s rise to $20,000 is not tied to any “macroeconomic actions, regulatory announcements or the strength of the dollar.”</p>



<p>He maintains that market manipulation is at play, pointing to the recent news of Gemini and Genesis being sued by the SEC, as some of the bearish events that lead him to believe that price pumps are usually “bad news for major players.”</p>



<h2 id="h-bitcoin-taps-21-000-where-s-the-big-bull-headed-next"><strong>Bitcoin taps $21,000; where’s the big bull headed next? </strong></h2>



<p>It bears mentioning that a lot of key figures are rather <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-planb-on-how-current-btc-hodlers-will-lay-the-foundation-for-the-next-bitcoin-bull-run/">bullish on Bitcoin</a> and the majority of cryptocurrencies than they are bearish.  </p>



<p>Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong is one of the notable figures predicting that Bitcoin is heading towards $25,000 or $30,000 in the next 45 days, although he believes the asset might hover between $20,000 to $25,000 for most of 2023.</p>



<p>Similarly, PlanB, the creator of the Bitcoin S2F model, is also eyeing Bitcoin at $32,000 in 2024. He expects that price to triple and reach $100,000 during the bull run in 2025.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, at press time, Bitcoin is valued at a price of  $21,212. The asset managed to sustain gains of over 20% throughout the last week.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77241" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-5-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, traders seem convinced that the crypto market is nearing the top. As Santiment, the leading market intelligence platform explained in a recent tweet;</p>



<p><em>“Are crypto markets seeing a top? Traders are behaving like they believe so, taking this opportunity to profit while given the chance. Bitcoin  is seeing its highest profit tx ratio since Feb, 2021. For Ethereum, it&#8217;s the highest since Oct, 2021.”</em></p>

<p>Among the cryptocurrencies posting impressive gains is Polygon’s MATIC which has added 11% in the past day at $1.03, coinciding with the network’s test of its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-scalability-upgrade-zkevm-announces-final-testnet-here-is-what-you-need-to-know/">zero-knowledge</a> (zk-Rollups) technology before the full deployment. On the weekly CoinMarketCap chart, MATIC has climbed 22%.</p>



<p>Speaking about the technology, the project lead of Polygon zkEVM and PolygonID, David Schwartz, confirmed that the zk-rollups are compatible with Ethereum after creating 12,000 zk-proofs for the testnet. The aim of zkEVM, according to the developer, is to increase the speed at which the layer-2 Ethereum scaling platform can achieve finality without compromising the validity and security of transactions.</p>



<p>Described as the most significant milestone in scalability, zkEVM mostly targets the scaling of the Ethereum blockchain, different from other scaling solutions &#8211; zk-SNARK and zk-STARK by StarkNet’s &#8211; that guarantee scalability by grouping multiple transactions into one proof to confirm validity on-chain.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-zk-rollup-technology-works"><strong>How ZK Rollup Technology Works</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon’s ZK roll-up is a scaling solution that bundles several off-chain transactions into one on-chain transaction, eliminating the need for individual transactions to be validated on the Ethereum Mainnet by generating validity proofs for each roll-up. The Ethereum-scaling network is reportedly planning to invest more than $1 billion in zero-knowledge technology, where currently, at least four of its products are based, including Zero, Miden, Hermez, and Nightfall.</p>



<p>Polygon zero is one of the solutions in zkEVM that focuses mainly on scalability by reducing the computational cost of coming up with validity proofs, or zero-knowledge proofs, enabling instant confirmation of roll-up transactions on the mainnet. Users can transfer funds smoothly between the roll-up and Ethereum without delays.</p>



<p>Polygon’s latest development happens amid a bullish sentiment that has started the year off well for cryptocurrencies. The MATIC surge remains to be seen if it would be sustainable; however, the overall factors affecting cryptos would inform the next step. But considering the double-digit explosion of the token, investors could be readying to take profits, capping further gains before the next leg up.</p>

<p>The co-founders of the defunct three arrows capital hedge fund (3AC), Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, have announced plans to launch a new crypto exchange named GTX. According to Zhu, GTX will function as a claim-based crypto exchange where victims of bankrupt crypto projects can trade their claims for ready equity.</p>



<p>In a pitch deck released to the public on Monday, Zhu and Davies are in search of $25 million in funding to get GTX running “asap’ this February.</p>



<p>With over $15 Billion in liquidation claims due for settlement over the last five years, Zhu believes crypto needs a claim management project to improve its ecosystem. Many creditors of the defunct Mt. Gox are still yet to receive their claims after the exchange officially filed for Bankruptcy nine years ago.</p>



<p>Eight years after Mt. Gox, one of the most brutal bear runs equally capitulated more of crypto’s finest foot soldiers like Celsius, Voyager, Terraform Labs, BlockFi and FTX, leaving a litany of crypto holders in limbo about their finances.</p>



<p>Overwhelmingly negative reactions, however, trailed the news of Zhu and Davies’ GTX, as it represents an effortless mockery of the defunct FTX. Zhu, whose exact whereabouts are unknown to date, confirmed the company name as a make-shift swipe at Bankman-Fried’s FTX, adding that a new name will be chosen in the coming weeks. Zhu may be looking to get back at SBF, whom he tweeted against last November, on the heel of the FTX saga, by luring embittered FTX’s creditors to become GTX’s first customers.</p>



<p>But the scars of 3AC are far from erased. Over $200 million was lost on its position with TerraUSD. The two college colleagues turned co-founders who fantasized about having the biggest yacht in Asia were forced to declare bankruptcy in the same month their super-deluxe RMF, aka “Much Wow” yacht, would launch. With both founders on the watchlist of the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and facing a subpoena from Teneo, 3AC’s liquidating company, the news of its new GTX exchange is seen by many as a subtle effort to raise capital and exit their burdening bankruptcy obligations.</p>



<p>The idea of a claims management project in crypto is great, but the questionable character of two of its co-founders casts a shadow on the unspeakable motive behind its creation.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Binance and Huobi announced that they had thwarted a money laundering scheme involving funds stolen from Harmony Horizon Bridge last year.</p>



<p>According to Changpeng Zhao “CZ”, Binance assisted Huobi in netting the hacker who had earlier tried to launder the stolen crypto assets through Binance.</p>



<p>“<em>We detected Harmony One hacker fund movement. They previously tried to launder through Binance and we froze his accounts. This time he used Huobi. We assisted Huobi team to freeze his accounts,” </em>tweeted CZ.</p>



<p>According to the Binance founder, they recovered 124 BTC valued at approximately $2.5 million at press time. Huobi’s advisor Justin Sun later confirmed the news thanking the exchanges’ dedicated team for detecting and preventing the funds from being laundered. </p>



<p><em>“This is a prime example of how centralized exchanges (CeFi) can work together to keep the crypto community SAFU. We will continue to be vigilant in our efforts to protect our users&#8217; funds and promote a safe and secure trading environment,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>The announcement comes after on-chain crypto sleuth ZachXBT <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1614902410350301184">highlighted</a> that North Korea’s Lazarus Group had sent 41,000 ETH worth about $64M over the weekend and $63.5m to three exchange addresses. Confirming that the ETH was from the Harmony Horizon Bridge hack, the detective noted that the assets had originated from anonymizing service Tornado Cash to Railgun before being deposited to the exchanges.</p>



<p>“<em>Seems Binance and Huobi froze a portion of the funds,”</em> ZachXBT later wrote after CZ’s announcement.</p>



<p>This has been the largest seizure by the exchanges since the Harmony Horizon Bridge <a href="https://zycrypto.com/harmonys-one-token-nosedives-double-digits-after-hacker-drained-100m-from-horizon-bridge/">reported</a> that hackers had exploited a vulnerability to steal $100 million on June 24, 2022. Launched in October 2020, Harmony Horizon Bridge was one of the first cross-bridge protocols and helped users to send assets from one chain to the other. Some analysts believe that the hackers could have targeted login credentials belonging to employees of the firm before deploying programs to initiate the heist.</p>



<p>Several blockchain analysis providers linked the theft to the Lazarus Group, which is believed to be funding North Korea’s ballistic weapons program. The group has also been to the theft of over $2 billion, including a $620 million heist on the Ronin Network, a sidechain built for the popular Web3 game Axie Infinity last March.</p>

<p>Austin Federa, head of strategy and communications at the Solana Foundation, has hinted at major development for the Solana network in 2023, igniting a major spike in SOL’s price after more than three months in the doldrums.</p>



<p>Speaking to Bloomberg Friday, he noted that the foundation would focus on reinvesting in the fundamentals to create opportunities for builders in 2023, adding that the community was already angling towards that direction.</p>



<h2 id="h-moving-past-ftx-relationship"><strong>Moving Past FTX Relationship</strong></h2>



<p>The last half of 2022 was tough for the Solana community, particularly after it was revealed that Alameda’s Research and FTX had entanglements with Solana.</p>



<p>However, assuring the community, Federa noted that they had taken control of all projects linked to the collapsed crypto exchange and its founder. Sam and FTX got involved with the Solana network in the summer of 2020 when they started building Serum, a central limit order book built on-9chain “that couldn’t be built on any other blockchain network”. Serum would later become the first limit order book deployed on a blockchain.</p>



<p><em>“That code has been taken over by the community and relaunched as something called Open Book. So that’s kind of what I was talking about the community healing parts of the ecosystem that Sam and FTX were involved in,” </em>said Federa.</p>



<p>He went on to note that despite the FTX fallout bringing a lot of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-solanas-tumble-amid-the-ftx-collapse-the-community-is-keeping-its-hopes-high/">doom and gloom</a> for Solana, active addresses and validators had shot up, meaning that “more people are using the network than were before.”</p>



<p><em>“The interesting part is that the technology wasn’t part of what happened at all</em>’ he said adding, <em>“What we’ve seen is the community and developers around the world really come together and replace the parts of the ecosystem that had FTX involvement and then expand from there.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 id="h-bye-bye-to-outages-network-instability"><strong>Bye-bye To Outages, Network Instability</strong></h2>



<p>He announced that they were working on improving the network’s processes by building a new validator client.</p>



<p><em>“One of those biggest investments is a second validator client which is really a second copy of the system that runs the network. That means that if one system goes down, there is a second system that can step in,” </em>he added.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The new client would help <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-over-10-network-outages-solana-proposes-a-genius-solution-to-solve-debacle/">eliminate outages</a> and instability problems that have plagued Solana for the past two years. Furthermore, apart from improving performance, it would introduce optimisations that allow people to build products and services that are just as efficient as their web 2 counterparts.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the announcement has sent SOL prices skyrocketing as investors took the news as bullish. In the past 7 days, SOL grew over 43% to tap $24- the highest level since Nov 2022. As of writing, the crypto was trading at $23.60, according to CoinMarketCap data.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter adds 30 more cryptocurrencies to its $Cashtags innovation, which shows real-time prices of assets. </li>



<li>XRP, Tether, and Solana, among others, join Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stocks in line with Twitter’s plan for virtual assets.</li>



<li>Dogecoin faithful celebrate their beloved asset’s inclusion after a shocking snub when the policy started in December.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Elon Musk’s leadership of Twitter has shown its commitment to crypto assets since his takeover last October with new crypto-friendly innovations and more promises for the future.</p>



<p>The social media giant has added 30 more digital assets to its $Cashtags feature which enables users to view the prices and other data of assets by the search icon. The newly listed tokens will join market leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), whose price indexes were incorporated last year.</p>



<p>Twitter added 30 of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, including (XRP), Binance USD (BUSD), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), etc. The Dogecoin community has been the most thrilled since the addition of DOGE to the feature, as it was surprisingly left out last year.</p>



<p>Despite the addition of 30 assets, there are still several snubs as Polkadot (DOT), Tron (TRX), and USD Coin (USDC) failed to make the cut, although following the initial announcement, the policy will continue to expand, covering more assets.</p>



<p>First rolled out on Dec 21, Twitter Business <a href="https://zycrypto.com/twitter-shows-support-for-bitcoin-and-ether-adds-price-indexes-to-search/">announced</a> the $Cashtags feature, making price indexes, data, and graphs available to Twitter users when they search or tweet the names of top financial assets with the dollar sign or the known symbol of the assets. The feature kicked off with the two digital assets, BTC and ETH, with partnerships with Robinhood and TradingView to provide real-time price indexes. </p>



<h2 id="h-doge-snubbed-for-twitter-coin"><strong>DOGE snubbed for Twitter Coin</strong></h2>



<p>After taking over the social media giant, Elon Musk shared big plans for the company, which included support for digital assets by integrating crypto payments with the platform. Although support has been shown for digital assets, their integration as a payment method has taken a step backwards with the Twitter Coin rumours.</p>



<p>The Twitter Coin feature will allow users to award other tweeps using Coins, but recent revelations show that the Twitter Coin will not be a cryptocurrency and will be bought through Stripe. Though not a digital asset, the use of Stripe keeps the hope alive as the company <a href="https://zycrypto.com/stripe-now-supports-cryptocurrencies-once-again-after-changing-its-mind-in-the-past-welcome-the-institutions/">supports</a> payouts in cryptocurrencies and has previously conducted tests on possible digital asset payments on Twitter.</p>
