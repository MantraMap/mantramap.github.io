					<description><![CDATA[While the bear market is still in full swing, several experts are currently discussing when the &#8220;flippening&#8221; will happen. Flippening is described as the scenario where another cryptocurrency overtakes Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of market capitalization. Ethereum is considered the most likely option by many crypto investors &#8211; including Jordi Alexander, CIO of Selini Capital. In an interview with Crypto Banter, Alexander said that he&#8217;s not really a proponent of the flippening, but believes it will happen at some point. &#8220;I do think it&#8217;s going to happen, temporarily at least. It may not stick. I think it&#8217;s likely that it will flip and then we&#8217;ll see a re-flip,&#8221; the CIO said. Further, he stated that he is generally an advocate of Ethereum as it has a lot of use cases as a decentralized app network. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not one of the believers in ultra sound money,&#8221; Alexander continued, stating that the meme that ETH is a better version of Bitcoin and a better version of money, in his opinion, completely misses the point of game theory and psychology of crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised To Resume Its Inclination To Outperform, Says Bloomberg Senior Analyst Not a meme, on the other hand, is a supply squeeze that Ethereum will see at some point, he said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a great tech investment. And I think the tokenomics are great and that we&#8217;ll see a supply squeeze at some point. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s not just a meme. At some point you will run out of coins and where we will see an explosive movement,&#8221; Alexander predicted. For retail investors, Alexander recommended that they allocate half of their capital to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a weighting of 60% ETH and 40% BTC, considering the current market conditions. The remainder he would allocate to identifying new narratives. Ethereum (ETH) Could Outperform Bitcoin Not only the CIO of Selini Capital but also the senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, predicts an outperformance of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. McGlone stated yesterday that Ethereum could be the top candidate to keep topping the first-born cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Could A Litecoin Fractal Foretell A New Bull Trend In Crypto? &#8220;Ethereum&#8217;s advances vs. Bitcoin have been unshaken by 2022 deflation in most risk assets and may be gaining underpinnings,&#8221; McGlone said. As the Bloomberg analyst notes, the Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio is currently around 0.08, the same level as in May 2021, when the Nasdaq 100 stock index was about 20% higher. Our graphic shows the trend of the no. 2 cryptocurrency outperforming no 1, which appeared coincident with the rise of risk assets. [&#8230;] Migration into the mainstream is our takeaway, and once dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressures, Ethereum is more likely to resume doing what it has been &#8212; outperforming. Chris Burniske who led ARK Invest’s crypto efforts and is now a partner at Placeholder VC commented: ETH will make its most serious attempt yet for #1 position next expansion. The expert referred to a tweet by Ryan Berckmans, in which he outlined that Ethereum is well on its way to the flippening. &#8220;The ratio has never done so well in a bear market,&#8221; Berckmans stated. At press time, the Ethereum price stood at $ 1,211 and was rejected at crucial resistance at $1,220. Featured image from Traxer &#124; Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin moved closer to the $17,000 level on Tuesday. The digital currency dropped to $16,400, its lowest level in the last three weeks. As year-end approaches, BTC could face high volatility and low liquidity. Bitcoin Hit A Brief Surge Bitcoin surged to a short-lived peak of $16,837 in today&#8217;s session, barely 24 hours after hitting $16,398. The cryptocurrency saw an impulsive decline after experiencing significant rejection at the resistance level. The sharp fall has been associated with a straight daily decline for the S&#38;P 500 and general nervousness about the Federal Reserve&#8217;s potential to hike interest rates.

This would lead to a spike in the volatility of the asset. Katie Stockton, the founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, has predicted that BTC could retest November lows, dropping “near $15,600, in the coming weeks.” BTC hit an all-time high of $68,997 on Nov. 8, 2021. But the big crypto produced a major shift in market structure by producing a lower low on the weekly timeframe at $32,995 on January 24. This move confirmed the start of a bear market.

<h2>Bitcoin Hit A Brief Surge</h2>
<p>Bitcoin surged to a short-lived peak of $16,837 in today&#8217;s session, barely 24 hours after hitting $16,398. The cryptocurrency saw an impulsive decline after experiencing significant rejection at the resistance level.</p>
<p>The sharp fall has been associated with a straight daily decline for the S&amp;P 500 and general nervousness about the Federal Reserve&#8217;s potential to hike interest rates.</p>

The bears were able to push the price below the $0.30 and $0.280 support levels. The decline gained pace below the $0.265 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). ADA price even spiked below the $0.250 support zone and traded as low as $0.2481. It is now showing a lot of bearish signs near the $0.250 zone, unlike bitcoin and ethereum. It is trading well below $0.280 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $0.255 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2560 on the 4-hours chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first major resistance is forming near the $0.264 zone.

If there is an upside break above the $0.280 and $0.284 resistance levels, the price could start a strong increase. In the stated case, the price could rise steadily towards the $0.32 level. More Losses? If cardano’s price fails to recover above the $0.255 and $0.264 resistance levels, it could continue to move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $0.248 level.

<li>The price is trading above $16,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</li>
<li>There is a rising channel forming with resistance near $17,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could resume its decline unless there is a close above the $17,000 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price found support near the $16,250 zone. BTC traded as low as $16,260 and started a <a href="https://newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-vulnerable-below-17k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recovery wave</a>. There was a clear move above the $16,500 and $16,600 levels.</p>
<p>The bulls were able to push the price above the $16,800 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price even spiked above the $17,000 resistance, but upsides were limited. A high was formed near $17,067 and the price is now trading in a range.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,260 swing low to $17,067 high. It is now trading above $16,800 and the <a href="https://newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-bearish-16-5k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 hourly simple moving average</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a rising channel forming with resistance near $17,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,000 zone. The first major resistance is near the $17,200 zone. A clear move above the $17,200 resistance might call for a move towards the $17,500 resistance.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BTCUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>The next major resistance is near $18,000, above which the price might gain pace and rise towards the $18,450 resistance zone in the coming sessions.</p>
<h2>Fresh Decline in BTC?</h2>
<p>If bitcoin fails to clear the $17,000 resistance, there could be a fresh decline. An immediate support on the downside is near the $16,800 level and the channel trend line.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $16,650 zone. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,260 swing low to $17,067 high. A downside break below the $16,650 support might call for a drop towards the $16,260 level. Any more losses might send the price towards $16,000.</p>
<p>Technical indicators:</p>
<p>Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $16,800, followed by $16,650.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $17,000, $17,200 and $17,500.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Grayscale Investments may offer to buy up to 20% of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust  (GBTC) shares. This is a move the company hopes will close the gap between the GBTC share price and the company&#8217;s underlying Bitcoin holdings. Grayscale Can&#8217;t Act Independent Of Investors The Wall Street Journal released a letter by Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein urging that Grayscale would consider issuing a tender offer should the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and shareholders give their approval. Being a close-ended fund, GBTC shareholders can only liquidate their holdings on the open market. Under the Williams Act (part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that governs tender offers in the US, an investor tendering for a security must disclose their source of funds, legal agreements related to the offer, and reasons for the offer. GBTC trades at $8.08 on the 24-hour chart. Source: TradingView If the company cannot return GBTC shareholders funds, it will continue to offer the tender until it&#8217;s converted to an ETF. Sonnenshein wrote to investors: In the event we are unsuccessful in pursuing options for returning a portion of the capital to shareholders, we do not currently intend to dissolve GBTC, but would instead continue to operate GBTC without an ongoing redemption program until we are successful in converting it to a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with the SEC after its application to convert GBTC to a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 29, 2022. The letter by the CEO was an attempt to ease shareholder concerns after a turbulent few months across the crypto market. Related Reading: GBTC Unlocks Spells Doom For Bitcoin? Top Expert Breaks It Down ETF Conversion Seems To Be Only Option As it stands, Grayscale doesn&#8217;t have a specific timeline for when it may explore other options apart from the ETF conversion. The lawsuit seems to be a long-drawn battle. Grayscale filed its opening brief against the SEC on Oct. 11, 2022. In response, SEC filed a brief on Dec. 13, 2022 denying Grayscale&#8217;s accusations that its rejection was discriminatory and arbitrary. The firm has until Jan. 13, 2023 to respond. Afterwards, a three-judge panel will be selected to listen to oral arguments and rule on the case. Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust has roughly $10.78 billion or 633,000 BTC in assets under management. The fund has failed to meet its goal, and it&#8217;s currently changing hands at a 48.8% discount to Bitcoin. Source: YCharts Sonnenshein didn&#8217;t clarify if the business may later sell off its Bitcoin holdings. However, a market dump like Grayscale could see Bitcoin crashin to a fresh yearly low. Grayscale selling off its Bitcoin stash could also drive down confidence in crypto as significant liquidations for those engaged in Bitcoin derivatives markets. This would hurt crypto volumes, and send a bearish crypto market further down.

The meme coin maintains its position as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies as its total holder count has now crossed 1.26 million. 10,000 New Shiba Inu Holders Added In a time when cryptocurrencies across the space are marking a decline in support, Shiba Inu has added over 10,000 new holders in the span of two weeks. This saw the total SHIB holders cross into the 1.26 million territory, marking more growth for the meme coin. In the last 24 hours alone, the number is up by 0.033%, according to data from Etherscan. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Balks As Dormant Whales Reactivate The meme coin also recently marked another milestone after it crossed more than 1.8 million watchlists on Coinmarketcap. The growth comes even as the price of the digital asset suffers multiple setbacks, drastically dragging down the profit margins for investors.

It is important to keep in mind that the total number of active Shiba Inu addresses currently sits below 5% of its total addresses. This means that there is a decreased activity for the digital asset, which could explain why there have been no positive reactions to the milestones.  The cryptocurrency has also fallen out of favor with large Ethereum whales who no longer hold a significant amount of the cryptocurrency on their balances.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) remains one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies even before the bear market was officially in full bloom. The digital asset which had seen returns higher than 1,000% during the 2021 bull run would eventually see almost the entirety of those gains wiped out. Despite this, it had been able to maintain above a critical point for a long time. However, the cryptocurrency has now lost its footing, leading to an incredibly bearish outlook for the asset. ADA Price Falls Below $0.3 For a digital asset such as ADA, maintaining above $0.3 was important for it at a time when assets in the space needed to hold on to their critical support levels. Most of Cardano’s investors had thrown their hat in the ring to hold the bears off at $0.3, something they succeeded at until the FTX collapse happened.

Last week, it had eventually given way to the bears which had then dragged it down below $.30 for the second time in two months. However, this time around, there was no recovery to save the digital asset and it would continue to spiral down.

According to Price Estimates on Coinmarketcap, there is an expected 84% growth for ADA by the end of 2022 and the projections get higher over a longer timeframe into January 2023. If the estimates come to pass, then ADA could be seeing prices of $0.5 in January. ADA is changing hands at a price of $0.25 at the time of this writing. It is currently down more than 91% from its September 2021 all-time high of $3.10. Featured image from The Coin Republic, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
