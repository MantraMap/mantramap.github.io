<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The trial of former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) became increasingly involved as US District Judge Ronnie Abrams announced his withdrawal from the case.</em></li>



<li><em>Abrams&#8217; husband, Greg D. Andres, is a partner at the law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, which will advise FTX in 2021.</em></li>



<li><em>Now, another judge will be appointed to take over the case.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Late Friday, the judge overseeing Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s (SBF) high-profile criminal prosecution withdrew from the case, citing a potential conflict of interest resulting from the fact that her husband&#8217;s law company had previously provided advice to FTX, SBF&#8217;s now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange.</strong></h5>

<p>US District Judge <strong>Ronnie Abrams</strong> has resigned from the SBF lawsuit due to a conflict of interest. It appears that Abrams&#8217; spouse is a partner at a law company that provided legal counsel to the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.</p>



<p>According to Abrams&#8217; <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23531804/order-in-ftx-case-judge-abrams-recuses-herself-after-delayed-transcripts-unsealed-recusal-order-here-whos-next-innercitypresscom-is-on-it.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order</a>, <strong>Greg D. Andres</strong>, a partner at the legal firm <strong>Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell</strong>, advised <strong>FTX</strong> in <strong>2021</strong>. Andres did not individually advise <strong>FTX</strong>, but <strong>Abrams</strong> made the decision to withdraw from the lawsuit to avoid any potential conflict or the perception of one.</p>

<p>It will now be necessary to choose a new judge from the <strong>Southern District of New York</strong> to preside over SBF&#8217;s trial. There is currently no timetable for when that decision will be made.</p>



<p>In these situations, judges are ordinarily chosen at random to preside over cases and are only disqualified if a potential conflict of interest arises.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154617-ellison-and-wang-spend-decades-in-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, <strong>Caroline Ellison</strong>, former Alameda Research CEO, admitted guilt on seven counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud against FTX customers, wire fraud against FTX customers, conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Alameda lenders, and wire fraud against Alameda lenders. She <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154957-caroline-ellison-admits-to-misled-lenders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testified</a> in federal court in New York that she knew she was acting improperly when she knowingly misled lenders about how much the company had been borrowing from the <strong>FTX</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>A new reporting change for third-party payment networks like Venmo or PayPal has Americans ready.</em></li>



<li><em>Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee will propose increasing the tax reporting threshold for 2022 from $600 to $10,000.</em></li>



<li><em>The possibility of obtaining 1099-Ks for personal transfers has been noted by tax experts as a potential pain point for filers due to the lower tax reporting threshold.</em></li>

<p>To raise the <strong>Form 1099-K </strong>level, <strong>Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.,</strong> would submit an amendment to the <strong>$1.7 trillion spending plan</strong>, according to <strong>Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.</strong>, the proposal&#8217;s principal sponsor.</p>



<p>Many Americans have been watching developments around the<strong> IRS Form-1099K</strong> with great interest. Independent contractors frequently use the form to report earnings on third-party payment networks. Particularly, if it exceeds a limit imposed by the IRS, revenue from services like <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150412-paypal-expands-crypto-services-luxembourg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PayPal</a><strong>, Venmo</strong>, and <strong>CashApp</strong> must be reported.</p>



<p>Taxpayers received <strong>1099-K</strong> with more than <strong>200 transactions</strong> totaling more than <strong>$20,000</strong> before <strong>2022</strong>. Nevertheless, the <strong>American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 </strong>lowered it to merely <strong>$600</strong>. Currently, the form may be activated by even a single transaction totaling more than <strong>$600</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance says India is the hub of web3 innovation.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance is also looking to invest in Indian web3 startups.</em></li>



<li><em>The crypto exchange also intends to hire tech experts from top Indian universities.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Binance&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer Rohit Wad revealed in an interview with Businessline that Binance has been paying close attention to the Indian blockchain ecosystem.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1810-1024x576.png" alt="Binance CTO Announces Investment Plans In Several Indian Web3 Startups" class="wp-image-154970" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1810-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1810-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1810-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1810-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1810-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1810.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance CTO Announces Investment Plans In Several Indian Web3 Startups 10"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Wad revealed that Binance has closely observed the Indian blockchain scene and has found a number of interesting firms and businesspeople. Since <strong>India has a lot to offer in terms of technical skills and expertise</strong>, Binance&#8217;s main objective would be to create a thriving community of developers and coders interested in learning more about decentralized technologies.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;There is going to be a tremendous boom, in the innovation that comes out of India. In fact, as a beginning step, I would like to see if we can find interns in India and get them bootstrapped on crypto,&#8221;</p>
<cite>He said</cite></blockquote>



<p>India is seen as a hub of Web3 innovation, and Mumbai is one of the cities where the company plans to recruit talent. He intends to recruit engineering talent from India&#8217;s leading universities and technology institutions.</p>



<p><strong>Wad intends to hire additional interns from the list of cities, which also includes Mumbai, Toronto, and Vancouver</strong>. As a remote-first business, Binance can successfully recruit people from a variety of international tech hubs.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1811.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="550" height="310" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1811.png" alt="Binance CTO Announces Investment Plans In Several Indian Web3 Startups" class="wp-image-154971" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1811.png 550w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1811-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" title="Binance CTO Announces Investment Plans In Several Indian Web3 Startups 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to Wad, Mumbai is one of the top worldwide locations for innovation incubation, and <strong>Binance plans to hire students and faculty from Mumbai and other Indian tech colleges and universities.</strong></p>



<p>Wad’s interest in India’s tech talents comes close on the heels of a recent survey by Nasscom, and a web3 venture capital fund that said India, with its huge talent pool, is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/india-with-huge-talent-pool-set-to-play-key-role-in-global-web3-push-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all set to play a key role</a> in global web3 transformation.</p>



<p>As in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/80076-india-will-be-a-natural-frontrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous Coincu News article</a>, Binance Founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao emphasized India’s position in web3 and the metaverse, saying the country is a “natural frontrunner” in the creation of the next generation of blockchain applications.</p>



<p><strong>India already has 450 startups in the web3 space</strong>, with four of them having achieved unicorn status in the past year.</p>

<p>Ellison admitted her wrong in <strong>Manhattan federal court</strong>, according to a transcript of the hearing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">From 2019 through 2022, I was aware that Alameda was provided access to a borrowing facility on FTX.com, the cryptocurrency exchange run by Mr. Bankman-Fried, In practical terms, this arrangement permitted Alameda access to an unlimited line of credit without being required to post collateral, without having negative balances and without being subject to margin calls on FTX.com’s liquidation protocols.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-small-font-size">Ellison said</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, and Ellison agreed to conceal the arrangement by <strong>fabricating fake financial statements</strong>, according to Ellison, who also claimed to be aware of Alameda accounts with negative balances indicating <strong>the company was borrowing money from FTX customers.</strong></p>



<p>As Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154617-ellison-and-wang-spend-decades-in-prison/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/154617-ellison-and-wang-spend-decades-in-prison/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, <strong>Ellison and FTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang pled guilty to several offenses</strong> linked to the collapse of Alameda and FTX earlier this week. <strong>Bankman-Fried was extradited to the United States from the Bahamas and appeared in federal court in New York </strong>on Thursday, where a judge announced he&#8217;d be freed on a $250 million bail while awaiting trial.</p>

<p>Additionally, Bloomberg reported that <strong>Wang stated at his guilty hearing that he was &#8220;directed&#8221; to make changes in code that he knew would provide Alameda extraordinary powers. </strong>While Coincu had <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147604-sam-bankman-fried-regrets-filing-bankruptcy/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/147604-sam-bankman-fried-regrets-filing-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> on November 30 that <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried was saying in the interview with Tiffany Fong that he &#8220;does not know how to code&#8221;.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Russia&#8217;s crypto mining bill could be pushed back over fears it could act as a conduit for capital flight.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the bill is expected to be passed soon.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>On December 23, it was reported by the Russian news agency <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1555117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TASS</a> that the Chairman of the Financial Markets Committee of the State Duma Anatoly Aksakov and said the Russia&#8217;s Crypto Mining Bill has been delayed because critics fear it could become a channel for capital loss.</strong></h5>

<p>&#8220;I will not name the organizations that represent down the movement of the bill. At the same time, according to the critics of the bill, it could create channels for capital flight from our country. Ostensibly, it will be the activity of buying cryptocurrency , but in fact, the main objective will be capital flight from our country. That risk probably exists. I&#8217;ll meet with these critics and say &#8211; let&#8217;s finalize it together,&#8221; the lawmaker said.</p>



<p>However, Aksakov believes the bill will be passed soon, saying that it <strong>hopes to pass its first reading in January 2023</strong>. But the passage of the bill could be further delayed if no agreement is reached with competitors next month.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we will initiate this process in January &#8211; the approval in the first reading. This will transpire if I manage to convince the critics that their opinion will be definitely addressed when revising for the second reading. If we do not succeed, they have their own options; we will probably postpone [it]. Still, I believe we will be 90% able to come to terms in order to launch this bill for approval,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>The bill was introduced in the Financial Markets Committee of the State Duma on 17 November 2022 and after being passed into law, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/69405-ukraine-calls-for-changes-to-freeze-russian-and-belarusian-crypto-accounts-28-feb-2022-crypto-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russians</a> will be able to legally mine cryptocurrencies. In addition, the bill allows Russian miners to sell their mining cryptocurrencies on foreign platforms.</p>

<p>Earlier, when a reporter from &#8220;Hong Kong 01&#8221; contacted Chen Zhenxiong, he also replied that <strong>he had resigned </strong>from all posts in AAX over a year ago <strong>but because of the procedure, he forgot to resign as director of &#8220;AAX Technology&#8221;</strong>, or forgot to register this company Dissolved, the company has no actual operation.</p>



<p>As it was updated in an earlier Coincu News article, on November 12 this year that it will be shutting down for system maintenance and updates, so customers cannot buy, sell or withdraw virtual assets. But then key people of the company were found to have denied all communications from users.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Authorities in Italy and Albania have taken down an online investment fraud involving the use of cryptocurrency with the assistance of Eurojust, the cross-border agency of the European Union, for countering organized crime.</em></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>By letting the victims obtain an immediate financial return in exchange for a little initial investment, the offenders won the victims&#8217; trust.</em></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>A united investigation team&#8217;s activity resulted in the seizure of assets worth 3 million euros, Eurojust reported on December 19. Additionally, more than 160 electronic items, including laptops, servers, digital video recorders, and cell phones, were seized.</em></li>

<p>The inquiry determined that an<strong> organized crime gang (OCG)</strong> operating out of a contact center in <strong>Tirana, Albania,</strong> was responsible for the investment fraud. The suspects allegedly used delocalized virtual private networks and anonymous <strong>virtual phone numbers (VPNs) </strong>to call the victims.</p>



<p>According to an announcement made on <strong>December 19</strong> by <strong>Eurojust</strong>, the European Union&#8217;s transnational organization for combating organized crime, assets worth 3 million euros were recovered during the operation. Additionally, more than <strong>160 electronic items</strong>, including<strong> laptops, servers, digital video recorders</strong>, and<strong> cell phones</strong>, were seized.</p>



<p>Victims were requested to open an account and transfer a small amount of money, demonstrating a quick financial gain. Then, despite it being unclear whether any crypto assets were bought, they were approached by scammers acting as brokers that recommended favorable investments in cryptocurrencies with minimal risk.</p>

<p>According to <strong>Eurojust</strong>, victims were then pushed to make much greater investments—in some cases, their whole financial resources. The account information was updated, and the victims were locked out once the larger deposits had been made.</p>



<p>Criminals have found success with cryptocurrency investment schemes, which prey on people looking to make substantial short-term financial gains.</p>



<p>According to police data, crypto fraud <a href="https://news.coincu.com/146983-uk-crypto-fraud-rose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surged</a> by a third in the <strong>UK</strong> in a single year, with thieves stealing hundreds of millions of pounds from victims.</p>

<p>The total value of the purchase is roughly<strong> $53 million</strong>, and both <a href="https://news.coincu.com/128585-sbi-holdings-ceo-co-signed-ripple-i-remit/"><strong>SBI </strong></a>and <strong>Square Enix</strong> intend to make substantial strides in the crypto and blockchain gaming market as a result. According to a news release, SBI planned to combine <strong>Gumi&#8217;s game development </strong>and operational know-how with its own token listing expertise. Both exchanges are owned by SBI. The company further stated that it would use <strong>SBI NFT</strong> as <strong>a secondary distribution market </strong>for NFTs obtained from <strong>Gumi-created games</strong>.</p>



<p>The Tokyo-based gaming company<strong> Gumi</strong> announced the agreement in a press release, detailing how the acquisition would make SBI the company&#8217;s largest stakeholder with <strong>22.46% of the company&#8217;s voting rights</strong>. Due to their investment,<strong> Square Enix</strong> now owns <strong>3.01%</strong> of the company. Among Square Enix&#8217;s many accomplishments are the video game series Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.</p>

<p>Square Enix predicted earlier this year that it would &#8220;<strong>not be enough</strong>&#8221; to continue putting its emphasis on traditional gaming to ensure its future success. User-generated content like <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and play-to-earn crypto games </strong>were mentioned as potential additions to the company&#8217;s future revenue models. Gumi could be Square Enix&#8217;s first hesitant step into space.</p>



<p>A &#8220;<strong>platform dedicated to blockchain games</strong>&#8221; is something that SBI is &#8220;thinking&#8221; launching. It claimed that through &#8220;<strong>collaboration</strong>,&#8221; it could build a one-stop solution in the gaming industry, wherein blockchain games could be created, distributed, and sold, in addition to new forms of digital currency.</p>

<p>The <strong>Commercial Crime Bureau of the Police </strong>held a press conference today on the arrest of a fraud case involving a cryptocurrency trading platform. It is reported that the trading platform involved the Hong Kong crypto exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147946-aax-rug-pull-plan-relationship-aax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAX</a>.</p>

<p>During the press briefing, <strong>Kung Hing-fun</strong>, a member of the Commercial Crime Bureau&#8217;s Fraud division, remarked:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Through false information, news, and illegal means, the trading platform stopped operating, so investors have failed to get back their virtual assets.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Kung</strong> noted that the current investigation might lead to additional arrests.</p>



<p>Authorities claim that before the exchange&#8217;s senior management left <strong>Hong Kong</strong> with the company&#8217;s cryptocurrency wallets and secret keys,<strong> </strong>it<strong> </strong>suspended user withdrawals for <strong>&#8220;fault and maintenance.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/154618-ftx-seeks-help-ownership-robinhood-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, the world’s second-largest virtual currency trading platform, filed for bankruptcy protection, triggering a wave of closures.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147611-disclosure-aax-wallet-addresses-related/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, AAX suddenly closed down in the middle of last month, high-level executives jumped ship, employees were dismissed, investors were unable to withdraw assets, and there were thousands of people in the online suffering group. Some claimed that the loss exceeded one million yuan, and it is estimated that <strong>the total amount involved exceeded 100 million yuan.</strong></p>
