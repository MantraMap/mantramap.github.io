<p>Most crypto enthusiasts are familiar with older crypto giants that have made a lot of money for investors since their introduction to the crypto market. While these crypto giants have created a lot of profit for investors, it has become necessary for investors to seek out new DeFi projects to earn money from. Thankfully, new crypto projects with viable utilities are constantly added to the market, giving investors more options.</p>
<p>InQubeta (QUBE) is one of the latest crypto projects whose presale has already made money for investors after its Beta stage. InQubeta's presale indicates it could be more profitable than an older crypto giant like Cardano (ADA). More investors are putting their money into InQubeta to increase their profit margins in the coming months.</p>
<p>InQubeta's (QUBE) Presale Forges Ahead in the Crypto Market</p>
<p>InQubeta has successfully launched a presale that crypto enthusiasts are eager to participate in. With an ecosystem designed to offer an easy pathway to the AI market, InQubeta is slowly gaining the trust of reputable crypto investors. InQubeta's presale has recorded unprecedented success in the crypto market, increasing investors' chances of becoming wealthy through this project.</p>
<p>The QUBE token presale is divided into 10 stages, and each stage has an allocated number of tokens to be sold at a different price. The price of QUBE increases at the beginning of a new presale stage, ensuring the token's value grows as the presale progresses. The first presale stage, the Beta stage, was recently completed, pushing QUBE into its second presale phase, Stage 1.</p>
<p>The DeFi coin price of QUBE in its current stage is $0.00875, and there are 100,000,000 QUBE tokens to be sold. InQubeta's presale has raised over $600,000, and it will only raise more before the presale stages are complete. In the next stage, QUBE will be sold for $0.0098, drawing closer to its launch price of $0.0308. InQubeta is one of the most profitable new DeFi projects, as its presale also features bonuses for investors.</p>
<p>Once the presale ends, InQubeta's ability to link AI startups and investors will make it even more popular among investors. With an NFT marketplace that allows AI startups to connect with potential investors, InQubeta is set to become one of the best DeFi projects the crypto market has ever seen. InQubeta's NFT marketplace is built on the Ethereum blockchain, increasing its credibility and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All transactions within InQubeta are paid for using the QUBE token. This increases the token's value, solidifying InQubeta's position as an excellent project to add to your portfolio in 2023. As more investors notice InQubeta's value, its DeFi coin price is only likely to increase, making it an excellent investment option for the future. Some believe it could 10x by the end of the year, and it definitely has all the key components of a crypto that could explode in value.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) Maintains its Position as a Crypto Giant</p>
<p>Cardano was created using a research-based approach to crypto development. The crypto giant is one of the most popular blockchains for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). It also offers a highly sustainable network with increased transaction processing speeds.</p>
<p>Cardano seeks to build a network that is not limited by bandwidth, promising a wider reach for blockchain developers in the crypto market. Cardano has remained one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies since it was launched. Its native token, ADA, runs operations on the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cardano is one of the best DeFi projects in the crypto market; however, investors are looking for new cryptos to diversify their portfolios. InQubeta's presale has created a more profitable opportunity for investors to earn more money. This is why InQubeta's presale is selling out fast and gaining momentum among investors.</p>
<p>The QUBE token may be the most profitable crypto token of 2023. Its ecosystem promises to give investors better investment opportunities that will increase the value of their holdings. Investing in its presale now is a great way to ensure you are not left out when InQubeta's price rises.</p>
