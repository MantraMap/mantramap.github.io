<p>Polygon Labs, the development team behind Ethereum scaling solution <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/polygon">Polygon</a>, has announced its new native token, POL. Through a Twitter announcement, Polygon Labs proposed an upgrade plan to replace the existing token, MATIC, with POL — thereby establishing POL as the exclusive token for all networks within the Polygon ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today, the next technical proposal of Polygon 2.0 is unveiled:<br><br>POL, the upgraded token of the Polygon protocol! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4ab.png" alt="💫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>POL is the next generation native token, designed to secure, align and grow the Polygon ecosystem.<br><br>Watch the video to get an idea how cool it is, then <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Gn7KcHpWEY">pic.twitter.com/Gn7KcHpWEY</a></p>&mdash; Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1679427540790681600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>These networks include the Polygon mainnet, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/matic-magic-polygon-co-founder-proposes-radical-transformation-of-pos-blockchain/">Polygon zkEVM network</a>, and various Supernet chains (dedicated application chains running on the Polygon mainnet). If the proposal is accepted, POL will serve as a multi-purpose token, enabling network validators to support the operation of multiple chains using a single token.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_O1labsgjfONJaVrn3897sp_dgZpnEJ3bEJhWBR1nErZCKLmmNGWqOUGJbMJrkSjgU6M63jAHuKnjL0wMZTnAoKXcosWjlzftQt38ZUmHGl_Z9NNyzPaGMtplJv56pG5TAVHULITFYyFzuAaC44Sdg0" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Polygon Blog</figcaption></figure>



<p>Upgrading from MATIC to POL would demand an upfront technical procedure: MATIC will have to be sent to an upgraded smart contract, automatically retrieving an equivalent amount in POL. If the community supports this initiative, token holders will have sufficient time to upgrade, such as four years or longer.</p>



<p>Each community of the Polygon chains will ultimately decide which token to use as gas fees. Some may opt for POL, and token holders can utilize POL to vote on governance proposals for DApps built on Polygon, with all rewards and incentives distributed in POL.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/MATICUSD/">TradingView data</a>, after the news was released, the price of the MATIC token rose from approximately $0.73 to $0.77 within an hour, representing a growth of over 5%.</p>

<ul>
<li>Galaxy Digital CEO believes Bitcoin (BTC) will finish the year on a high following a string of positives.</li>



<li>He notes that approving a Bitcoin ETF will be instrumental in pushing the asset class to new highs.</li>



<li>The U.S. SEC currently stands in staunch opposition to a spot ETF, but a wave of applications could see it lower its guard.</li>
</ul>



<p>Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz opines that if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gives the green light for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), it will turn around the fortunes of the largest virtual currency.</p>



<p>Novogratz disclosed in an interview with BloombergTV, noting that the SEC’s thumbs up for ETFs may be construed as a “seal of approval” for the asset class. He noted that a spike in the number of ETF applications in recent months has contributed to BTC’s meteoric rise in 2023.</p>



<p>BlackRock, Ark Invest, and WisdomTree have all <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">submitted</a> their applications for a spot Bitcoin ETFs, braving multiple rejections from the SEC.</p>



<p><em>“What I do think is BlackRock, Invesco, and the group of ETF providers is a real signal that adoption is coming,”</em> said Novogratz.</p>



<p>He pointed out that after over a decade since the first ETF application, the industry has garnered enough infrastructure to support the operations of ETFs. Novogratz added that akin to the approval of a futures ETF in 2021, the SEC may approve several firms at a go, given the similarities of their applications.</p>



<p><em>“The SEC is not going to approve one, so you’re going to have these giant sales forces out there giving access to people that didn’t have access before,” </em>Novogratz said.</p>



<p>He notes that the approval will send Bitcoin’s value soaring as new investors interact with the ETFs. In the weeks following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-the-first-u-s-bitcoin-etf-debuts-grayscale-ceo-sees-an-ethereum-etf-rolling-out/">approval</a> of a BTC futures ETF, the asset reached its all-time high of $69,789.</p>



<p>However, Novogratz expressed scepticism over the SEC granting approvals before the end of the year, noting its hard stance toward cryptocurrencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-sec-s-argument-against-spot-etfs"><strong>The SEC’s argument against spot ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC has pointed out that spot BTC ETFs do not offer enough protections for individual investors, claiming that “the underlying spot market of bitcoin is subject to fraud and manipulation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the SEC rejected a batch of applications in June, it noted that the sections on a surveillance-sharing agreement with a trading platform were inadequate. Including the surveillance-sharing agreement has been described as the answer to the SEC’s concerns about price manipulation.</p>

<p>Against the odds of the broader crypto market, the value of XRP, the cryptocurrency linked to Ripple, has significantly skyrocketed, providing comfort to holders. The crypto asset has been able to draw the market&#8217;s attention following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">latest judge ruling that XRP is not a security</a>.</p>



<p>The price of XRP increased dramatically over the past hour by around 28%, passing the significant $0.6 price level. XRP holders and enthusiasts now feel more optimistic as a result of Ripple&#8217;s victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The distinctive qualities and prospective uses of XRP inside the financial sector contribute to its growing popularity.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that XRP&#8217;s path has not been without challenges. The firm behind XRP, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-not-a-security-crypto-lawyer-muses-about-lessons-from-telegram-case-for-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit/">Ripple, has been battling</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court over the cryptocurrency&#8217;s regulatory status. The result of this issue has always had a big impact on XRP&#8217;s future and its ability to function in the financial sector freely.</p>



<p>Despite the legal issues, XRP&#8217;s rigidity exemplifies the community of holders&#8217; tenacity. This development shows market participants value and see potential in crypto assets despite legislative uncertainty.</p>



<p>The peculiar position that XRP occupies in the market is another factor contributing to its growing demand. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP acts as a medium of exchange for quick and inexpensive international transactions. Because of this functionality, financial institutions and payment processors have partnered with Ripple and worked with them.</p>



<p>Investors are carefully monitoring XRP&#8217;s essential support and resistance levels as it continues to gain traction. The current support level for the coin is $0.58, while the current resistance level is $0.644. These levels will probably be important in determining the direction of XRP&#8217;s price movement as we advance.</p>



<p>Despite the enthusiasm that the recent increase in XRP&#8217;s value has generated among cryptocurrency investors, it is crucial to exercise caution, given the market&#8217;s inherent volatility. As the case moves to trial, long-term prospects for XRP will likely be impacted by regulatory changes and the legal proceedings surrounding Ripple&#8217;s SEC complaint results.</p>



<p>However, the XRP community can now celebrate this comeback as the token&#8217;s successful performance instils a spirit of optimism and fresh zeal among its fans. Although the direction of XRP is still unclear, the recent increase serves as a reminder of its resiliency and promise in the face of a complex regulatory environment.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs has scored a major court victory after the federal judge presiding over the American blockchain payments company’s case against the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that the XRP token is not a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the monumental ruling that could essentially reshape the crypto industry, XRP exploded by over 35%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-judge-delivers-vital-summary-judgment-verdict"><strong>Judge Delivers Vital Summary Judgment Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres has granted summary judgment in favor of Ripple, indicating that the XRP token is not a security.</p>



<p>Torres asserted that programmatic sales to public buyers and distributions of XRP to Ripple’s employees did not constitute the sale of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>She, however, ruled that $728 million worth of contracts for institutional sales did constitute unregistered securities sales and those investors &#8220;would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple’s efforts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Torres noted: &#8220;Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances surrounding the Institutional Sales, the Court concludes that Ripple’s Institutional Sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the lawsuit <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">lodged </a>in December 2020 by the SEC against Ripple and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen, the regulator aimed to compel Ripple to stop offering XRP to customers under the assertion that XRP was a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By granting the summary judgment motion, Torres leaves the case open until a jury can weigh in at trial or if Ripple and SEC reach a settlement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Skyrockets 35.5%</strong></h2>



<p>The positive ruling sent a ripple across the market after the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap dodged a securities classification. XRP surged from $0.45 to $0.63. This puts the token up over 35.5% as of the time of publication, according to data from CoinGecko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto analyst Adam Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1679515809893294080">observed </a>that the ruling was a “big win for XRP” given its centralized foundation, with key figureheads, standard sales through exchanges, and formal distribution programs.</p>



<p>“We said in Dec 2020 that we were on the right side of the law and will be on the right side of history,&#8221; Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse said in <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1679520607837253639?s=20">a tweet</a>. &#8220;Thankful to everyone who helped us get to today’s decision — one that is for all crypto innovation in the US. More to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The former CEO of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network was reportedly arrested on Thursday. The news was accompanied by a series of lawsuits against Mashinsky and Celsius by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mashinsky-arrested"><strong>Mashinsky Arrested</strong></h2>



<p>The law has finally caught up to Alex Mashinsky.</p>



<p>The former Celsius CEO was arrested on Thursday after a probe into the company&#8217;s collapse, as per a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment. Mashinsky was indicted on charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, and intention to manipulate the price of Celsius&#8217; token CEL.</p>



<p>Celsius, which was one of the crypto market’s highest-profile collapses, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ghosts-of-terra-awake-as-celsius-token-crashes-by-50-after-firm-pauses-withdrawals/">halted withdrawals </a>in June 2022, citing “extreme market conditions,” and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-1-month-of-halting-customers-withdrawals-giant-crypto-lender-celsius-goes-bankrupt/">filed </a>for bankruptcy protection a month later. At one point the New Jersey-based company held $30 billion in assets. A court-ordered bankruptcy examiner’s report showed that Celsius made extremely risky investment bets with clients’ funds.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-13/sec-files-lawsuit-against-celsius-network-alex-mashinsky?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business#xj4y7vzkg">According to</a> <em>Bloomberg </em>sources, Mashinsky contrived a scheme to defraud customers of Celsius Network between 2018 and June 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celsius was a popular crypto lending platform that allowed users to deposit cash and earn returns on their digital assets. However, following the implosion of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST and the subsequent crypto market downturn, the firm was unable to fulfil a wave of customer withdrawals.</p>



<p>Celsius’ chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon was also arrested alongside Mashinsky.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mashinsky’s Legal Woes</strong></h2>



<p>To add to Mashinsky’s woes, the SEC accused him and Celsius of securities fraud in a suit filed today. In the complaint, the SEC declared that CEL and Celsius&#8217; Earn product constituted securities.</p>



<p>“In this case, Celsius offered and sold CEL and the Earn Interest Program as securities…. Celsius and Mashinsky never filed a registration statement or had one in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of securities through the Earn Interest Program,” the filing read.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s fellow regulators, the CFTC and FTC, also filed civil actions against the former figurehead and Celsius on the same day. </p>



<p>The CFTC accused Mashinsky and Celsius of violating federal commodities regulations and participating in a &#8220;scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of customers by mispresenting the safety and profitability of its digital asset-based finance platform.&#8221;</p>



<p>The suit by the FTC alleges that Mashinsky and the firm broke the Federal Trade Commission Act &#8220;in connection with the marketing and sale of cryptocurrency lending and custody services.&#8221;</p>



<p>Notably, Mashinsky is already facing a lawsuit <a href="https://decrypt.co/118491/new-york-attorney-general-ex-celsius-boss-alex-mashinksy">filed</a> by New York attorney general Letitia James in January this year. The AG accuses him of misleading Celsius investors, leading to billions of dollars in losses.</p>

<p>The year has presented a lot of ups and downs for blockchain networks. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/solana">Solana</a>, one of the most promising proof-of-stake networks in the industry, has not been spared by the harsh market conditions.</p>



<p>After hitting a bump in the second quarter of the year, following a major pushback from regulatory bodies, Solana is attempting to strengthen its position as one of the major pioneers of DeFi in the industry.</p>



<p>According to key <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q2-2023?utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=twitter_messari&amp;utm_campaign=state_of_solana_q2_2023">insights</a> shared by Messari Crypto, a leading crypto intelligence firm, the Solana network saw its financial performance suffer from regulatory pushback.</p>



<p>Notably, the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission blacklisted several digital currencies, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-buterin-voices-sympathy-for-solana-and-other-tokens-targeted-by-sec/">including Solana (SOL)</a>. The U.S. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/far-from-securities-solana-polygon-and-cardano-issue-solid-statements-against-sec-claims/">SEC alleged </a>that a handful of cryptocurrency exchanges have unlawfully engaged in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities, including SOL, MATIC, ADA, and many other assets.</p>



<p>Leading platforms like Robinhood, Revolut, and Bakkt delisted SOL. These actions, along with the SEC&#8217;s complaints, will later coincide with the downward pressure on the value of SOL, which declined by 9.2%, compared to the broader market’s 1.3% increase in QoQ.</p>



<p>SOL closed the second quarter as the 10th largest cryptocurrency, as its market cap settled at $7.2 billion.</p>



<p>“<em>Revenue in SOL (total transaction fees paid in SOL) was supported by higher priority fees paid in Q1 2023. However, revenue in SOL decreased by 15.0% QoQ as the percentage of daily fees paid in the local fee markets declined.</em>” Messari further asserted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the week, Solana (SOL) has outperformed its competitors as it managed to sustain weekly gains, while other altcoins remained in the red zone. SOL has surged by more than 10% within the last 7 days. The market cap is currently on the verge of hitting $9 billion. SOL now trades at a press time price of $22.31.</p>



<p>Expanding DeFi is at the forefront of Solana’s vision as we advance. However, as part of its comprehensive growth strategy, the Solana ecosystem is committed to broadening into other sectors. Data from Messari shows that liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) have continued to support Solana and its DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>Solend, one of the leading DeFi protocols on the Solana network, recently saw a 59% growth in its transaction volume. Solend would outperform Orca to become the largest DeFi protocol on the Solana network. The protocol now contributes to the new capital inflow entering the Solana DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<ul>
<li>Virtual currency scams are down by a staggering 65% since the start of 2023.</li>



<li>Two of the largest scams end operations while romance and investment scams run out of steam.</li>



<li>On the flip side, experts warn investors to brace for increased ransomware attacks targeted at digital asset wallets.</li>
</ul>



<p>As crypto asset prices stage a brave recovery in mid-2023, there has been a marked decline in the activities of digital asset scammers, but the threat of ransomware still lurks in the shadows.</p>



<p>On July 12, Chainalysis released its “Crypto Crime Mid-year Update”, indicating a major slump in digital asset scams. According to the <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-crime-midyear-2023-update-ransomware-scams/?mkt_tok=NTAzLUZBUC0wNzQAAAGM6wGWvw9ud1Yw3cbLMTJ0ztxTgBByxK-1ZylygyLCUc1qkfF88Ly4lCbOQXPMc1_8LSeptcWk0NGLl30d9KEEWSaCKkGm-_KwCLNP5GRxX4yZ">report</a>, on-chain analytics to well-known scams and shady mixers are down by over 50%.</p>



<p>The decline in scam revenue is noteworthy as it comes on the heels of a strong resurgence of virtual currencies, with average prices up by 80%.</p>



<p><em>“Usually, positive price movements translate to higher scam revenue, likely because increased market exuberance and FOMO make victims more susceptible to scammers’ pitches. But 2023’s drastic scam declines that long-standing trend,”</em> said Chainalysis.</p>



<p>In its report, Chainalysis rationalizes the plummeting scam activity to the disappearance of major crypto scams &#8211; VidiLook and Chia Tai Tianquing. At the height of their powers, both investment scams defrauded victims of over $130 million worth of digital assets following the shutting down of their operations.</p>



<p><em>“VidiLook’s exit scam isn’t surprising, but what is surprising is that total scam revenue remains so low after its decline</em>,” read the report. “<em>Ordinarily, we’d expect new scams to fill the void.”</em></p>



<p>Another reason for the declining revenue for scammers is the increase in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/rising-crypto-based-pig-butchering-scams-worry-fbi-interpol/">public advisories</a> by law enforcement agencies, warning victims of the dangers of investing in unlicensed virtual currency offerings.</p>



<p>While investment, pig butchering, and romance scams have borne the brunt of the hit, impersonation scams are thriving. Chainalysis’ data indicates that impersonation scams have surged by 49% in the last 12 months, with more individuals falling victim to extortions from fake law enforcement officers.</p>



<p>Despite the wins notched by the industry, Chainalysis warns that ransomware crime is gathering momentum and could net as much as $800 million before the end of the year. Ransomware gangs are “big game hunting” &#8211; opting to target large corporations over smaller entities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-failing-to-sustain-the-highs-of-2022"><strong>Failing to sustain the highs of 2022</strong></h2>



<p>In 2022, virtual currency scams reached their zenith, with bad actors stealing over $6 billion from their victims. Pig butchering scams and ransomware attacks reigned supreme while hacks against Ronin, Wormhole, and Nomad rocked the industry.</p>



<p>State-backed cybercriminals from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-assists-us-law-enforcement-in-seizing-4-4m-linked-to-north-korean-organized-crime-freezes-accounts/">North Korea</a> pilfered over $1 billion throughout 2022, with the bulk of stolen funds used to finance the development of nuclear warheads. North Korea-based Lazarus Group was fingered in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/harmonys-one-token-nosedives-double-digits-after-hacker-drained-100m-from-horizon-bridge/">$100 million heist</a> on the Horizon Bridge and may have masterminded the attack against Atomic Wallet.</p>

<p>The outspoken CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, believes that the recent spate of applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) from high-profile asset managers if approved, would represent a “seal of approval” for crypto from the U.S. government and its top securities watchdog. This means the potential approvals would signal wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. He points to $9 trillion asset manager BlackRock as a signal of this coming adoption.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spot-etf-approval-is-the-long-awaited-seal-of-approval-for-btc"><strong>Spot ETF Approval Is The Long-Awaited “Seal of Approval” For BTC</strong></h2>



<p>The greenlight of spot bitcoin ETFs would basically be a nod for crypto from the United States government and its securities regulator.</p>



<p>During a July 12 <a href="https://youtu.be/3_3CvNhs2FE">interview </a>with <em>Bloomberg</em>, Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz highlighted the potential of ETFs that track the spot market value of bitcoin (as opposed to existing futures-based ETFs) in driving widespread cryptocurrency adoption. “What I do think is BlackRock, Invesco [and] the group of ETF providers is a real signal that adoption is coming,” Novogratz posited.</p>



<p>The moment finance giant BlackRock <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">filed </a>to introduce a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., industry observers believed that the world’s largest asset manager had a high chance of approval than the many rejected predecessors due to its nearly flawless ETF application record.</p>



<p>In Novogratz’s opinion, many investors are nervous about dipping their toes into the crypto market. The okaying of a spot bitcoin ETF may be the first step for most to begin pouring their money into crypto.</p>



<p><em>“I just think if it happens, it’s the seal of approval from the SEC and the U.S. government.”</em></p>



<p>The crypto bull indicated that the SEC was not only going to approve BlackRock’s proposed ETF but also the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">filings </a>from other applicants, including Valkyrie, Fidelity,&nbsp; Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, and ARK Invest. “So you’re going to have these giant sales forces out there giving access to people that didn’t have access before,” Novogratz observed.</p>



<p>However, he warned that the U.S.&#8217;s regulatory environment is still frustrating, with the SEC maintaining a &#8220;really tough&#8221; stance on crypto assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Novogratz Expects BTC To End The Year Higher&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Mike Novogratz also noted that the world is currently in the early stages of accepting Bitcoin as a macro asset.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, he still thinks the flagship cryptocurrency’s ongoing consolidation phase, around $28,000 and $32,000, will likely be the harbinger of a significant bull rally. “If you take out the top, we’ll have a nice leg up,” Novogratz predicted, noting that he expects bitcoin to trade higher by the close of 2023.</p>



<p>This potential meteoric upsurge, as per Novogratz, will happen when the U.S. Federal Reserve pivots and flinches in response to the increased interest and appetite for BTC.</p>

<p>The United States government has once again moved Bitcoin tied to Silk Road, the now-shuttered darknet marketplace.</p>



<p>Two wallets belonging to the U.S. Justice Department moved over $300 million worth of Bitcoin to two new addresses on Wednesday morning. The transfer was conducted in three different transactions, as <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/bc1qmxjefnuy06v345v6vhwpwt05dztztmx4g3y7wp">shown </a>by on-chain data from Blockchain.com.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-300-million-in-btc"><strong>$300 Million In BTC</strong></h2>



<p>Some of Silk Road’s bitcoins are on the move once again.</p>



<p>Fed-controlled wallets sent a total of 9,825 Bitcoin, equating to approximately $301 million. Wednesday’s transaction follows an even bigger transaction in March when roughly <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1633331891347820544">$1 billion worth of BTC</a> was transferred, a move that prompted a drop across all top cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. authorities have control of BTC that&#8217;s been confiscated from bad actors and occasionally move it around. Previously, they&#8217;ve done so because they plan to sell it — but not all the time.</p>



<p>The latest transfer has stoked investor fears that intense sell pressures could drive down the price of Bitcoin. BTC dipped after the transaction was sent. The premier cryptocurrency was, at the time of publication trading hands for $30,327.04 per coin, a 0.8% 24-hour drop. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Silk Road Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Feds seized more than 50,000 bitcoins in November 2022 from hacker James Zhong, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud over the hack of these digital assets from the Ross Ulbricht-run Silk Road back in 2012.</p>



<p>Ross Ulbricht is the proprietor of the Silk Road online black market, which was used to mostly buy and sell illicit goods such as weapons, drugs, and stolen credit card information and primarily used bitcoin as a payment method before authorities closed it in 2014. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in federal prison back in 2015 in a high-profile case. He’s currently serving a double life sentence plus 40 years without the possibility of parole. </p>



<p>Court filings contained details of related BTC wallets, allowing online sleuths to track these wallet addresses. Feds have been selling the seized BTC bit by bit. After selling the crypto in March, the U.S. authorities said they intended to dump the remaining bitcoin in four more batches throughout 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a much-anticipated release, CoinMarketCap, the renowned cryptocurrency information platform, exposed its &#8220;Unveilling the Crypto Market&#8221; exchange <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/unveiling-the-crypto-market-a-comprehensive-guide-to-exchange-activities-in-h1-2023">report</a> for the initial half of 2023. This comprehensive analysis delves into two prominent categories: centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX), presenting valuable insights into the market dynamics. This report offers a captivating snapshot of the current landscape by scrutinizing the trading volume disparity between CEX and DEX and evaluating the performance of exchange tokens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinmarketcap-centralized-exchange-cex-data-revealed"><strong>CoinMarketCap Centralized Exchange (CEX) Data Revealed</strong></h2>



<p>First, the report looks at the total spot trading volume of the top 20 exchanges in the past four quarters. It is recognised that the trading volume in the first quarter of this year has increased by about 26% compared with the previous quarter. CoinMarketCap believes that there will be such apparent growth. Bitcoin rose 72.1% in the quarter, driven by the asset&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>However, trading volumes slowed significantly in the second quarter, down about 36% quarter-on-quarter. CoinMarketCap says current trading volumes are very similar to market conditions observed during the recovery phase of the FTX crash.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1HGpmyrVPa2ovku8WvEuQQGxO1ZSK8-3P6BC8eBKJ8bYz1e9hnq6GlAeLfBC-Jr_W1MDRfolWgtCh1pFu1llk8yUz_P6v8b559OE6ck1CTjSRIz8DycBbblGZ_I4eZW4jBMO3ZccgfR06Gc1w7vxos8" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Looking at the various exchanges separately, Binance still exhibits dominance on the spot market share and reached nearly 60% in February this year &#8211; which later dropped to about 47%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fjYRItVGxuCPfJo05hbwBO-ZLiA6TPqIIVvv6EQuQdkMZr2xhgyDdpg5-FB0nQvOEwdpyZV2ATV9wRTZHFFd7hPNwxvaBGGUMiQbyeQQbK5YdGV8t5IvZthWPjmMX0y6XhJM65-XNukRvV0yEQ4tV8E" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Among these exchanges, Gate.io has the most trading pairs (Current Number of Markets), followed by Binance. However, regarding the number of cryptocurrencies (Current Number of Coins), Binance shares less spotlight. CoinMarketCap said that this is mainly due to Binance selecting high-quality mainstream coins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6ZBAozSO8Ke6ZaElxH7HtfBdcuzXP1uEHSS5xU7M6_o6CBJOQ8WnWt4IErbrjDfiSX2_AOsgwXOCI-8oWuO42cwAjtJr1myKLyo2pMwiwL2V3Ew33OPTD-f-zsfWMNmv5aIkUYGqz-HCjZhI4g7mgV0" alt=""/></figure>



<p>As for security, Binance ($57 billion), OKX ($10 billion) and Bitfinex ($10 billion) have the highest proof of asset reserves among the disclosed exchanges, with most exchanges holding more than 1,000 bitcoins Coins and stablecoins.</p>



<p>As the figure below highlights, Binance’s reserve assets declined significantly in June. This phenomenon is related to the market triggered by the SEC’s prosecution. The outflow of funds led to a decrease of about 20 billion U.S. dollars in Binance’s reserves.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DC5_1BJu4MQRmyzpWDnBlWTDuzyHjj-K0aA8eIDS24Kvx6--cXo5VBB5xfW1parHYvAwDzTAXMDMKgAUyeUIgC2JEIhqfrGLyfyTukYvvGuJaD4dKmkC_arBNeuMR8jt4ijv6fBDI9DT49FxFBLbSCE" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Although the trading volume of exchanges this year is not particularly outstanding, and the market conditions are relatively deserted, most exchange tokens are flat or rising this year, and only Huobi Token has experienced a significant decline.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OPDO3PUAqRkRi2_EQ1g4MaEZ8tt9ilR00gsTcJ9bgmepRi6K3fobCJsZMf5Nh0Gk4B3Um-UZX6MuTsBaonXdfyD8x08tDVWyV_VbS4bVI8vE8CI9X4CCtcLT-AaDzizh1bDW6f92M7JNQnUewm1ZkdY" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinMarketCap Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Data Revealed</strong></h2>



<p>Following the examination of CEXs, the report brings down the data of DEXs. The trading volume of the top 15 exchanges peaked in March this year. Although the trading volume dropped in the second quarter, the factor maintains stability. Transaction volume in the second quarter was $189 billion, down 24% quarter-over-quarter.</p>



<p>Among these exchanges, Uniswap has the highest proportion of trading volume this year, 57.5%, far exceeding other competitors. It is then followed by Pancakeswap and Curve, with 12.7% and 11.5% respectively.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K5GuMOV8lv_1OhWr5kPYKyqfWqXuss-cz-ZmQYdcTQVgbnevcd8K4cYOlHvtCsrBk9mPptcqEhyYBcjEi8ZBTGt3ApePap3_ckBI1gfw6Oh8IRN63qSx__beHMlcR_ot2yVn4C4n6JLogGEgJNl9ZQY" alt=""/></figure>



<p>If Uniswap is compared with centralized exchanges, its trading volume is equal to Coinbase&#8217;s but still far from Binance&#8217;s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/d9CCzqkzJu0p7yIxbo4albGNhiUiMe1DBHc6qNHFEKr3w8Qne-YMxaI6WImJFKgFgIhQ5xE4nldpKr8X8qiRoWoDGErsuYpifxf6jDvMobYh_lbRRsw9WjVXBYb3eG51LtCCyvO87XTfE_jXjWNWxcY" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Since the beginning of this year, the ratio of DEX trading volume to CEX spot trading volume has gradually increased and is currently about 1:8. CoinMarketCap believes this can be attributed to several factors, including:</p>



<ol>
<li>The latest developments in DEX products.</li>



<li>Regulatory intervention raises concerns about CEXs.</li>



<li>More favourable environment and lower gas costs.</li>

<p>Finally, Ethereum usage still dominates all blockchains, with about 80% of DEX transaction volume happening on Ethereum and its Layer 2. However, in the second quarter of this year, the DEX transaction volume on the BNB chain also increased, accounting for about 15%</p>

<p>Some metrics on the Bitcoin blockchain appear to reflect a pattern that implies confidence amongst market players. According to data from Glassnode’s on-chain insight, the current level of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/will-bitcoin-reach-120000-by-2024-standard-chartereds-optimistic-btc-outlook-proves-attainable/">Bitcoin’s On-Chain Activity</a> reveals that metrics are approaching levels associated with a re-accumulation period.</p>



<p>As Glassnode explains, the supply held in profit vs in loss has reached equilibrium. This is often synonymous with several month-long &#8216;re-accumulation periods&#8217; in previous times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Find out more in the latest Week On-Chain assessing the current level of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> On-Chain activity, where several metrics are approaching levels associated with a &#39;re-accumulation period&#39;.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447-1f3fc.png" alt="👇🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/WzrxyJz3tJ">https://t.co/WzrxyJz3tJ</a> <a href="https://t.co/Hec1XLqcHH">pic.twitter.com/Hec1XLqcHH</a></p>&mdash; glassnode (@glassnode) <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1679049380303601665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The market is currently consolidating below the $30,000 midpoint, and 75% of the total supply is still in-profit, while 25% is held in loss. Notably, this pattern imitates the same balance recorded when prices reached the midpoints in 2016 and 2019.</p>



<p>The 75:25 balance of supply held in profit:loss is an equilibrium point for the apex cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, higher Profit-to-Loss balances have been recorded on 50% of all trading days, while the remaining 50% was recorded on a lower one.</p>



<p><em>“This equilibrium point has historically taken time for the market to digest and re-consolidate around. Many Bitcoin analysts refer to this as the &#8216;re-accumulation period&#8217;, which tends to straddle the halving event. We can visualize this by looking at the proportion of the Market cap held at an Unrealized Loss. During the primary bear, the market is plunged deep into the red, with investors gradually capitulating out.” &#8211; Glassnode.</em></p>



<p>It bears mentioning that as the market forms and rallies off the lows, profitability levels have risen sharply to reach levels aligning with current market patterns. In the past, re-accumulation periods have been characterized by a lack of macro market direction which tends to be volatile and trades sideways for months.</p>



<p><em>“With the market back at this equilibrium point, it remains to be seen if a similarly lengthy and choppy process is needed to overcome it. On-chain activity for Bitcoin is cooling down somewhat, driven mostly by a decline in Inscription activity. Monetary transfer volumes, however are starting to pick up, displaying positive momentum often associated with growing liquidity and adoption.” Glassnode asserted.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin still struggles to sustain momentum at the $30,000 price level. The leading cryptocurrency has recorded a mild price decline over the last 7 days. Bitcoin now trades at a press time price of $30,356, not long after hitting a high of $30,959 a day ago.</p>

<p>John E. Deaton, the well-known crypto lawyer who represents over <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-joining-75000-xrp-holders-against-the-sec-does-not-affect-potential-recovery-for-xrp-holders/">76,000 XRP holders</a> in the lawsuit of the SEC against Ripple, went to Twitter recently to clarify his views on why XRP is not a security, drawing on lessons from other recent lawsuits.</p>



<p>He opened his argument by stating: <em>“XRP is not a security. Just as beavers, orange groves, whiskey, chinchillas, condos, and Bitcoin are not securities. All of these assets may have been once marketed, packaged, offered, and sold as an investment contract, but the asset remained what it always was.”</em></p>



<p>Although BTC was initially offered as an investment contract, that specific sale did not change the cryptocurrency&#8217;s nature from that of a digital commodity.</p>



<p>While many attorneys believe Judge Torres won&#8217;t address XRP or secondary sales, Deaton disagrees. He contended that Judge Torres would have to reject a sizable chunk of the SEC&#8217;s argument on XRP to ignore the underlying asset issue or secondary sales.</p>



<p>Deaton believes that Judge Torres would immediately address the fundamental asset issue and secondary sales in the ongoing lawsuit concerning Ripple, similar to her colleague Judge Castel who presided over the Telegram case in the Southern District of New York. He noted that Judge Castel provided two decisions in the Telegram case that specifically addressed these problems.</p>



<p>In Telegram 1, Judge Castel disagreed with Telegram&#8217;s description of security, pointing out that the security was not just the GRAM token itself but the entire scheme and set of agreements governing its sales and distribution. The Judge extended the scope of GRAM beyond mere alphanumeric code and pointed to the Howey test.</p>



<p>Judge Castel further explained in Telegram 2 that concentrating only on the early buyers and their agreements would overlook the crucial point that the &#8220;security&#8221; covered the entire scheme rather than just specific agreements. By addressing the problem of secondary market transactions, the Judge considered them a component of the broader plan. He emphasized that the GRAM Purchase Agreements and Telegram&#8217;s related understandings and commitments were part of the strategy.</p>



<p>This included the hope and aim that those making the initial purchases would sell GRAM to other people. Judge Castel remarked that the anticipated sale of GRAM through Telegram&#8217;s conduits into the secondary market would probably include American buyers and satisfy the requirements for Morrison’s transactional test.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;Morrison&#8217;s transactional test&#8221; refers to a legal test drawn from the case Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case dealt with how the American securities rules should be applied internationally.</p>



<p>Deaton admits that <em>“some could read Telegram as negative against Ripple because Judge Torres could find that Ripple’s intent was to create a secondary market for XRP, therefore, finding the secondary market was part of the ‘scheme’.”</em></p>



<p>In contrast to XRP, the GRAM token used by Telegram was not classified by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (USGAO) as a &#8220;virtual currency&#8221; in 2014. Furthermore, unlike XRP, FinCEN did not classify GRAM as a &#8220;virtual currency&#8221; in 2015. Additionally, MoneyGram did not use Gram the way it did with XRP, which included filing documentation with the SEC demonstrating XRP&#8217;s use in MoneyGram&#8217;s international business. Deaton highlights the lack of companies like Bailard Inc., which issued ethics declarations stating their intention to solely purchase and trade the three digital currencies BTC, ETH, and XRP, usually recognized by the industry as non-securities. This list does not include GRAM.</p>



<p>Deaton said: <em>“Unlike Telegram, the XRPL was fully functional, and XRP had been traded for 7.5 years openly and publicly. Unlike the GRAM token, SEC staff could own XRP up until 2019.”</em></p>



<p>As far as the SEC is concerned, according to the CryptoLawUs founder, Ripple has been engaged in an ongoing initial coin offering (ICO) for more than ten years. Every sale of XRP, regardless of the seller or circumstances, is regarded as a security by the SEC because of its purported association with “the scheme”.</p>



<p>Deaton feels that the case&#8217;s judge, Judge Torres, must examine the underlying asset and secondary market sales. The court may choose to ignore these concerns and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-crypto-lawyer-sheds-light-on-imminent-judgment-in-sec-case-as-xrp-army-awaits-verdict/">issue a judgment</a>, but doing so would be viewed as judicial activism and would contradict the SEC&#8217;s approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Binance’s founder says challenges with regulators will steel the resolve of the exchange’s employees.</li>



<li>In recent months, the exchange has come under fire over non-compliance issues with regulatory agencies, casting a shadow of doubt over its future.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite the regulatory headwinds against Binance, the exchange’s CEO Changpeng Zhao claims that camaraderie amongst employees is at its zenith as he shares the “secret” for building resilient teams.</p>



<p>On July 10, the embattled CEO took to <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1678277304307404800?s=20">Twitter</a> to reveal the formula for building a hardy team spirit in the face of mounting challenges. According to Zhao, the secret lies in the right amount of “external pressure” designed to forge a resilient culture in the workplace.</p>



<p>He pressed his point home using the analogy of an alien invasion of Earth, noting that “all the issues between the US and China would disappear in a heartbeat.” Zhao noted that fancy team-building dinners and coaching exercises may assist in building resilience but has the flaw of being only a temporary measure.</p>



<p>“While I’m not suggesting the pressure needs to be life-threatening, fighting in the trenches together is the best way to build time teams,” said Zhao. “It builds resilience, alliance, resilience and most importantly trust between the team members.”</p>



<p>Zhao added that while adversity may create internal trust, companies can foster external trust through “collaboration and cooperation,” citing Binance as an example of a resilient team.</p>



<p>Binance has been in the eye of the storm in recent weeks as the exchange, following allegations of financial impropriety by US regulators and an investigation from French authorities for aggravated money laundering. Things went from bad to worse after the exchange was forced to exit Dutch markets, and a fresh investigation from Australian officials seemed to compound Binance’s regulatory woes.</p>



<p>“If the allegations against Binance are true, they implicate very serious criminal and civil misconduct, including national-security related issues,” remarked Alex Zerden, CEO of Capital Peak Strategies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-crack-in-the-wall-for-binance"><strong>A crack in the wall for Binance</strong></h2>



<p>Despite claims of a resilient team, there appears to be a mass exit of leading executives at the exchange. Binance’’s Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of Compliance left their roles at the company with multiple reports claiming the exits were linked to a probe by the US Department of Justice.</p>



<p>However, Zhao hit back at the claims saying that the exits are normal occurrences in the lifespan of every company, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-cz-shrugs-off-news-of-senior-executive-personnel-resigning-as-attempts-to-spread-fud/">confirming</a> that Binance will “continue to hire” new staff to fill existing vacancies.</p>



<p>Early in the year, the company lost Matthew Price as its Global Head of Intelligence and Investigations, while <a href="https://zycrypto.com/brian-brooks-steps-down-as-binance-us-ceo-after-only-three-months/">Brian Brooks</a> left his role as Binance.US CEO in 2021, only three months after his appointment.</p>

<p>A handful of factors primarily determine the price movement of any cryptocurrency asset. This squally ranges from a fundamental level to a technical level. For a leading asset like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/glassnode-co-founder-optimistic-as-ethereum-reclaims-key-support-setting-stage-for-bullish-momentum/">Ethereum</a>, fundamental and technical developments have repeatedly swayed market sentiments.</p>



<p>With Ethereum (ETH) preparing to enter the third quarter of 2023, market players are curious to gain insight into the factors stimulating the asset’s continuous price growth. According to recent data from CryptoQuant, the upsurge in Ether’s price value can be traced back to DEXs. </p>



<p>Decentralized exchanges, also known as DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces allowing users to carry out transactions with other crypto traders without needing a third party.</p>



<p>The on-chain metrics platform CryptoQuant asserted that a significant portion of Ether’s bullish price performance could be tied to the rise in the number of DEX transactions carried out this year.</p>



<p><em>“Starting from 2023, when observing the volume of ETH traded on DEX, particularly the volume of transactions where ETH is swapped, we can see that it tends to move in a similar direction to the price of ETH.”</em> CryptoQuant asserted. </p>

<p>The pattern was first spotted in January 2023, CryptoQuant noted. Since then, the volume of trades involving ETH on decentralized exchanges has consistently risen. Later in March, the network recorded an enormous volume of trades after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on many <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-wants-four-months-to-make-a-recommendation-on-coinbases-call-for-crypto-clarity/">centralized exchanges</a>.</p>



<p>Although this might have been another factor that boosted the price of ETH, the volume of ETH being swapped on decentralized exchanges has been decreasing consistently since March.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s still unknown where the market is. It is still unclear whether or not Ether has peaked. As CryptoQuant asserts, “We now need to determine whether the current price of ETH will continue to adjust upwards or if the current stage signifies a bottom signal, indicating a good buying opportunity.”</p>



<p>At the time of this report, most altcoins on the market are trading in the red zone. Ether trades for $1,875 after dropping by 4.30% over the last week. Bitcoin has also not been spared by the mild downswing, as it has lost 0.45% in the last hour and more than 2% of its gains within the last 7 days. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/standard-chartered-bank-says-bitcoin-price-likely-to-hit-50000-this-year-120000-by-2024/">Bitcoin</a> now trades at a press time price of $30,610.</p>
