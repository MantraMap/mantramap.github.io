<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Google Cloud partners with Voltage for global expansion of Bitcoin-based services, signaling growing interest in cryptocurrency.</em></li>



<li><em>The collaboration aims to leverage Google Cloud&#8217;s resources and Voltage&#8217;s expertise in the Lightning Network to cater to customers&#8217; Bitcoin integration needs worldwide.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Bitcoin-Based services offered by Google Cloud are being expanded.</strong></h5>

<p>In a significant move, Google Cloud, the renowned cloud and data service provider valued at $225 billion, has joined the Bitcoin bandwagon by partnering with Voltage, an infrastructure provider specializing in the Bitcoin Lightning Network. This collaboration aims to expand Bitcoin-based services globally while supporting Voltage&#8217;s operational growth.</p>



<p>Through this partnership, Voltage will leverage Google Cloud&#8217;s vast resources to cater to its customers on a global scale. By deploying nodes in specific geographic regions, Voltage can meet the demands of larger customers seeking Bitcoin and Lightning integration, such as those in the U.K. or Asia.</p>



<p>The announcement of this collaboration has generated considerable attention on social media, signaling Google&#8217;s increasing interest and acceptance of Bitcoin and Lightning. This move sets Google apart from competitors like Apple, which recently removed a Lightning-friendly decentralized social media protocol from its App Store.</p>

<p>With<a href="https://coincu.com/184701-google-clouds-game-changing-web3-startup/"> Google Cloud</a>&#8216;s parent company Alphabet&#8217;s extensive reach, the collaboration strengthens the position of Lightning in the tech industry, particularly among payment services providers. Google Pay, with millions of users across over 15 countries, further bolsters the company&#8217;s influence in the digital payment space.</p>



<p>This partnership comes after Google Ventures (GV), the investment arm of Google, exhibited a strong interest in blockchain, Web3 companies, and Bitcoin. GV&#8217;s participation in a $6-million seed round for Voltage in 2021 reflects the growing momentum of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>While Lightning continues to gain traction worldwide, industry observers emphasize the need to monitor its growth. Notably, one of Mexico&#8217;s largest companies has started experimenting with Lightning, and major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have committed to integrating Lightning.</p>



<p>Voltage&#8217;s CEO, Graham Krizek, anticipates more services to be rolled out soon, accompanied by efforts in Bitcoin education. The partnership with Google Cloud is seen as a significant step forward, exposing organizations to the possibilities of Bitcoin and Lightning and capturing their attention amid the increasing interest and demand.</p>



<p>As the adoption of Bitcoin and Lightning progresses, it will be crucial to monitor the industry&#8217;s response and the evolving landscape of decentralized finance. The collaboration between Google Cloud and Voltage marks a notable milestone in the intersection of traditional cloud services and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On July 9, Julian Traversa tweeted that the San Francisco Superior Court had seized over Fei Protocol&#8217;s Discord channel.</strong></h5>

<p>In a recent development, the Discord channel of decentralized finance (DeFi) project Fei Protocol has been taken over by the San Francisco Superior Court, as announced by renowned crypto influencer Julian Traversa in a tweet on July 9.</p>



<p>According to court filings, Fei Labs, the company behind <a href="https://coincu.com/118826-fei-protocol-issue-hits-new-low-for-defi/">Fei Protocol</a>, is facing a class action lawsuit for alleged non-compliance with securities laws during the &#8220;Genesis Event&#8221; from March 31, 2021, to April 3, 2021. The lawsuit claims that Fei Labs failed to register the sale of Fei and TRIBE tokens, resulting in a violation of securities regulations.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>However, a settlement has been reached between the involved parties, leading to the establishment of a $17.85 million settlement fund. This fund will be utilized to compensate individuals or entities who promptly file valid proof of claims related to the class action lawsuit.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-2.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-2.jpeg" alt="Fei Protocol&#039;s Discord Channel Seized By US Court In Class Action Lawsuit Settlement" class="wp-image-201046" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-2.jpeg 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-2-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Fei Protocol&#039;s Discord Channel Seized By US Court In Class Action Lawsuit Settlement 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The takeover of Fei Protocol&#8217;s Discord channel by the San Francisco Superior Court serves as a significant development in the legal proceedings surrounding the alleged securities law violations. The court&#8217;s intervention aims to ensure proper adherence to regulatory requirements and protect the interests of affected individuals and entities.</p>



<p>Fei Protocol is a DeFi project that has garnered attention in the crypto community for its innovative approach to stablecoin issuance and decentralized governance. However, the recent class action lawsuit highlights the challenges faced by DeFi projects in navigating regulatory frameworks and compliance obligations.</p>



<p>As the settlement fund has been established, affected parties are encouraged to promptly file valid proof of claims to secure their share of the compensation. This resolution marks a step forward in addressing the legal implications faced by Fei Protocol and showcases the importance of regulatory compliance within the evolving DeFi landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>AI predicts a modest increase in Dogecoin&#8217;s price for July, forecasting it to reach $0.067 by the end of the month.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the world of digital assets, Dogecoin (DOGE) has become a prominent player and a popular meme coin.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dogecoin-a-bad-investment-expert-calls-it-terrible-but-doge-price-predictions-see-massive-surge.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="532" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dogecoin-a-bad-investment-expert-calls-it-terrible-but-doge-price-predictions-see-massive-surge.jpeg" alt="AI Predicts Dogecoin Price For July, But Market Volatility Looms" class="wp-image-201037" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dogecoin-a-bad-investment-expert-calls-it-terrible-but-doge-price-predictions-see-massive-surge.jpeg 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dogecoin-a-bad-investment-expert-calls-it-terrible-but-doge-price-predictions-see-massive-surge-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dogecoin-a-bad-investment-expert-calls-it-terrible-but-doge-price-predictions-see-massive-surge-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dogecoin-a-bad-investment-expert-calls-it-terrible-but-doge-price-predictions-see-massive-surge-750x499.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="AI Predicts Dogecoin Price For July, But Market Volatility Looms 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Now, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), PricePredictions has forecasted the price of DOGE at the end of July 2023. However, the current market conditions and volatility make predictions uncertain.</p>



<p>AI technology, utilizing technical analysis indicators such as moving average convergence divergence, suggests a modest increase in DOGE&#8217;s price. The predicted price for July 31, 2023, stands at $0.067, reflecting a 0.75% increase from the current value of $0.065.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://coincu.com/197384-dogecoin-growing-low/">Dogecoin</a> recently experienced a surge past $0.07, it was followed by a significant downturn, the largest correction seen this year. Moreover, discussions and interest surrounding DOGE have declined, as reported by Santiment.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGE_7D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="582" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGE_7D_graph_coinmarketcap-1024x582.jpeg" alt="AI Predicts Dogecoin Price For July, But Market Volatility Looms" class="wp-image-201038" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGE_7D_graph_coinmarketcap-1024x582.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGE_7D_graph_coinmarketcap-300x170.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGE_7D_graph_coinmarketcap-768x436.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGE_7D_graph_coinmarketcap-750x426.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGE_7D_graph_coinmarketcap-1140x648.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGE_7D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="AI Predicts Dogecoin Price For July, But Market Volatility Looms 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Given the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the fact that it is susceptible to unexpected price shifts, it is essential to emphasize that forecasts should only be used as points of reference. This is especially true when it comes to the world of meme currencies, which is characterized by a high degree of unpredictability.</p>



<p>Investors and traders should continue to exercise caution and keep a close eye on the market circumstances, as the price of Dogecoin can be impacted by a variety of reasons beyond those that can be predicted by AI. The path that DOGE will take in the future weeks may be influenced by factors such as fluctuations in investor sentiment and general market corrections.</p>



<p>When making decisions on investments in the unpredictable and ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape, it is vital to practice due diligence and evaluate a variety of criteria. Artificial intelligence can provide valuable insights, but investors still need to be careful.</p>

<p>Grayscale DeFi Fund currently accounts for 45.46% of each token in Uniswap (UNI), 19.04% of Lido (LDO), 11.53% of Aave (Aave), 10.82% of MakerDAO (MKR), and 10.82% of Curve Token DAO (CRV) at 7.03% and Synthetix (SNX) at 6.12%.</p>



<p>This digital asset manager said it adjusted the DeFi fund&#8217;s portfolio, selling a certain number of existing tokens by the weight of each token and using the proceeds to buy LDO.</p>



<p>&#8220;In accordance with the CoinDesk DeFi Select Index methodology, Grayscale has adjusted the DeFi Fund&#8217;s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings, and using the cash proceeds to purchase Lido (LDO),&#8221; Grayscale said in a company <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/07/2701070/0/en/Grayscale-Digital-Large-Cap-Fund-Grayscale-DeFi-Fund-and-Grayscale-Smart-Contract-Platform-Ex-Ethereum-Fund-Announce-Rebalancing-of-Funds-for-Second-Quarter-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release</a>. &#8220;No tokens were removed from the DeFi Fund.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lido, a liquid staking service, also offers tokens that aim to make staking on Ethereum cheaper. Lido staking ETH (stETH) is its most popular product and the seventh largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko.

<p>Circle, the issuer of the popular USDC stablecoin, acted quickly in response to the recent security breach on the Multichain protocol. This decisive move demonstrates Circle&#8217;s commitment to protecting the integrity and security of its stablecoins.</p>

<p>In response to the incident, Multichain took to Twitter from its official account to notify users of the temporary suspension of its services. This notice is intended to provide transparency to users and advise them to only interact with the platform once the situation is resolved.</p>

<p>Affected parties, including Circle and Multichain, are likely working hard to investigate the breach, determine the root cause, and make the necessary improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future. More than 24 hours have passed, but information about the cause of the hack has not been revealed.</p>



<p>This multi-chain bridge service has recently caused a lot of frustration for users due to incidents and negative information about the project leader. At the end of May, the bridge also stopped working for the reason that there was no access when it lost contact with CEO Zhao Jun. Meanwhile, the project&#8217;s development team and CEO are rumored to have been arrested by Chinese police before.</p>

<p>A confidential July 7 report from Teneo, the liquidation firm, which CoinDesk reviewed, says failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has a &#8220;potential claim&#8221; worth more than $1 billion with DCG and its lending subsidiary Genesis. The report also states that BlockFi has received a &#8220;preferred payment&#8221; of more than $220 million from 3AC.</p>



<p>Preference claims would come into play if the hedge fund were aware it made payments that put one or more debts into a better position than other debts. In this case, they concern transactions made by 3AC during what&#8217;s known as the insolvency twilight zone following the collapse of the Terra Luna project earlier in 2022.</p>



<p>However, with the current situation, the companies involved are all struggling and caught up in a tangle of lawsuits and complaints with different partners.</p>

<p>DCG and Genesis, along with founder Barry Silbert, are both embroiled in a lawsuit <a href="https://coincu.com/200998-dcg-has-responses-to-the-lawsuit-from-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> yesterday by Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss alleging a conspiracy to defraud Genesis creditors following claims of more than $600 million by the company. Gemini stagnates and shows no sign of being met.</p>



<p>In addition, BlockFi also filed a complaint requesting the recovery of more than $1 billion from FTX/Alameda. However, based on the filing filed by FTX, FTX does not accept BlockFi&#8217;s argument and argues that BlockFi is abusing bankruptcy rules. Accordingly, its bankruptcy plan was also opposed.</p>



<p>For now, Teneo declined to comment on any payback plans. DCG and BlockFi did not return requests for comment.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DCG has officially responded after Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss announced that he had filed a lawsuit against the company and founder Barry Silbert.</em></li>



<li><em>Silbert&#8217;s company denied Gemini&#8217;s accusations and argued that CEO Winklevoss was trying to deny responsibility for the Earn program.</em></li>



<li><em>A protracted lawsuit could break out with $1.2 billion of user funds still in storage.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DCG has issued an <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1677346741409173508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official response</a> to the lawsuit filed by Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss with disapproval of all allegations.</strong></h5>

<p>The back-and-forth between DCG and its &#8220;close&#8221; partner Gemini has been intense since its subsidiary, lending platform Genesis, filed for bankruptcy at the end of January this year. Genesis and Gemini have a partnership through Gemini&#8217;s Earn program, and the bankruptcy left $1.2 billion in Gemini user funds trapped on the platform.</p>



<p>In response to a recent lawsuit, Silbert&#8217;s company has denied Gemini&#8217;s allegations and said that this is just an advertising ploy by Gemini CEO to escape responsibility from the Earn program and $1.2 billion in user money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In addition, DCG also denies all allegations that the company and its employees have any wrongdoing and considers these allegations to be unfounded defamation. This company attempted to negotiate a settlement for Genesis&#8217; bankruptcy, while Gemini was not actively involved in the process. Neither Cameron nor Tyler Winklevoss has appeared in any recent face-to-face meetings.</p>



<p>The development is nothing new, but the fact that both companies are blaming each other could lead to a protracted lawsuit. User money still needs to be included while the two sides try to push and give.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous post, on July 7, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss tweeted that Gemini <a href="https://coincu.com/200982-gemini-files-lawsuit-dcg-for-fraud-conspiracy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had filed</a> a lawsuit against DCG and founder Barry Silbert. Winklevoss alleges that Barry was not only the mastermind and mastermind of the DCG and Genesis creditor scam but that he was directly and personally involved in this scam.</p>

<p>Besides, Winklevoss said it was a complicated lie, with DCG not taking losses and not providing actual capital. Barry, DCG, and Genesis conspired to fabricate false financial statements to hide the truth from Gemini and its creditors.</p>

<p>Kennedy&#8217;s support for the king of crypto has been notable throughout his campaign, and he has gone as far as accepting the digital asset for campaign donations. However, the news of his substantial BTC holdings has led to questions about his objectivity in policymaking, particularly related to the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Kennedy has expressed concerns about government-issued digital assets, but his personal financial interest in Bitcoin could be seen as a potential conflict of interest.</p>



<p>It is unclear when Kennedy acquired the Bitcoin holdings, and the filing does not specify whether the investment was made by Kennedy himself or a member of his family. The lack of transparency has only added to the concerns raised by this news, highlighting the importance of transparency in political campaigns and policymaking. As the digital asset industry continues to gain mainstream attention and influence, it is crucial that policymakers approach it with an informed and objective perspective.</p>



<p>The news also emphasizes the need for a clear and concise regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry, ensuring that candidates and policymakers alike can operate with clarity and transparency. As the industry becomes more prevalent in the political sphere, policymakers must take a proactive approach to regulation, working to create a fair and level playing field for all participants.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gemini has sued DCG and Barry Silbert for a fraud conspiracy against Genesis creditors. DCG calls it a &#8220;publicity stunt&#8221;. Mediation process is ending.</strong></h5>



<p>Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has sued Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its founder Barry Silbert. Gemini alleges that Silbert and DCG were involved in fraud against creditors of Genesis, a cryptocurrency lending platform that filed for bankruptcy last year. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to the complaint, Silbert and DCG conspired with Genesis to create false financial reports to hide the fact that Genesis was insolvent. DCG responded to the lawsuit by calling it a &#8220;publicity stunt&#8221; by Cameron Winklevoss to deflect blame from himself and Gemini. The mediation process is coming to an end, and the case is expected to be handled under Chapter 11 bankruptcy law.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>This is yet another publicity stunt from Cameron Winklevoss to deflect blame and responsibility from himself and Gemini, which operated the Gemini Earn program. Any suggestion of wrongdoing by DCG or any of its employees is baseless, defamatory, and completely false. From day one, DCG has remained committed to reaching an amicable solution for all parties to the Genesis bankruptcy. </em><br><br><em>Senior DCG leadership has been working around the clock over the course of multiple months in active negotiation with representatives of the Official Unsecured Creditors Committee and Ad Hoc Committee to reach a deal while Gemini&#8217;s leadership was MIA or only issuing press statements. To be clear, neither Cameron nor Tyler Winklevoss have been involved in any of the recent in-person meetings. The mediation process is nearing a close and we expect to bring the Genesis Chapter 11 case to a conclusion soon.</em></p>

<p>Gemini claims that Silbert and DCG were involved in a carefully crafted fraud against creditors of Genesis. When Genesis notified Gemini that it would terminate the Earn program in October 2022, Silbert reached out to set up a meeting to induce Gemini to continue to Earn. He did this knowing that Genesis was massively insolvent. Silbert claimed that Genesis faced only a timing issue, but this was a lie that hid the gaping hole in Genesis’s balance sheet.</p>

<p>When Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collapsed in June 2022, it blew a $1.2 billion hole in Genesis’s balance sheet. Instead of coming clean, Genesis claimed that everything was business as usual because DCG had stepped in to absorb the losses. However, DCG did not absorb any losses or provide real capital. Behind the scenes, DCG wrote Genesis a sham 10-year promissory note with a measly 1% interest rate – worth just a fraction of its $1.1 billion face amount. Genesis was wildly insolvent.</p>

<p>The fraud extends to the very top, with Silbert and other DCG executives directly involved in these lies and concealing the truth from Gemini and other creditors. According to Cameron Winklevoss, Mark Murphy, then-COO of DCG (and current President), was copied when Genesis disseminated its fake financial reports.
