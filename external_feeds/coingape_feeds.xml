As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain mainstream acceptance, Camron’s remarks have sparked intense speculation and interest among investors and enthusiasts alike.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Great Accumulation of bitcoin has begun. Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast. If bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this…</p>
<p>&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1671525634131066881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><b>Comparing Bitcoin with Past Performances</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cameron draws a comparison between the previous decade, during which Bitcoin emerged as the most obvious and best investment, and the current decade, which presents an opportunity for what he believes could be the most obvious and best trade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the speculative likelihood of the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, Cameron emphasizes that the accessibility of Bitcoin is set to expand, potentially transforming the market. The Gemini boss claims that investors recognizing the limited window for pre-IPO investments may view this as a favorable opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin before broader adoption occurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In recent times, big players in traditional finance including BlackRock, </span><a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-invesco-refiles-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-after-two-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Invesco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://coingape.com/fidelity-investments-reportedly-filing-blackrock-type-spot-bitcoin-etf-acquire-grayscale/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Fidelity Investments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-shoots-7-as-wisdom-tree-files-bitcoin-etf/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wisdom Tree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> have filed for the spot Bitcoin ETF application, boosting investor confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remarkably, Cameron’s remarks were motivated by Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price spike, which saw it reach $30,000 for the first time since April. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin was </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/"><span style="font-weight: 400">trading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> at $30,213.97 with a price increase of 6.5% in the past 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Cameron has earlier </span><a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/cameron-winklevoss-predicts-crypto-bull-run-soon/"><span style="font-weight: 400">predicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a shift in focus from the US to the East when it comes to the next significant crypto bull run due to heightened regulatory requirements.</span></p>
<h2><b>Factors Fueling the Bitcoin’s Price Surge</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin&#8217;s price surge followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments acknowledging the role of payment stablecoins as a form of money. Additionally, Powell also expressed the view that the central bank should play a role in approving the issuance of stablecoins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Simultaneously, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee signaled its intent to vote on new legislation in July aimed at providing greater clarity for digital assets. The proposed legislation seeks to establish a clearer regulatory framework, facilitating the transition of digital assets from a security status to a commodity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, Bitcoin&#8217;s latest price breakthrough also corresponded with a huge rise in network activity, as evidenced by an increase in its transaction volume.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Dogecoin Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falling channel pattern governs the current downtrend in the DOGE price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish reversal from the pattern’s trend set this memecoin on a new recovery track</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $333.9 Million, indicating a 108% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/k/KbC3pwzk.png" alt="Dogecoin price" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the Dogecoin price shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">falling channel pattern</a>. Amid the early June sell-off, the coin price plunged to this pattern’s support trendline and rebound as the accumulation from buyers rose.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, over the past seven months, the DOGE price bounced back thrice from this support and each reversal triggered a significant recovery. Thus, the recent reversal on June 10th hints at the beginning of a new bull cycle within the pattern.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, with a 4.2% price jump, the buyers breach the nearest significant resistance of $0.063. This breakout offers the first signal to recovery and could potentially reach the $0.095 mark with sustained buying.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Dogecoin Price Reach $0.075?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the $0.0632 resistance flips this barrier into viable support. If today, the DOGE price closed the daily candle above the $0.0632 flipped support, the buyers could set on this level to climb higher. While the ideal target for this pattern remains at $0.095, the buyers could face in-between resistance at $0.075, followed by $0.083.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOGE price surged above the 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> after two months giving an extra edge to long traders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and the signal(Orange) gives additional confirmation for a bullish upswing.</span></li>

<h2><b>Polygon Copilot Caters to All User Levels</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The beta launch was </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1671504505764970498" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on Twitter earlier today by Polygon Labs. Polygon Copilot, as it is referred to, is an AI-powered guide trained on all public Polygon (MATIC) documentation and general Web3.0 content. With all of this information, it is able to offer important insights, analytics, and guidance across different aspects of the ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is specifically powered by Layer-E, a start-up focused on Web3 content monetization and OpenAI ChatGPT which was released a couple of months ago. Users can get information across several domains like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Decentralized Applications (DApps), gaming, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and social networks via this tool, especially during an onboarding process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is designed in such a way that makes it easier for users to navigate whether they are serious builders, an enthusiast, or just a curious user. Also, it can effectively cater for the informational needs of all users, whether basic or advanced features, all that is required from the user is &#8220;asking&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To make it easier for users to ask questions, Polygon created a section for sample ChatGPT prompts. </span></p>
<h2><b>More Pronounced Utilities</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, it stores past chats to enable users to keep track of their conversation. However, the history is only available to users who connect their MetaMask account to the Polygon Copilot. The Polygon Copilot is a conversational AI that offers different personas for various users which have been carefully curated into three groups; beginners, advanced and degens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the blockchain platform, the Polygon Copilot was conceived as a tool which will handle the complexities of the crypto sector in the zero-knowledge era &#8220;ZK&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In the era of ZK-powered scaling, navigating the vast ecosystem of dApps #onPolygon can become a challenge without a handy guide. Polygon Copilot, currently in Beta, provides quick responses, personalized onboarding experiences, code snippets, valuable insights, and analytics,&#8221; Polygon Labs tweeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This release comes barely a day after Polygon&#8217;s engineering team </span><a href="https://coingape.com/polygon-pushes-for-pos-conversion-to-zkevm-validium-l2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a proposal to upgrade Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) sidechain to a Layer-2 network secured by Ethereum (ETH) known as ‘zkEVM Validium’ in line with the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/polygon-2-0-released-as-the-value-layer-of-the-internet-matic-price-up-2-5/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Polygon. 2.0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> vision.</span></p>

The S2F model which he created can be applied to all investment assets but PlanB is particularly interested in Bitcoin (BTC) which he is </span><a href="https://coingape.com/planb-when-will-bitcoin-btc-price-cross-500k/"><span style="font-weight: 400">optimistic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is destined to soar beyond $100,000 in the near term.</span></p>
<h2><b>PlanB on Plausible Investor Motivation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The renowned market analysts was curious to know whether or not ‘they’ which can mean investors or market bulls are “front running the halving.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Are they front running the halving .. ? <a href="https://t.co/dFP77yZUER">pic.twitter.com/dFP77yZUER</a></p>
<p>&mdash; PlanB (@100trillionUSD) <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1671522442748080128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frontrunning is a word in investing that depicts the deep motivation to buy an asset based on a knowledge one has that might fuel the valuation of such asset in the long run. Bitcoin’s halving which PlanB is referring to is a network event that takes place automatically every four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://coingape.com/btc-price-29k-1-year-countdown-bitcoin-halving/"><span style="font-weight: 400">next halving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is not expected until April next year, a time when the rewards issued to miners of Bitcoin will be sliced by half from the current 6.25 BTC. The halving event has been known to be succeeded by a period of immense price growth and investors typically stack up on the digital currency on the grounds that its price will surge in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PlanB’s questions come on the heels of the ongoing recovery in the broader digital currency ecosystem which has pushed Bitcoin&#8217;s price to retest its key resistance level and currently changing hands at a spot price of $29,877.91, up by more than 11% over the past 24 hours. The resurgence in BTC has fueled a corresponding rally that is pushing altcoins to new pedestals.</span></p>
<h2><b>Question for Smart Money Investors</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are different sentiments supporting the current Bitcoin price growth which has seen smart investors pump new funds into the premier digital currency. While investors are possibly all out for the crypto market following a wave of spot Bitcoin ETF filings </span><a href="https://coingape.com/will-blackrock-win-the-first-bitcoin-etf-approval-here-are-the-odds/"><span style="font-weight: 400">sparked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by BlackRock, the inherent potential of the forthcoming halving can also be a big boost to bet big on BTC at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin touched its All-Time High (ATH) months after its last halving back in May 2020. With expectations of similar growth ahead, we may see additional smart money inflows into the market in the weeks and months ahead.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Binance Coin Daily Chart </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ascending triangle pattern reflects a gradual growth in underlying bullish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher price rejection candles at the $253 level indicate the BNB price faces overhead supply pressure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the BNB coin is $389.5 Million, indicating an 11.2% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/i/Ii9giy3q.png" alt="Binance Coin Price" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly two weeks, the BNB price resonated in a narrow range spread from the $253 to $220 mark. However, as large asset management companies showed their interest in the <a href="https://coingape.com/wisdomtree-files-for-bitcoin-etf/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a>, the crypt market witnessed a positive sentiment building among investors.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, a closer look at the lower time frame chart revealed the upswing in BNB price as the formation of an <a href="https://coingape.com/education/ascending-triangle/#:~:text=The%20ascending%20triangle%20develops%20when,cryptocurrency%20candlesticks%20begins%20to%20solidify.&amp;text=The%20technical%20analysis%20as%20several,trading%2C%20technical%20analysis%20is%20crucial.">ascending triangle pattern</a>. This bullish continuation pattern triggers a significant upswing upon the breakout of its neckline resistance.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the BNB price trades at $246.8 with an intraday loss of 0.32%. Under the influence of this pattern, the buyers could pierce the $0.253 neckline and simultaneously reclaim the aforementioned trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential breakout will intensify the buying pressure and may surge the prices back to $300.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Binance Coin Price Plunge to $220?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the long-term trend for Binance coins remains bearish, the prices have a high possibility to break the lower trendline of an ascending triangle. This breakdown will signal the resumption of the previous downtrend and could plunge the coin price to $220, followed by $200.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> moving close to $253 may strengthen the resistance power of this level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) slope could increase buying orders into the market.</span></li>

<h2><b>Binance in Kazakhstan: Dividends of Relationship With Authorities</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As announced by Binance, the launch of its trading platform in Kazakhstan came following the receipt of the permanent license from the AIFC Financial Services Authority (AFSA) last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Binance Chief Executive Officer Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao led a visitation to the country’s President Kassym-Jomart Kemeluly Tokayev back in October last year. The visit saw the organization and the Kazakhstan government </span><a href="https://coingape.com/binance-mou-kazakhstan/"><span style="font-weight: 400">sign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to help foster digital innovation in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The newly launched exchange can be dubbed the dividends of the association and the exchange’s prospective users in the country can now trade crypto with government-issued certainty. The trading platform will be focused on exchange and conversion services, deposit and withdrawal of fiat, and custody of crypto assets. According to Binance, the suite of services will be expanded in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Over the past year, regulators in Kazakhstan have taken significant steps towards the development of the cryptocurrency industry,” said Asset Turysov, Vice Minister of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry of Kazakhstan, “Binance has provided assistance to Kazakhstan in the development of a legislative framework and a general policy for the regulation of crypto assets, as well as in the implementation of various educational initiatives, including for government and law enforcement agencies and regulators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides Turysov, different industry leaders have hailed the newly launched trading platform as a reference point for more to come in the future.</span></p>
<h2><b>Taking Complementary Win</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Binance Exchange has seen more struggles this month than any other thus far this year. The exchange is </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-us-sec-sues-crypto-giant-binance-and-ceo-cz/"><span style="font-weight: 400">currently embroiled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in a regulatory drag by both the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reports have it that the trading platform is under investigation on either side of the Atlantic based on the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/european-countries-co-investigating-binance-alongside-us-sec/"><span style="font-weight: 400">collaboration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> between regulators in each region. The exchange’s outfit in Kazakhstan can be tagged a major win at a time when it has had to close shop in both Cyprus and the United Kingdom.</span></p>

<h2>Voyager Withdrawal Will Lead To A Crypto Rug Pull?</h2>
<p>On-Chain data of the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://etherscan.io/tokentxns?a=0x500a746c9a44f68fe6aa86a92e7b3af4f322ae66&amp;p=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wallet address</a> 0x500a746c9a44f68fe6aa86a92e7b3af4f322ae66 associated with Voyager depicts massive altcoin transfers. It should be noted that the creditors can withdraw about 35% of their crypto holdings with Voyager between June 20 and July 5, 2023.</p>
<p>The trouble crypto firm moved around 350 billion <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shiba-inu-shib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu</a> coins (approx worth $2.6 million) in multiple transactions. However, the biggest transaction recorded turns out to be of moving 70 Billion SHIB (approx worth $537k) from the hot wallet. SHIB is trading at an average price of $0.0000073, at the press time.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second biggest meme crypto price</a> is up by around 7% in the past 7 days. However, it is expected the upcoming Voyager Users’ withdrawal can increase the selling pressure for Shiba Inu Coin.</p>

<h2>Selling Pressure To Surge Ahead?</h2>
<p>Voyager linked wallet then moved 279.79k Polygon (MATIC) tokens (approx worth $180k) in a single transaction. However, the crypto firm moved a minor amount of MATIC tokens before this mega transaction.</p>
<p>MATIC’s 7% price surge in the last 24 hours has managed to provide it relief from the recent downward trend. Meanwhile, a price drop is expected ahead as Voyager users seek to recover their funds.</p>
<p>As per the June 14, 2023 court filings, Paul Hage, Voyager’s bankruptcy plan administrator stated that around June 15 Voyager app will show the amount available for user withdrawals. However, after 30 days, clients will be allowed to withdraw crypto assets via the app or can ask for a cash payout.</p>

<h2><b>XRP Price Daily Chart:</b></h2>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new higher low formation at the $0.4558 mark reflects buyers&#8217; continues to accumulate at price dips</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the $0.487 resistance offer buyers an entry opportunity with a potential upswing of 11%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.2 Billion, indicating a 34% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/TrGGESUK.png" alt="XRP Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning the long-coming support trendline and $0.55 horizontal level, the XRP price shows the formation of an <a href="https://coingape.com/education/ascending-triangle/#:~:text=The%20ascending%20triangle%20develops%20when,cryptocurrency%20candlesticks%20begins%20to%20solidify.&amp;text=The%20technical%20analysis%20as%20several,trading%2C%20technical%20analysis%20is%20crucial.">ascending triangle pattern</a> in the daily chart. Under the influence of this pattern, the asset price developing new higher lows indicates gradual growth in underlying bullish momentum.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent growth in the crypto market, the XRP price has rebounded from the support trendline and set a new bull cycle within the pattern. As of now, the prices are wavering above the recently reclaimed $0.487 horizontal trying to obtain suitable support.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buyers could sustain this level, the altcoin’s market value would rise 11% to hit the $0.55 barrier.</span></p>
<h2><b>Is XRP Price Ready to Surpass $0.55?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the development of an ascending triangle pattern, the XRP price is poised to hit the $0.55 barrier. However, a breakout above this barrier is less likely in the near term as buyers need more aggression to overcome this multi-month ceiling. Anyhow, as more trading days pass by, the coin price is likely to resonate and coil narrow within the triangle which may eventually break the $0.55 resistance.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Average Directional Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADX slope shows no upswing to the recent price surge indicating the buyers currently lack the strength to trigger an aggressive rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upper band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger band indicator</a> wavering flat near the $0.55 level increases the resistance strength of this barrier.</span></li>

This move aims to provide Kava&#8217;s community with access to the world&#8217;s first, most trusted, and widely used stablecoin.</p>
<h2>USDT Now Available on Kava</h2>
<p>Tether announced in its blog that U.S. dollar-pegged <a href="https://coingape.com/price/tether/">Tether tokens (“USDT”)</a> will be launched on Kava, known for its scalability and speed. Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer at Tether, expressed excitement about the partnership, stating,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to be launching USD₮ on Kava, offering its strong community access to the world&#8217;s first, most stable, most trusted, and most widely used stablecoin.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ardoino also highlighted the Kava network&#8217;s impressive track record of four years with zero security issues, emphasizing the importance of protecting USDT users. Tether&#8217;s decision to launch on the Kava platform further strengthens its position as the leading stablecoin in the market.</p>
<p>Kava announced last month about its “Kava 13” mainnet update, upgrading its infrastructure to offer users greater security, scalability, functionality, and speed.</p>
<h3>How Stable is Stablecoin?</h3>
<p>Tether has been at the forefront of the stablecoin concept, and its tokens are already live on various networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, EOS, Liquid Network, Omni, and Tron.</p>
<p>Recently, Bloomberg <a href="https://coingape.com/chinese-securities-once-backed-the-worlds-largest-stablecoin-usdt-bloomberg/">reported</a> that Tether Holdings Ltd., the issuer of USDT, reportedly once held securities issued by Chinese companies as part of its reserves. Last week, CoinGape reported <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-usdt-depegs-again-as-whales-dump-largest-stablecoin/">USDT dominance within the Curve 3pool</a>, the liquidity pool for stablecoins. The unusual influx of USDT has triggered concerns about the stablecoin’s stability and also led of whales selling off significant amount of USDT tokens, leading to a slight depeg.</p>
<p>CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/is-tether-usdt-following-terras-ust-in-losing-its-dollar-peg/">reported</a> on May 12, 2022, that the token is down 4.8% to 0.9508- its lowest level since the 2017 crypto crash. USDT has the largest market cap of $83 billion and has noticed a significant surge in its trading volume in last 24 hours. Compared to yesterday, the volume has gained 76.45%, reaching $35 billion.</p>

This move comes after Invesco initially filed for a Bitcoin ETF in collaboration with Galaxy Digital in 2021, as CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/364-billion-etf-manager-invesco-files-for-bitcoin-strategy-etf/amp/">reported</a>.</p>
<h2>Invesco Refiles Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>Invesco has reportedly tossed its hat back into the ring for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152370" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/21133310/20230621_131016.png" alt="" width="1406" height="640" /></p>
<p>After their initial application in 2021, Invesco also applied for Bitcoin Futures ETF bid but pulled off at the last moment. They <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-why-invesco-pulled-out-of-bitcoin-btc-futures-etf-last-minute/">cited</a> regularly concerns after the SEC has already approved ProShares’s Bitcoin Futures ETF.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/wisdomtree-files-for-bitcoin-etf/">Wisdom Tree Files for BTC ETF</a></strong></p>
<p>In its recent filing, Invesco emphasized the urgent need for a spot Bitcoin ETF, asserting that the absence of such a product drives investors toward riskier alternatives. The filing referred to instances of insolvencies involving platforms like FTX, Celsius Network, BlockFi, and Voyager Digital Holdings.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin ETF On The Rise</h3>
<p>The reapplication by Invesco for a spot Bitcoin ETF comes in response to growing interest and competition in the cryptocurrency ETF space. Invesco&#8217;s decision to reapply was likely influenced by the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-to-be-reality-soon/">recent application submitted by BlackRock</a>, a significant player in the investment management industry.</p>
<p>Other prominent names, such as iShares and Bitwise, and WisdomTree, have also submitted filings for spot Bitcoin ETFs since last Thursday.</p>
<p>Coingape also <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-shoots-7-as-wisdom-tree-files-bitcoin-etf/">reported</a> Bitcoin Price that experienced a significant surge in its price over the past 24 hours, with a 6.9% increase. In the last seven days, it has seen a notable rise of 10.6%. According to Tradingview, Bitcoin&#8217;s market value has reached 51%, indicating its dominance in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the identification of a significant number of altcoins as securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have implications for the market.</p>
<p>In contrast, Bitcoin, being recognized as a commodity by the SEC, may be viewed as a more established and regulated investment option.</p>

The 4.8% gain in 24 hours coincides with a market-wide recovery led by the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-shoots-7-as-wisdom-tree-files-bitcoin-etf/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most prominent crypto, Bitcoin</a>. BTC surged by more than 7%, breaching $29,000 resistance in the wake of last week’s sell-off below $25,000.</p>
<p>The largest smart contacts token, currently trading at $1,815, is on the verge of validating a spike above $2,000 for the first time since early May.</p>
<p>Crypto markets are flipping substantially bullish this week as investors reconsider the potential short-term gains that can be tapped following the Federal Reserve decision on interest rates.</p>
<p>The regulator paused interest rate hikes, a move that is expected to bolster risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, <a href="https://coingape.com/blackrock-choses-coinbase-custody-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec-lawsuit-ending-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blackrock’s spot Bitcoin ETF application</a> has continued to buoy the crypto market.</p>
<p>As reported this week, more institutional investors are entering the crypto market with different products. For instance, <a href="https://coingape.com/fidelity-investments-reportedly-filing-blackrock-type-spot-bitcoin-etf-acquire-grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidelity Investments backed EDX Markets</a> launched on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It is a crypto exchange platform catering to the needs of brokers and investors who hope to avoid messy business operations such as those that led to the implosion of FTX.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Upholds Bullish Outlook as Buy Signals Flash</h2>
<p>Ethereum price now sits above the applied moving averages, starting with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,728, the 100-day EMA at $1,785, and the 50-day EMA at $1,806.</p>
<p>The bullish outlook, which started to form immediately after the most recent dip to $1,625, is now a heartbeat away from closing the gap to $2,000. Meanwhile, a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, is ready to bolster the expected move above $2,000.</p>

<p>Based on the position of the Money Flow Index (MFI), the trend reversal can be attributed to an <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-key-events-to-impact-bitcoin-ethereum-price-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influx of funds into ETH markets</a>. The MFI is moving toward the midline after sliding to 27 on Monday.</p>
<p>If buyers heed the call to buy Ether from the MACD, the liquidity backing this trend reversal would be enhanced. A daily close above two key levels would be essential for Ethereum price to validate the rally.</p>
<p>First, bulls must strive to keep ETH above the 50-day EMA and the 100-day. Secondly, short-term support at $1,800 is imperative for the ongoing $2,000-bound price action.</p>
<p>That said, new long positions in ETH may have to wait until <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-price-likely-to-get-a-boost-with-new-developer-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum has validated</a> the above conditions. To a large extent, such validations would help traders avoid bull traps that may lead to sudden pullbacks.</p>
<p>Key support areas to watch out for in the event of a trend correction below $1,800 include the 200-day EMA (purple) at $1,728 and the potential support highlighted along the ascending trendline.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin halving set to occur in less than ten months, analysts like Michaël van de Poppe are urging investors to consider buying altcoins like Ethereum. Halving is the event that slashes BTC miner rewards, thus reducing supply to keep inflation at a minimum.</p>

<p>Ten months prior to the halving is the best moment.</p>
<p>This cycle is the big one.</p>
<p>Accumulate.</p>
<p>— Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1671230631500447745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Halving events have also been associated with the onset of the bull market. As supply and demand dynamics change, <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-confirms-breakout-to-30000-is-this-the-start-of-the-bull-market/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price begins to rally</a> while pulling the entire crypto market up with it.</p>
<p>Buying Ethereum and other altcoins at this time could give investors a golden chance to capitalize on the expected bull market in 2024 going into 2025.</p>

<h2>SEC To Drop Clarity On Crypto Rules?</h2>
<p>As per the court’s order, a further report needed to submit by the U.S SEC in the next 120 days or on October 11, 2023. This comes after the <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-sec-case-news-crypto-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commission denied to reply</a> to the Coinbase’s filed request and asked the court to provide them with additional time.</p>
<p>Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase stated that a report on basic crypto rules is due in the next 120 days by the US SEC. He stated that they are grateful that the court will keep on shining a light on an SEC process that is till now being operated in darkness.</p>
<p>He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1671272363869220864" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a> that the recent order by the Circuit deserves praise for upholding the basic idea that the SEC is accountable under the law, too. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read Coinbase News Here&#8230;</strong></a><br />

<h2>Coinbase Gets A Upper Hand?</h2>
<p>It is being suggested as good news for Coinbase in a fight to get clarity on crypto rules. As the Third Circuit ordered the SEC to update the court on whether it decides to grant the petition or not. However, If the Commission states to say that it hasn’t decided to make a move in the additional time provide then a ruling can land in the Coinbase’s favor.</p>
<p>If this happens then the court will have to issue the writ of mandamus and the commission will need to reply with “Yes” or “No”.</p>

<h2>MAS Proposes Common Standard For Digital Currency</h2>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore on June 21 published a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/pbm/pbm-technical-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whitepaper</a> on Purpose Bound Money (PBM), proposing a common standard for use of digital money as big banks and investors continues to bet on digital asset transfers and trading despite intense scrutiny from regulators.</p>
<p>The whitepaper proposes a common protocol to specify conditions for the use of digital money such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenised bank deposits, and stablecoins on a distributed ledger. It details the concept of Purpose Bound Money (PBM), enabling senders specify conditions from validity period to shops when making digital money transactions.</p>
<p>The paper is part of Project Orchid, a collaboration between the MAS and industry partners to build the foundational<br />
digital infrastructure and platforms for digital currency use cases. It outlines PBM lifecycle from issuance to redemption, as well as the protocol to interface with digital currencies supporting it.</p>
<p>The PBM protocol can work with miltiple ledger technologies and forms of money, enabling users to access digital money using their preferred digital wallets and transfer digital assets.</p>

<h2>Collaboration With Industry Partners</h2>
<p>Top companies and financial giants are launching trials to test the Purpose Bound Money, making sending money and trading digital assets more efficient.</p>
<p>Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer, MAS, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This collaboration among industry players and policymakers has helped achieve important advances in settlement efficiency, merchant acquisition, and user experience with the use of digital money. More importantly, it has enhanced the prospects for digital money becoming a key component of the future financial and payments landscape.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Companies such as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, FAZZ and Grab are collaborating on a pilot use case for online retail payments. Escrow arrangements are designed to allow payment to be released only when the customer receives the purchased items. Moreover, the use of PBM for cashback and other incentives to improve consumer experiences is also planned.</p>

CZ took to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1671295082920591366?s=20">Twitter</a>, sharing a screenshot of a Wall Street Journal article about the exchange and commenting on its impeccable timing.</p>
<h2>CZ Binance Supports New Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>Binance CEO CZ tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Impeccable timing. But the more the merrier.</p></blockquote>
<p>Applauding developments in times of regulatory scrutinies, he believes more competition in the crypto space is a positive thing. Clearly as a crypto exchange CEO, he is not threatened by emerging players due to its broader vision.</p>
<p>Though CZ Binance has <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-ceo-says-he-is-pleased-the-sec-disagreement-is-over/">expressed</a> relief over SEC disagreement settlement, SEC is still wary of crypto developments in the US. New Exchange EDX, a &#8220;noncustodial&#8221; platform. is set to offer trading exclusively in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) initially.</p>
<p>The company plans to launch a clearing house later this year to settle trades. According to the Wall Street Journal, even after the clearing house is operational, EDX intends to rely on third-party banks and a crypto custodian to hold customer assets.</p>
<h3>Timing Matters In Crypto World</h3>
<p>This move comes as both Binance, including CZ Binance and <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/">Coinbase</a> face legal action from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulatory scrutiny surrounding crypto exchanges has been primarily driven by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler&#8217;s assertion that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities falling under the agency&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/binance-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More About SEC v. Binance Lawsuit</a></strong></p>
<p>Recently, SEC Chair spoke about the need to protect investors, saying the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto markets</a> should not be allowed to harm them.</p>
<p>In addition to the backing from prominent US firms Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments, EDX recently concluded a funding round with investors such as Miami International Holdings, DV Crypto, GTS, GSR Markets LTD, and HRT Technology.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, June 20, the share price of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: GBTC) shot up by a staggering 11.40% ending the trading at $16.85. The surge in the GBTC share price came as it recorded the highest trading volume of $10.24 million, since November 22 last year.</p>
<p>Citing data from CryptoQuant, popular crypto journalist Colin Wu <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1671328483493154816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>: &#8220;GBTC has rallied more than 25% since BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF like GBTC application. CryptoQuant shows that the current GBTC premium is -34.19%, the second highest point this year&#8221;.</p>
<p>The recent activity surge in GBTC comes as some of the top financial players have been applying for a spot-Bitcoin ETF. As we know, Grayscale has been one of the forerunners in the race of bringing a spot Bitcoin ETF to the market.</p>
<p>BlackRock submitted their application at the same time that Grayscale Investments is having a legal dispute with the SEC to change the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF backed by physical assets. The discount between the trust&#8217;s value and its net asset value has significantly reduced, as there is speculation that BlackRock&#8217;s action might strengthen Grayscale&#8217;s argument.</p>
<h3>Will BlackRock&#8217;s Market Entry Impact Grayscale?</h3>
<p>Grayscale is one of the world&#8217;s largest digital asset managers, however, the entry of giants like BlackRock could possibly threaten its stronghold in the market. Asset manager Grayscale has been suing the US SEC in order to upgrade its trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles to Grayscale could be the hefty fee that it charges to traders. According to data from The Block Research, the company generated over $230 million from its main GBTC and ETHE products since the start of the year. However, the annual fees of 2.0% and 2.5% that the company charges for managing those assets may decrease if BlackRock is able to launch a competing product successfully, as suggested by James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence.</p>
