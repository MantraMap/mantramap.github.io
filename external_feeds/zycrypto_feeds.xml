<ul>
<li>This week, BTC, ETH, ADA, and other top assets record massive surges following institutional demands for digital assets.</li>



<li>The price of Bitcoin moved past $31,000 for the first time in one year, hitting $31,300 temporarily before a slight correction. </li>



<li>Market bulls are relishing the present status quo as the total market capitalization tops $1.2 trillion after weekly gains.</li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market has made a huge recovery since the start of the year following a turbulent 2022 that saw top coins lose nearly 60% of their market capitalization.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins remain in the green zone <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">recording</a> huge wins in the market over the past seven days. Bitcoin has surged over 4% in the last 24 hours, pushing up its weekly gains above 20% thanks to a renewed institutional rush.</p>



<p>Trading at $17,000 at the start of the year, the market leader has made an astronomical 87.1% year-to-date (YTD) increase and a 46% 12-month rise. Trading above $31,000, BTC has hit a 12-month high after it slipped from that benchmark in May 2022. This week, BTC also reclaimed its 50% market share after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hit Coinbase with a lawsuit over offering trading services to several altcoins it described as securities.</p>



<p>Bitcoin Cash, a Bitcoin spin-off, has skyrocketed over 30% to become the best-performing asset in the past 24 hours. The entire digital asset market cap now stands at $1.23 trillion after a daily 2.34% rise. Although there is a slight resistance, Bitcoin bulls have refused to cede grounds to bears after reports that ETFs will not be approved or declined until early next year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altcoins-led-by-eth-follow-btcs-steps"><strong>Altcoins led by ETH follow BTCs steps</strong></h2>



<p>The ripple effect of Bitcoin’s performance can be seen across the market as several altcoins post weekly gains of over 20%. Ethereum trades at $1,904 at press time after a seven-day gain of 10.9%. ETH is way above its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $1,804, with bulls signalling a $2,000 target. </p>



<p>Cardano (ADA) exchanges hands at $0.299, increasing this week by 12.98%. Similarly, Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Polkadot (DOT) have spiked 19.6%, 11.17%, 15.19%, and 15.02% in the last seven days. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has led the meme coin weekly rally, recording over 18% this week. Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin rose 10% in the same timeframe. </p>



<p>The bullish outlook in the market was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-investors-sentiment-for-crypto-surges-following-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-filing/">sparked</a> by BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF followed by similar applications for top firms and the launch of a digital asset exchange, EDX, backed by big Wall Street firms.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin options contracts worth over $3.3 billion exchanged hands within 24 hours across major crypto exchanges. </li>



<li>Analysts on Deribit describe it as the largest trading volume recorded in three months as the price of the asset nears a two-month high.&nbsp;</li>



<li>On the flip side, Bitcoin bears suggest that the surging price will cool as the BTC spot ETF will not be approved in the short term.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The surging prices in the digital asset market are visible as several sectors are recording growth not seen in months. Derivatives trading among top assets will continue to rise with recent trends, according to market pundits.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) trading above $30,000 has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-taps-30k-bears-record-highest-short-squeeze-of-the-month-with-bulls-pushing-for-35000/">sparked</a> demand for the asset in the options market with surging bullish bets for two straight days. The boosted activity in the market comes as the BTC nears its two-month high following renewed institutional demand sparked off by BlackRock&#8217;s ETF filing.</p>



<p>Over the past 24 hours, BTC option contracts worth a little over $3.3 billion have been traded across many derivatives exchanges. The figure marks the highest daily performance of BTC options in three months. Popular options exchange Deribit stated that there’s more room for growth after it recorded 80% of the total volume.</p>



<p>“<em>We have seen the biggest trading volume in three months. There is a lot of interest in buying call options,&#8221; </em>Lin Chen Deribits Asia’s business personnel said. In the past week, call spreads have made up 45% of total block flows. Patrick Chu, the director for institutional sales at Paradigm explained that surging price has led to call overwriters reducing risk by buying back the bullish exposure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Mostly, people have been buying back the topside, especially option overwriters given the rapid upward move,&#8221; </em>he noted.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-demand-raises-the-bullish-index"><strong>High demand raises the bullish index</strong></h2>



<p>The activities of traditional finance (TradFi) players have set the tone for an <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-investors-sentiment-for-crypto-surges-following-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-filing/">uphill</a> climb in the prices of digital assets. The push for a spot BTC ETF among major financial market players has led to a scramble between retail and institutional investors for the asset driving up major index ratings.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index has moved into the greed zone at 65 with bulls keen on more price surges to mark a good run in Q2 2023. In the derivatives market, Deribit’s Bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) measures the 30-day volatility of the asset. According to Amberdata, the DVOL stands at 59.24 the biggest recorded since April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chen commented that the DVOL index was pushed up as a result of rising prices and a “<em>the increased demand for options.”</em></p>

<p>Indonesia&#8217;s markets regulator has declared Cardano&#8217;s native token ADA as a commodity, signalling a significant milestone in the global cryptocurrency arena.</p>



<p>Through an amendment to the country’s former Trade Controlling Agency Regulations Commodity Futures Number 11 of 2022, on June 9, Bappebti, the agency responsible for regulating commodity futures trading in Indonesia, classified over 450 cryptocurrencies, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-reveals-exciting-vision-for-cardano-ada-this-summer/">Cardano (ADA)</a> as commodities, allowing them to be traded within established regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>According to the document’s preamble, extensive evaluations were conducted before listing the cryptocurrencies, considering utility, functionality, and intrinsic value within their respective blockchain ecosystems. By subjecting these cryptocurrencies to such scrutiny, Bappebti noted that it aimed to provide clarity and investor protection while promoting innovation and technological advancement in the cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>Notably, the regulator recognized ADA&#8217;s value, given its utility and pivotal role within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Cardano&#8217;s ADA token holds significance within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem due to its utility and functionality. It plays a crucial role in facilitating transactions, staking, and participating in the governance of the network.</p>



<p>However, Bappebti&#8217;s decision to classify these cryptocurrencies as commodities stand in stark contrast to the perspective of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has predominantly categorized ADA and other cryptocurrencies primarily as securities, a stance that was reaffirmed in its recent case against Binance.US, drawing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-community-mount-offensive-against-the-u-s-sec-for-naming-ada-a-security/">criticism</a> from the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>That said, the Indonesian government&#8217;s classification of ADA and other cryptocurrencies as commodities reflects a potential powershift in the cryptocurrency landscape, with countries like Indonesia and China embracing and recognizing cryptocurrencies as tradable assets.</p>



<p>Although the West, particularly the United States, has traditionally played a dominant role in shaping technological advancements, experts in the industry have asserted that the East&#8217;s forward-thinking regulatory frameworks and embrace of technological innovation may position these countries at the forefront of the next technological revolution, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-risks-losing-global-technology-leadership-role-to-china-due-to-restrictive-crypto-policies-coinbase-ceo/">leaving the US behind</a>.</p>



<p>Already, amidst the regulatory crackdowns on US cryptocurrency companies, industry leaders like Coinbase and Gemini have begun looking elsewhere. Recently, Coinbase entered Bermuda, while Gemini seeks a license in the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Bittrex ceased operations in the US in April, saying the US regulatory environment was “not viable” for business.</p>



<p>The Indonesian government&#8217;s recognition of ADA as a commodity also opens up possibilities for neighbouring countries to reconsider their regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. Observing the success and acceptance of ADA in Indonesia, these countries may likewise adopt a commodity-based approach to cryptocurrencies, fostering regulatory clarity, innovation, and investment.</p>

<p>Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democrat, came out swinging on behalf of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Bitcoin</a> on Thursday while criticizing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Kennedy, a member of one of the most famous U.S. political families, believes CBDCs pose a risk of oppressive control and are likely to be misused.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-friend-of-bitcoin"><strong>A Friend Of Bitcoin&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has shared his opinion on cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (AI), among other things, in his latest interview.</p>



<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/22/robert-f-kennedy-jr-interview-why-im-not-an-anti-vaxxer/">Speaking to</a> <em>The New York Pos</em>t on June 22, Kennedy — an environmental lawyer, son of former U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew to United States’ 35th president John F. Kennedy and former Sen. Ted Kennedy — outlined planned crypto policies he would introduce if he took office.</p>



<p>“I will make sure that we have policies that support Bitcoin and the freedom to transact and that allow individuals to manage their own Bitcoin wallets, nodes, and passwords,” Kennedy stated.</p>



<p>The candidate indicated that he would support a permissive regulatory environment in the United States that “only allow the narrowest controls that are necessary to prevent money laundering.”</p>



<p>Kennedy, who officially announced his 2024 presidential bid on April 19, grabbed the headlines last month when he <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1653808786577010697">lambasted </a>President Joe Biden’s proposal for an excise duty that would charge cryptocurrency miners in the U.S. 30% of their energy costs — a move that cited the environmental and societal harm caused by crypto mining operations.</p>



<p>Moreover, he told attendees during a May 19 keynote speech at the Bitcoin Miami Conference that he would accept donations for his presidential campaign in bitcoin — which will essentially make him the first presidential candidate in US history to accept campaign donations in the flagship cryptocurrency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Foe Of CBDCs</strong></h2>



<p>During the interview with <em>The New York Post</em>, Kennedy also weighed in on the debate over CBDCs, saying such government-backed tokens are “instruments of control and oppression, and are certain to be abused.”</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, CBDCs are digital forms of national fiat currencies, which a country’s central bank issues. The United States Federal Reserve has not yet announced plans to roll out a digital dollar. However, presidential candidates in 2024’s U.S. election, like Kennedy, are already sounding an alarm.</p>



<p>Kennedy’s staunch anti-CBDC view echoes that of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Republican U.S. presidential candidate earlier this year proposed a law to ban the use of CBDCs as money within Florida.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears to be adopting a more measured approach towards cryptocurrencies as the digital assets landscape evolves.</p>



<p>In a blog post published Thursday, June 22, the global lender discussed the potential effectiveness of banning crypto assets calling for a more receptive approach to managing them. Delving into Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, the lender highlighted the progress made by countries such as Bahamas, Brazil and Jamaica, stating that LAC countries are leading the way in crypto adoption, with several nations introducing CBDCs to enhance financial inclusion, strengthening payment systems, and reducing cross-border remittance costs.</p>



<p>According to the lender, their potential benefits fueled the demand for crypto assets, including protection against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/zimbabwe-defies-imf-directive-to-sell-millions-of-gold-backed-crypto-assets-terms-it-a-success/">economic instability</a> and improved financial inclusion. However, despite this growth, the lender warned that adopting crypto assets also comes with challenges and risks stating that countries with a history of instability, low institutional credibility, corruption, and extensive informal sectors face particular risks.</p>



<p>The blog went on to point out the risks associated with adopting crypto assets, such as Bitcoin, even when supported by the government, as, in its opinion,  their acceptance as a medium of exchange may not be widespread.</p>



<p><em>“El Salvador’s experience with Bitcoin suggests there are risks to adopting unbacked crypto assets—those that rely on supply and demand rather than on any asset for value and that are subject to significant price volatility—even when explicitly supported by the government,” </em><a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/06/22/cf-interest-in-cb-digital-currencies-picks-up-in-latam-the-caribbean-while-crypto-use-varies">said</a> the IMF.</p>



<p>Despite the outlined risks, the lender acknowledged the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and emphasized the importance of tailored regulation and policy frameworks to manage risks effectively.</p>



<p><em>“While a few countries have completely banned crypto assets given their risks, this approach may not be effective in the long run. The region should instead focus on addressing the drivers of crypto demand, including citizens’ unmet digital payment needs, and on improving transparency, by recording crypto asset transactions in national statistics,” </em>it added.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>IMF&#8217;s recent blog builds upon its previous work on effective policies for crypto assets. In a February guidance report,&nbsp; the lender addressed member countries on the importance of an appropriate policy response to crypto assets arguing that “<em>doing nothing is untenable as crypto assets may continue to evolve”</em> despite the recent industry headwinds.</p>



<p>That said, IMF&#8217;s evolving stance on crypto assets, considering its past concerns about crypto assets, especially after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvador-ignores-imf-set-to-open-second-bitcoin-embassy-in-the-us/">El Salvador’s</a> move to make Bitcoin legal tender, reflects its recognition of the importance of tailored regulation and policy frameworks for the sector. This shift indicates progress for the industry as a whole.</p>

<ul>
<li>The price of Bitcoin has surpassed $31,000 for the second time this year, with experts predicting a higher push should institutional investors maintain their current pace.</li>



<li>The latest surge comes as Tradfi players flood into the digital asset market, setting up exchanges and filing ETFs.</li>



<li>BTC drags the rest of the market up as altcoins recover lost ground following the SEC sting on Binance and Coinbase.</li>
</ul>



<p>Institutional investors have triggered another bull run in the market, as predicted by bulls at the start of the year. How long will Wall Street’s thirst last for what they term the “digital gold?”</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has hit another milestone this month after it soars past the $30,000 level for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">second</a> time this year. The last time BTC was at $30,000 was in April and has since suffered a rough patch since then as a result of harsh regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), leading to surging outflows.</p>



<p>The dark days of the market leader look behind it as recent wins have wiped away its losses. On Wednesday, BTC hit $28,000, a milestone it has remained shy of since May and has moved uphill. The market leader has recorded a 16.5% growth in the past week and a 7% increase in the last 24 hours to shoot past $30,000.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC trades at $31,117, with experts predicting further strength to stamp its reclaim of over 50% of the market capitalization. At the start of the year, BTC was valued at $16,615 but has rallied over 80% in the past six months. Altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano have also surged 5.67% and 6.87%, respectively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tradfi-goes-hungry-btc-goes-up"><strong>Tradfi goes hungry, BTC goes up</strong></h2>



<p>Traditional finance has been instrumental to the rise in the market, with several firms investing in diverse products. The whole phase kicked off when BlackRock, the largest asset management firm, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-investors-sentiment-for-crypto-surges-following-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filed</a> for a Bitcoin ETF, a move that the SEC has consistently rejected previous applicants.</p>



<p>Following the footsteps of BlackRock, Wisdom Tree and Invesco also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Apart from this, a significant entrant by institutional investors was the launch of EDX, a digital asset exchange backed by several giants on Wall Street, including Fidelity Investments, Citadel Securities, and Charles Schwab. Deutsche Bank has also applied for a cryptocurrency custody license in Germany.</p>



<p>Ruslan Lienkha, YouHodler’s chief of markets, stated that the market will be structured by big firms in the future, adding that “<em>more investors will have access to crypto investments with much lower risks. Important to notice that a very small percentage of BlackRock or Fidelity clients interested in spot BTC ETFs are enough to move the price further north.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-and-sec-align-on-hinman-emails-as-case-takes-interesting-turn/">Ripple</a>, made key revelations regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a rare video address, providing light on what he believes to be a purposeful effort to stifle innovation in the crypto space and control through enforcement. The documents associated with the notorious 2018 Hinman speech, which covered the standards for establishing if a token is a security, were recently unsealed, prompting the Chief Executive to make his remarks.</p>



<p>Highlighting the contents of the unsealed documents, Garlinghouse stated, <em>&#8220;At best, these documents show that senior officials at the SEC couldn&#8217;t agree on the law and told Bill Hinman directly he would confuse the public even more about the rules for crypto. At worst, they show that Hinman deliberately ignored the law and tried to create new laws, something only Congress can do.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Garlinghouse further emphasized that while the SEC put on a front of openness and direction, the findings were not limited to any token or blockchain and instead served as proof of the agency&#8217;s tenacious pursuit of enforcement actions against the sector. He mentioned Ripple&#8217;s aggressive interaction with the SEC, including private meetings with Jay Clayton and Bill Hinman, during which no objections to the token <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-joins-the-ranks-of-licensed-payment-institutions-in-singapore-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-its-conclusion/">XRP</a> being categorized as a security were voiced.</p>



<p>&#8220;We were fully transparent, not knowing they would then use this information against us,&#8221; Ripple’s CEO said in the Video message. He criticized the unexpected SEC Wells notification, citing violations of the Securities and Exchange Act without offering details and reiterating the experiences of others who had faced similar legal procedures.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse alleged that the SEC tried discouraging American crypto innovation by pointing out the regulatory body&#8217;s purported contradictions and ambiguities. He called out the current SEC chair as an unelected bureaucrat. He accused the SEC of utilizing the lack of regulatory clarity to seize control of the whole cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The SEC tried to bully us into acquiescing,&#8221; Garlinghouse stated. &#8220;Thankfully we have had the resources to fight back, and now we can all see what they&#8217;ve fought so hard to hide. They knowingly created confusion about the rules and used that confusion to regulate through enforcement. That&#8217;s bad faith, plain and simple.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The Ripple CEO noted that there is still much to be done in the struggle for regulatory clarity as the SEC&#8217;s action against Ripple approaches its conclusion. He expressed his gratitude to those who supported Ripple throughout the process, including his co-workers, friends, family, and the larger XRP community.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s approach to cryptocurrency has been the subject of increased debate since Garlinghouse&#8217;s discoveries, which have also called into question the agency&#8217;s transparency and regulatory aims. The need for transparent legislation and an environment that fosters innovation is still at the forefront of the continuing discussion as the crypto community waits for new developments.</p>

<p>The race to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States is heating up, with a new filing submitted in the past 24 hours. Crypto asset manager Valkyrie Digital Assets has also moved to file for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the wake of Invesco, WisdomTree, and BlackRock making similar applications recently. In the June 21 filing, Valkyrie revealed that it would seek to list its fund on the Nasdaq exchange under the clever ticker “BRRR”. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-valkyrie-refiles-for-physically-backed-bitcoin-etf-with-sec"><strong>Valkyrie Refiles For Physically Backed Bitcoin ETF With SEC</strong></h2>



<p>Valkyrie, which already offers a Bitcoin Strategy ETF and a Bitcoin Miners ETF, updated its filing for the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund on Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The company’s filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713123007682/valkyrie-s1a_062123.htm#valkyries1aa018">states </a>that “the Trust will hold bitcoin and will value its Shares daily based on the value of bitcoin as reflected by the Index, which is an independently calculated value based on an aggregation of executed trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anddd we have anotha one! Most interesting here with this updated Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund prospectus &#8212; they have changed their exchange to Nasdaq (same as BlackRock) anddd they gave us a ticker <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BRRR&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BRRR</a>. <a href="https://t.co/3QxeFRfLPy">pic.twitter.com/3QxeFRfLPy</a></p>&mdash; James Seyffart (@JSeyff) <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1671599801761161235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The firm says the ETF will hold bitcoin to reflect the price of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate &#8211; New York Variant (BRRNY), a figure estimated based on trading data collected across a number of leading bitcoin exchanges, including Coinbase, Bitstamp, Gemini, itBit, Kraken, and LMAX Digital. The filing notes that BRRNY is the exact figure that Bitcoin futures contracts are settled on, which trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>



<p>Valkyrie’s fund ticker BRRR is known within the crypto community as the sweet, sweet sound made by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s money printer.</p>



<p>In its previous filing in January 2021, Valkyrie had proposed its fund be listed on NYSE Arca. But with the new prospectus, the firm is now looking at the Nasdaq.</p>



<p>The move comes after BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management firm, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">applied for a spot ETF</a> last week — a move that shook up the market. Another comically large financial services firm Invesco <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shoots-up-with-30000-in-sight-following-fresh-wave-of-spot-etf-applications/">refiled </a>for a spot bitcoin product on Tuesday. The less-comically large U.S.-based asset manager WisdomTree, also reapplied for permission to offer a physically-backed bitcoin ETF, after getting rejected by the SEC in 2022.</p>



<p>So far, the SEC hasn’t indicated when it plans to make an announcement regarding a bitcoin ETF. In fact, Grayscale has even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">sued </a>the SEC over its denied bitcoin spot ETF. While the SEC has rejected all previous spot bitcoin ETF applications, market onlookers are liking BlackRock&#8217;s chances given its reputation and track record with the regulator.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Resurgence</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto prices have punched higher in the wake of BlackRock’s bid to establish the first spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The top cryptocurrency has rocketed by over 20% to cross the $30,000 mark for the first time since April.</p>



<p>Bitcoin was lagging at the start of the year when it was changing hands at only $16,615 per coin. It&#8217;s now up over 80% since the beginning of 2023, suggesting big investors are feeling bullish about the dominant cryptocurrency — and the rest of the crypto market in general.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, BTC is still well below its $69,044.77 all-time high registered in November 2021.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the board of directors of Alibaba Group Holding Limited made a significant announcement regarding the company&#8217;s management. In a press release via Business Wire, the Company noted that current Executive Vice Chairman Joseph C. Tsai will follow Daniel Zhang as Chairman of the Alibaba Group. Mr Zhang will step down as CEO and be replaced by Eddie Yongming Wu, Chairman of Taobao and Tmall Group, on the board of directors. The new leadership will take over on September 10, 2023.</p>



<p>Daniel Zhang, the outgoing Chairman and CEO, expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to lead Alibaba Group over the past years. Zhang stated, <em>&#8220;It has been an incredible honor and privilege to lead Alibaba Group as CEO over the past eight years and Chairman over the past four years. This is the right time for me to make a transition, given the importance of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group as it progresses towards a full spin-off. I look forward to working closely with Joe and Eddie in the coming months to ensure a seamless transition.&#8221;</em> Zhang will continue to lead Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group as its Chairman and CEO.</p>



<p>Regarding the leadership change, Joseph Tsai acknowledged Daniel Zhang&#8217;s exceptional contributions to the company. Tsai said, <em>&#8220;Daniel has made exceptional contributions to the development of Alibaba Group since joining the company in 2007, and he demonstrated extraordinary leadership in navigating unprecedented uncertainties affecting our business over the past few years. We believe there is no better leader than Daniel to steer Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group into the next chapter of its journey and future growth.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Eddie Yongming Wu, who will assume the role of CEO, expressed his gratitude for the trust placed in him by the board of directors. Wu stated, <em>&#8220;I am grateful for the trust of the Alibaba Group board of directors and am honored to succeed Daniel as Alibaba&#8217;s CEO. Over the past 24 years, Alibaba has consistently innovated through evolution and breakthroughs from within, and each transformation has catalyzed new growth. While our current transformation brings in a new corporate organizational and governance structure, Alibaba&#8217;s mission remains unchanged.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Wu, an Alibaba co-founder and part of the Alibaba Partnership, has a strong history in technology and executive leadership inside the business. He was Alibaba&#8217;s first technical director when it was founded in 1999, and he has since held several important positions, including chief technology officer of Taobao and Alipay. Alibaba&#8217;s success is mainly due to Wu&#8217;s experience and skill in guiding technology platforms and strategic direction.</p>



<p>The leadership transition at Alibaba Group represents the organization&#8217;s dedication to sustained development, innovation, and adjustment to the changing business environment. In September 2023, the new leadership will officially take over, beginning a new era for the Alibaba Group under the direction of Chairman Joseph Tsai and CEO Eddie Yongming Wu.</p>

<p>San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-vs-ripple-hinman-documents-release-is-a-boost-to-ethereum-jpmorgan-analysts-share-opinion/">Ripple</a> has gained in-principal approval from the top financial regulator in Singapore.</p>



<p>The in-principal approval is for a Major Payments Institution License from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The permission is for Ripple to offer digital asset payments and token products in the nation, the company said in a June 21<a href="https://ripple.com/ripple-press/ripple-obtains-in-principle-regulatory-approval-in-singapore/"> press release</a>.</p>



<p>“Singapore is a leading global financial center and a prominent gateway to business in Asia Pacific,” Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse posited. “We’re incredibly proud to receive an in-principle license from the MAS, reaffirming our commitment to the region and ongoing proactive engagement with regulators globally.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re honored to obtain In-Principle Approval of a Major Payments Institution License from the <a href="https://twitter.com/MAS_sg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MAS_sg</a> – allowing us to offer regulated digital asset products and services, and scale customer use of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ODL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ODL</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1f8-1f1ec.png" alt="🇸🇬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br><br>Learn more: <a href="https://t.co/8Ylc3lZSeg">https://t.co/8Ylc3lZSeg</a></p>&mdash; Ripple (@Ripple) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple/status/1671702598414467072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The approval places Ripple’s Singapore branch, Ripple Markets Asia Pacific, in a stronger position to further expand its customers’ use of the XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which saw a 5X growth in the republic year-on-year.</p>



<p>Ripple has been operating its Asia-Pacific headquarters out of Singapore since 2017. In a separate <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-deepens-roots-in-apac-by-obtaining-in-principle-regulatory-approval-in-singapore/?utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=twitter">announcement</a>, Ripple revealed that it had managed to double the number of employees at the Singapore base, totalling 50 full-time staff.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-ceo-hails-singapore-as-global-leader-on-crypto-regulation"><strong>Ripple CEO Hails Singapore As “Global Leader” On Crypto Regulation</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking on approval from MAS, Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty observed that Singapore’s “early leadership” is setting an example for other countries aiming to create a “clear taxonomy and licensing framework.”</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that Ripple is the latest company to obtain a license for digital payment token services in Singapore in June. <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-obtains-major-payment-institution-licence-from-monetary-authority-of-singapore">Crypto.com</a> and <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/circle-singapore-obtained-major-payment-institution-license">Circle </a>received their Major Payment Institution (MPI) licenses earlier this month.</p>



<p>Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse also commended the Singaporean regulator on Thursday, noting that it was “a global leader in establishing clear rules of the road to recognize the innovation and real-world utility of digital assets”.</p>



<p>Although Ripple’s compliance journey in Singapore has been rather easy without legal hurdles, this has not been the case back home in the U.S. The fintech firm has been enmeshed in a courtroom war with the Securities and Exchange (SEC) since late 2020 after the commission filed a suit against them for selling the XRP cryptocurrency via an unregistered securities offering. The case is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-expects-final-decision-in-weeks/">expected </a>to come to a conclusion in the coming weeks — if not <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-sec-director-says-judgment-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-to-come-within-days-xrp-to-10/">days</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>BlackRock’s BTC ETF is strengthening investor confidence in the market after consecutive weeks of outflows.</li>



<li>Outflows slowed down drastically from $88 million in the past week to $5 million this week after the news of the ETF.</li>



<li>In another development, Bitcoin has regained over 50% of its market dominance for the first time in two years.</li>
</ul>



<p>If BlackRock’s ETF becomes the real deal, it could cause a new shift for the market, which has suffered regulatory hurdles and plunging values in recent weeks, observers say.</p>



<p>A new report from CoinShares shows that the massive outflows from the digital asset market are cooling down gradually after the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock ETF filing</a> last week. According to CoinShares, this week marks the ninth consecutive week of outflows after a good run in Q1 2023. In the past nine weeks, the withdrawals for mutual funds, exchange-traded products, and over-the-counter (OTC) trusts have surpassed $423 million.</p>



<p>This week has witnessed a huge turn, with investor confidence rising, as seen by reduced outflows. Investors have withdrawn $5.1 million this week against $88 million the previous week, with other indices also pointing to growing positive sentiments.</p>



<p>CoinShares points to the ETF filing as a major determinant of the boost in investor confidence. On Friday, inflows of $5 million were tracked across several products. James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, noted that these inflows were not enough to offset the previous outflows, but it shows strong signs of progress.</p>



<p>“<em>The end of the week saw minor inflows following the news that one of the world’s largest asset managers has applied for Bitcoin ETP in the U.S., although these inflows were not enough to offset outflows seen earlier in the week.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altcoins-lead-outflows-in-the-united-states"><strong>Altcoins lead outflows in the United States</strong></h2>



<p>Since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-roots-for-binance-amid-secs-motion-to-freeze-binance-us-assets/">launched</a> its renewed offensive on digital assets, altcoins have taken the most heat. This has led to plunging values of most assets as they were alleged to be securities by the SEC.</p>



<p>According to the report, products tracking the price of Ethereum recorded outflows of $5 million this past week. Other assets, including Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC), also posted massive losses after being described as securities in the Coinbase lawsuit. While Ripple (XRP) gained 4.7% in the last 30 days, ADA and MATIC plummeted 17% and 29%, respectively.</p>



<p>US investors accounted for $3.7 million worth of deposits last week despite the crackdown. Also, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has surged following the news of BlackRock’s filing and accounts for 85% of weekly inflows. </p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin has surged over 8% to break through the $30,000 level for the first time since May, with bulls keeping pressure on the pedal.</li>



<li>BlackRock’s ETF filing is critical to the uphill climb alongside the launch of Wall Street-backed exchange EDX.</li>



<li>The major rally has seen Bitcoin bears lose $36.6 million in the past 24 hours, the month&#8217;s highest short squeeze.</li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market is back in the green as more institutional investors eye top assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The latest surge has raised the market cap by 5% to $1.17 trillion.</p>



<p>The price of BTC has spiked above $30,000 in the last 24 hours, surging above 7.8% and exchanges hands for $30,038 at press time. This is the first time the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is rising above the $30k resistance after it slipped through in May according to CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>The uphill climb of BTC is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-triggers-massive-btc-accumulation/">fueled</a> by the spot BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) filing by asset management firm BlackRock. After the filing, Bitcoin reclaimed its 50% market dominance for the first time in two years, setting the tone for institutional interest in the asset. The filing initially saw BTC trade above 12% to gain lost ground following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The lawsuit led to a sharp decline in many altcoins, but the ripple effect of the BTC ETF filing can be seen in the prices of other assets. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has increased 4.95% to trade above $1,800 after slipping last week. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin are also up by 7.79%, 5.4%, and 3.61%, respectively. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-institutional-investors-light-the-path-for-bulls"><strong>Institutional investors light the path for bulls</strong></h2>



<p>A key factor in the recent surge is the renewed appetite of institutional investors to get their hands on more digital assets. BlackRock is the largest asset management firm, and the filing of the BTC ETF has sparked new institutional confidence in the market.</p>



<p>Although the SEC has consistently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-hurdles-against-btc-spot-etf-highly-suspicious-chamber-of-digital-commerce-warns/">refused</a> a spot ETF application, including those from 21Shares and ARK, the application by BlackRock came as a lifeline for BTC bulls amid damaging regulatory moves by the Commission. Also, the emergence of EDX, a digital asset exchange backed by several Wall Street firms, including Fidelity Investments, Citadel Securities, and Charles Schwab heightened the uphill run of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>As more institutional investors become attracted to crypto assets, several observers feel the SEC will tone down its aggressive regulatory stance. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiasts have received the news of EDX with great optimism as healthy competition will strengthen the market.</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysts at JPMorgan believe that the recently released Hinman documents will benefit Ethereum in the long run.</li>



<li>The financial institution states that the documents would see other altcoins become more like Ethereum to dodge the regulator&#8217;s hammer.</li>



<li>The price of altcoins has taken a major hit, with many top assets losing up to 20% since the recent regulatory push by the SEC. </li>
</ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple may have ripple effects on the entire market before the final determination of the case.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-demands-investigation-into-former-sec-director-hinman-and-his-controversial-speech/">release</a> of the documents associated with popular former SEC director William Hinman has been described as a turning point in the case for SEC. Still, right now, it could affect other assets, with Ethereum standing as the biggest gainer. Experts at JPMorgan have stated in a recent report that the released documents will trigger a more decentralized market with Ethereum used as a model.</p>



<p>The whole controversy was sparked via an email from Hinman in 2018 which stated that ether was not a security. According to the report, top figures at the SEC did not regard ether as a security in 2018, as they noted that the “<em>fact that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities creates a regulatory gap.” </em></p>



<p>Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote that the Howey Test was used to draw up those conclusions by the Commission. The hallmark of the Howey Test is that an asset will be classified as a security if there is an investment capital in a common enterprise with the reasonable expectation of profits.</p>



<p><em>“The speech acknowledges that there is another category. It is not a security because there is no controlling group yet there may be a need for regulation to protect purchasers.”</em> Panigirtzoglou commented on the Commission&#8217;s position.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-regulation-is-long-overdue">New regulation is long overdue</h2>



<p>The report by the Wall Street giant points to the fact that a new regulation is needed to balance the regulatory uncertainty opened by the Hinman documents. The Commission&#8217;s stance explains why it has not charged Ethereum while going after several <a href="https://zycrypto.com/this-is-an-opportunity-to-get-rule-clarity-in-court-coinbase-stresses-on-the-positive-amid-sec-lawsuit/">altcoins</a> this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>The Hinman documents are likely to influence the direction of the current U.S. congressional effort to regulate the crypto industry in a way that ether would avoid being designated as a security,” </em>JP Morgan wrote.</p>



<p>According to the firm, a new category could be created, which will comprise Ethereum and other altcoins that are decentralized to a certain level to avoid being termed securities. Alternatively, Congress can step in and categorize Ethereum with Bitcoin, which the Commission&#8217;s chairman Gary Gensler has hinted is not a security. This will place Ethereum and Bitcoin under the oversight jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>

<p>Among what appears to be much internal division at the SEC, Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seem to be on the same page regarding the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-prominent-securities-attorney-on-why-the-released-hinman-emails-are-a-huge-nothingburger/">Hinman Emails</a>, a set of documents that have sparked intense debate in the ongoing legal battle between the two parties.</p>



<p>The emails, which shed light on the SEC&#8217;s internal discussions about the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies, have been the subject of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-demands-investigation-into-former-sec-director-hinman-and-his-controversial-speech/">much scrutiny and speculation</a>. While some expected the emails to impact the SEC&#8217;s crypto policy significantly, their influence may be more limited than initially thought.</p>



<p>The Hinman Emails&#8217; revelation that the SEC had previously been unsure about Ethereum&#8217;s (ETH) legal standing never resulted in any official commission-approved rules or guidelines. This implies that the agency&#8217;s earlier statements, such as those made by William Hinman, the former director of the SEC&#8217;s corporation finance division, may not be as authoritative as formal regulatory rulings. As a result, the emails may have a more subtle effect on the SEC&#8217;s crypto policy than many may have hoped.</p>



<p>Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty nevertheless jumped on Twitter to comment: <em>“It’s been 5 years since Bill Hinman gave his infamous speech – and through the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple (and 7 court orders), we can finally share what happened behind the scenes through the now public emails/drafts of the speech.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emails offer a glimpse into the SEC&#8217;s internal conversations but do not have the same legal standing as established rules or standards. Ripple&#8217;s legal team has used the lack of official regulations governing the status of cryptocurrencies to argue that the SEC&#8217;s case against them is based on a false premise. The SEC and Ripple agreeing that the Hinman Emails had no impact may support Ripple&#8217;s claim that the agency&#8217;s enforcement efforts are unclear and inconsistent.</p>



<p>The emails show SEC internal discussions but don&#8217;t offer a clear position on how cryptocurrencies should be regulated. Different parties may interpret the emails and their consequences, and the court will eventually decide whether or not they are relevant to the ongoing case.</p>



<p>One can question the SEC&#8217;s motives and argue that the agency&#8217;s actions might be influenced by things other than clear regulations, such as safeguarding the interests of conventional financial institutions. The emails have intensified the existing discussion about how the SEC regulates the cryptocurrency market and raised questions about its consistency and potential effects on innovation.</p>



<p>While the alignment between Ripple and the SEC on the limited significance of the Hinman Emails may not bring about a dramatic shift in the agency&#8217;s crypto policy, it adds an interesting dimension to the legal battle between the two parties. Even if the emails reveal the SEC&#8217;s internal deliberations, they could not carry the same legal weight or have the same impact as some had wished.</p>



<p>The current legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC has already triggered discussions regarding the broader consequences for the cryptocurrency sector. The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-google-bard-ai-predicts-outcome-of-sec-case-major-win-for-ripple-imminent/">outcome of this lawsuit</a> and the way the court interprets the Hinman Emails may have significant repercussions for the regulatory environment. The court&#8217;s ruling will greatly influence future cryptocurrency regulatory guidelines in the Ripple case. It&#8217;s also likely that other legislative and regulatory organizations will be influenced by the conclusion and change how they operate.</p>
