<ul>
<li>Reports have made rounds concerning Nigeria’s decision to allow Bitcoin as a payment solution.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hopes for the change in government policy hinged on the proposed amendment to the Investment and Securities Act 2007.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Nigerian crypto enthusiasts say they need their government to back digital assets for good as it will, in turn, push up the eNaira. </li>
</ul>



<p>Africa’s most populous country, Nigeria, may be next in line to consider bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal tender in 2023 as it prepares a law to recognize digital assets.</p>



<p>Babangida Ibrahim, the House of Representatives Committee Chairman on Capital Markets, said in an interview that the law which will recognize digital assets is being pushed to keep up with “<em>recent global practices.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Like I said earlier during the second reading, we need an efficient and vibrant capital market in Nigeria. For us to do that, we have to be up to date with global practices.”</em></p>



<p>The hopes of recognizing Bitcoin rests on the proposed Investment and Securities Act which will empower the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to “<em>recognize digital assets and funds as capital for investments.” </em>The landmark legislation would also set clear-cut roles of administrative bodies in the country regarding digital assets.</p>



<p>The roles of the Central Bank and the SEC have clashed in several jurisdictions regarding the control of virtual currencies. In Nigeria, users called out the Central Bank after it placed a ban on cryptocurrencies and exchanges last year, saying it has encroached into the territory of the SEC.</p>



<p>The proposed law comes as the new <a href="https://zycrypto.com/nigerias-cbdc-launch-all-the-sides-of-the-coin/">e-naira&#8217;s</a> poor adoption makes rounds. The country’s Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) has only recorded a meagre 0.5% a year after its launch, with many blaming the government’s indecisive policies regarding the state of blockchain and virtual currencies.</p>



<h2 id="h-nigeria-s-policy-holding-a-potential-mass-adoption"><strong>Nigeria’s policy holding a potential mass adoption</strong></h2>



<p>With a population of over 200 million people, Nigeria has an edge in terms of potential blockchain and web3 projects as investors can leverage the growing population. Despite this advantage, most projects cited in Africa have gone to neighbouring countries due to the government’s mixed blockchain policies. </p>



<p>In 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a statement prohibiting the activities of digital asset exchanges in the country as well as other cryptocurrency activities. The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/nigerias-minister-urges-the-government-to-embrace-cryptocurrencies-after-stringent-bans/">ban</a> was far-reaching as it compelled banks to close accounts related to cryptocurrencies. Despite all this, Nigeria’s potential for digital asset adoption remains intact as the 11th-highest crypto market in 2022.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ripple&#8217;s XRP price has been consolidating as investors await a court decision in the case with the SEC.</li>



<li>Lawyer John Deaton expects the lawsuit&#8217;s outcome to delay until April or May.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP traded at $0.33 Monday, below a crucial resistance of $0.4, according to data provided by CoinMarketCap. Bears have been rejecting a break above $0.4, but bulls are struggling to avoid a possible drop. As Ripple&#8217;s case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission drags, the tug of war is because of an uncertain landscape.</p>



<p>Investors were increasingly growing, hoping December could become a monumental moment for Ripple. The filing of the summary judgment briefs on November 30 <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-whales-are-super-bullish-on-xrp-as-the-ripple-vs-sec-case-nears-long-awaited-end/">heightened the expectations</a>. On December 2, the parties in the lawsuit met to discuss redactions of the court filings. Subsequently, the summary judgments became public on December 5, raising speculations that the case was ending. Since Ripple had previously made milestone wins, investors expected the case could end &#8220;anytime&#8221; from December 5.</p>



<p>Most recently, Cardano&#8217;s co-founder Charles Hoskinson <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-gleeful-as-rumors-of-secs-lawsuit-against-ripple-wrapping-up-next-week-swirl/">hinted</a> at December 15 as the day the decision could arrive. In an AMA session, the blockchain entrepreneur said, &#8220;<em>(he had) heard rumors that the Ripple case will be settled December 15<sup>th</sup>. Let’s just see. That could have catastrophic implications for the industry, one way or the other.</em>&#8220;</p>



<h2 id="h-ripple-s-case-with-sec-to-be-settled-in-april-or-may-pro-xrp-lawyer-says"><strong>Ripple’s case with SEC to be settled in April or May, pro-XRP lawyer says</strong></h2>



<p>As it stands, Ripple enthusiasts remain in the dark as the date for settlement is contested. XRP supporter and lawyer John Deaton says the outcome could wait until April or early May. Deaton was responding to a question at the RealVision Crypto briefing about whether a March 31<sup>st</sup> settlement date was possible.</p>



<p>According to Deaton, March 31 would be the earliest date based on the fact that there are numerous pages of documents for the court to scrutinize before the final judgment. The lawyer said that there are 17 amicus briefs filed, making a too-early settlement difficult.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-case-outcome-mean-for-xrp"><strong>What&#8217;s the case outcome mean for XRP</strong></h2>



<p>XRP&#8217;s recent price actions show investors are eager to receive the verdict. The recent consolidation implies that traders are cautious, as any negative outcome could cause a price decline.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, XRP bulls remain on standby should the case go in their favour. If Ripple wins, that would mean that XRP would not be classified as a security as SEC has for a long time alleged. In the meantime, a breakout at $0.4 remains doubtful unless some positives involving the case come up.</p>

<p>Dogecoin has enjoyed several mini rallies in recent months amid speculation that it could play a part in Elon Musk’s Twitter plans. In fact, DOGE became one of the best performers in the crypto markets as the capricious billionaire, who has long had a penchant for the doggy-themed crypto, took the helm at Twitter.</p>



<p>With Musk now seriously considering stepping down as Twitter CEO, is the price of his favourite meme coin headed south?</p>



<h2 id="h-twitter-s-elon-musk-might-soon-relinquish-ceo-role"><strong>Twitter’s Elon Musk Might Soon Relinquish CEO Role</strong></h2>



<p>A new drama is emerging around Twitter as Elon Musk released a poll asking his followers whether or not he should step down from the microblogging site. At press time, the verdict was split, with 57.5% of the roughly 17.5 million responses supporting his resignation.</p>



<p>Musk indicated that he would accept the results of the Twitter survey, meaning he is ready to give that important role to another person.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604617643973124097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Notably, Musk will not be looking for just anybody but for a CEO who can actually “keep Twitter alive”. Interestingly, former NSA contractor turned whistleblower Edward Snowden declared he’s ready to be head of the social media company, and he would prefer bitcoin as payment for his new potential job.</p>



<h2><strong>Why It Matters For DOGE</strong></h2>



<p>Musk has been a major supporter of Dogecoin. His plan has always been to send DOGE skywards. The Tesla CEO’s statements about the currency have also consistently impacted its price. In October, for instance, DOGE rocketed to 12 cents on news of Musk’s completion of his <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-bulls-go-all-in-as-billionaire-dogefather-elon-musk-finally-closes-on-44b-twitter-deal/">$44 billion takeover</a> of Twitter and the leak of documents that hinted that the electric car mogul was working on a wallet prototype that would support deposits and withdrawals of crypto.</p>



<p>There was unconfirmed speculation that the aspiring Martian may use Dogecoin in his plans for Twitter 2.0 until he suggested that his time as the “Chief Twit” could be coming to a close.</p>



<p>Notably, the crypto industry is still reeling after a brutal month: investor confidence has been ruined following news that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-comes-clean-and-admits-that-it-owes-over-3-billion-to-its-50-biggest-creditors/">FTX</a>, once one of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, went bankrupt.</p>



<p>Who knows what’s coming? But if Musk is really resigning as CEO of the bird app, plans of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-rallies-30-on-twitter-payments-anticipation-as-elon-musk-props-up-dogecoin/">integrating Dogecoin payments</a> — and subsequently adding utility to the Shiba Inu-themed meme coin — might be put on hold. This means investors pining for a DOGE moonshot in the near term could be in for a rude awakening.</p>

<p>Binance.US, the American entity of the eponymous global exchange, has agreed to buy the assets of the now-bankrupt crypto brokerage firm Voyager Digital for a whopping $1.022 billion.</p>



<p>A Monday announcement notes that Binance.US emerged as the “highest and best bid” for its assets.</p>



<h2 id="h-binance-us-wins-bid-to-acquire-voyager"><strong>Binance.US Wins Bid To Acquire Voyager&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Voyager seems to have finally found a buyer for its assets.</p>



<p>The U.S. unit of Binance will pay Voyager $1.022 billion, representing the lender’s crypto portfolio (valued at around $1.002 billion), and an additional consideration equal to $20 million of incremental value.</p>



<p>The deal is expected to be closed by April 2023. However, it won’t go through until the bankruptcy court approves the purchase agreement on January 5. Meanwhile, Binance has agreed to make a $10 million deposit in good faith and will refund Voyager for some expenses up to a maximum of $15 million.</p>



<p>After crypto prices plunged, Voyager on 1st July blocked customers from withdrawing their money. Its clients thereon became company creditors in bankruptcy court, forced to get in line with restructuring lawyers and financiers as rookie participants in a potentially gruelling process to get their crypto back.</p>



<h2><strong>Finally, A Way Out For Users?</strong></h2>



<p>Binance.US is effectively bailing out Voyager Digital users as it “aims to return crypto to customers in kind, in accordance with court-approved disbursements and platform capabilities.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We hope our selection brings to an end a painful bankruptcy process which saw customers unfairly dragged into it at no fault of their own,&#8221; Binance.US president and CEO Brian Schroder <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianShroder/status/1604825059813920770">tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>He added that once the deal is completed, Voyager users will finally be able to access their crypto funds via new accounts at Binance.US by as early as March 2023.</p>



<p>Prior to its downfall, Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-bags-voyager-digital-assets-after-highly-competitive-bidding-process/">won</a> a $1.4 billion auction to acquire Voyager’s assets, beating out competitors Binance and Wave Financial. But with the exchange itself filing for bankruptcy in November, those plans changed.</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-says-indias-anti-crypto-regulatory-environment-is-preventing-cardanos-entry/">Charles Hoskinson</a>, the co-founder of Cardano, has hit back at XRP supporters over claims that he was trying to damage Ripple’s reputation and create FUD against the embattled network.</p>



<p>In a six-minute video Friday, Hoskinson expressed frustrations over how some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-whales-are-moving-millions-from-binance-as-looming-litigation-causes-record-outflows/">XRP community</a> members had responded to comments he made concerning the projected time the SEC vs Ripple case would likely end.</p>



<p>“<em>I talked a bit about a rumour that I had heard from a pretty reliable source who was close to the case about a potential resolution of the case by December 15<sup>th</sup>. So, I just threw it out there and said, well, that’s something I’ve heard,</em>” he said referring to comments he made in a surprise Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Monday, Dec 12.</p>



<p>According to Hoskinson, it was perfectly normal to reference the XRP case when asked whether Cardano was a security because the Ripple case is one of the corollaries to any cryptocurrencies being securities.</p>



<p>However, despite clarifying that he had made the comments out of a “rumour”, many people in both the XRP community and the media started spreading the word that Charles Hoskinson believed the case was going to get settled on December 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>



<p><em>“After it didn’t get resolved, I was accused of lying and I was accused of yet again creating a FUD and trolling,”</em> he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xrp-adherents"><strong>XRP Adherents</strong></h2>



<p>Hoskinson, who claimed to have been supportive of Ripple’s initiatives and efforts to popularize cryptocurrency, blamed a section of Ripple supporters for allegedly being close-minded.</p>



<p>Apart from not believing that XRP <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-saylor-says-xrp-is-a-security-touts-bitcoin-as-the-only-crypto-commodity/">is a security</a>, he noted that he did not think that the SEC was bribed to go after Ripple, saying that those claims were “a conspiracy”. Further, he noted that although Ethereum did get gentler treatment for some reason than others, that did not necessarily mean that there was bribery and corruption.</p>



<p><em>“For saying that,</em> I was mocked, harassed and brutalized by the XRP community, and yet again,<em> now I’m being brutalized.”</em></p>



<p><em>“So, it has left me asking, ‘is there any value at all in mentioning, engaging with or discussing anything about XRP?’ and at this juncture, given what’s happened,</em> I don’t think there is…If asked in the future about XRP,<em> I’m just going to say “NO COMMENT”,</em> he concluded, noting that never in his career in the crypto space had he encountered a community so willing to attack a person who frankly has not attacked them viciously.</p>

<p>Following the collapse of FTX, questions about what could have happened have been raging. In the past week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao” CZ” and Canadian investor Kevin O’Leary have also been engaging in a fiery battle of words for their alleged involvement with FTX.</p>



<p>Despite the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/">arrest of Sam Bankman-fried</a> “SBF”, the ex-CEO of FTX in the Bahamas on Dec 12, Congressional hearings on the FTX debacle kicked off as planned mid-week. Kevin O’Leary, accused of receiving $15 million to promote FTX despite allegedly knowing the exchange’s fraudulent activities testified on Dec 14. When asked by Senator Pat Toomey why he thought FTX failed, he noted that FTX and Binance were at war with each other, putting the other out of business intentionally. “<em>Binance is a massive unregulated global monopoly now. They put FTX out of business,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box afterwards, O’Leary stated that he had contacted SBF before his arrest, seeking answers on the circumstances leading to the collapse. According to him, SBF allegedly stated that they had spent $2 to $3 billion in “off-balance sheet funds” buying back FTX stock from Binance to try and prevent FTX’s collapse.</p>



<p>As it may be recalled, before the collapse of FTX in early November, CZ tweeted that they would <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-to-liquidate-ftxs-ftt-holdings-due-to-recent-revelations/">liquidate the entirety</a> of its position in FTX Token (totalling $2.1 billion) after a leaked balance sheet disclosed most FTX holdings were tied up in FTT. Less than three days after the tweet, FTT plunged roughly 94%, rendering the exchange bankrupt.</p>



<p>According to O’Leary, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-blasts-kevin-oleary-for-supposedly-defending-ftx/">CZ orchestrated FTX’s collapse</a> due to irresponsible communication. “<em>Why in the world would a block trade, like the one by CZ, be tweeted out saying- I have $550 million worth of FTT tokens. I&#8217;m going to put to the market?- You don’t trade like that. You go find buyers, you form a syndicate and you clear market with a trade,”</em> O’Leary charged.</p>



<p>On Thursday, CZ fired back, calling O’Leary a liar and accusing him of making a “bunch of nonsense claims.” According to the Binance CEO, it was suspicious that O’Leary had chosen only to take up what SBF had told him as the truth without digging deeper. He further accused the 68-year-old investor of ignoring all the “small spendings” by FTX and instead focusing on Binance’s sale of FTT.</p>



<p><em>“He (O’Leary) says he did not know that Binance was a shareholder of FTX, so he invested in FTX without looking at the cap table, but he was very specific in the way he accounts for a transaction two years ago, so that’s kind of contradictory,” </em>said CZ<em>. “So, I think Kevin is a liar, I think he is lying about a bunch of stuff”</em>. On Friday, O’Leary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2feTmaguqhU&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision">responded,</a> arguing that CZ’s accusations against him were a lie.</p>



<p>That said, as the war between the two businessmen rages on, the possibility of arrests or a Madoff Clawback for funds received from FTX being imposed on the two businessmen has become a concern for the crypto community.</p>

<p>Just a year ago, the cryptocurrency market recorded one of the best yearly runs <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whales-double-down-on-gigantic-btc-buys-despite-macro-headwinds/">Bitcoin</a> has ever had. While bearish calls were made early into 2021, Bitcoin bulls pushed prices to a staggering $68,000 in November of the same year.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-bitcoin-headed-in-2023-the-bearish"><strong>Where is Bitcoin headed in 2023?; The bearish</strong></h2>



<p>Positive sentiments began to flood the Bitcoin community, and major price predictions were made ahead of 2022. But Bitcoin would underperform, starting the new year with a massive price decline. </p>



<p>January saw Bitcoin at $35,000; Prices fluctuated between $30,000 &#8211; $45,000 between January and June.</p>



<p>The months leading up to December would see Bitcoin slowly lose momentum and go downhill. Although key players were still bullish, the recent events plaguing the market have swayed prominent voices.</p>



<p>From VanEck, a leading global investment manager offering U.S. investors exposure to gold and ETF investment, Bitcoin is expected to decline by 29.4% from its press time price of $16,789. This, however, is only going to persist from January till March.</p>

<p>“<em>Bitcoin will test $10-12K in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter.” </em>&#8211; VanEck.</p>



<p>From April till June, Bitcoin is expected to take a leap upward, as inflation and other surrounding activities are cited as factors that could spur the next bull run for the leading cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>VanEck explains in a recent tweet below, saying; </p>



<p><em>“In the second half of 2023, Bitcoin will rise to $30K. Lower inflation, easing energy concerns, a possible truce in Ukraine, and a turnaround in M2 supply will power the start of a new bull market.”  </em></p>



<h2><strong>Bitcoin 2023; The bullish </strong></h2>



<p>Taking a more bullish approach is Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX.</p>



<p>He recently expressed certainty that Bitcoin miners and centralized exchanges that swayed market movement by selling Bitcoin in large quantities will no longer drive lower prices.</p>



<p>Maintaining that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-on-why-bitcoin-price-has-likely-reached-bottom/">Bitcoin has bottomed</a>, he reckons that liquidations will be halted as sellers are already done selling. More importantly, he looks to the federal reserve to revive risk assets like Bitcoin by implementing new monetary policies. An even more bullish Tim Draper forecasted $250,000 for Bitcoin by late 2022 or early 2023.</p>



<p>While Bitcoin is attempting to clutch $20,000 before the year&#8217;s close, it isn&#8217;t very likely, considering existing market conditions, that $250,000 will be attained this year.</p>



<p>Most analysts and investors remain fixed on the possible outcome for Bitcoin next year. Key figures have also expressed bullish sentiments for altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA).</p>

<p>Blockchain analytics provider CryptoQuant sees an Ethereum (ETH) price blackout on the horizon. According to CryptoQuant, potential negative fundamental factors could precipitate a mass sell-off event for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.</p>



<h2><strong>Why A Vicious ETH Sell-Off Is Likely</strong></h2>



<p>CryptoQuant has pinpointed issues that could trigger a full-blown ETH correction.</p>



<p>The first potential catalyst is the dramatic increase of inflows into the ETH 2.0 deposit contract, where staked ether is trapped until the implementation of the next big upgrade, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gargantuan-feat-staked-ether-withdrawals-are-coming-in-march-2023-core-developers-concur/">Shanghai</a>. The amount locked in the contract now represents 12% of the total ETH supply. A chart shared by CryptoQuant shows that the amount of new depositors has been dropping.</p>



<p>With a target release time frame of March 2023, the Shanghai hard fork will make it possible to withdraw staked ETH, tying up loose ends from the monumental September Merge update.</p>



<p>The second factor is that ether balances on centralized exchanges continue declining. Analysts at the on-chain analytics platform harbour the opinion that the forthcoming Shanghai upgrade will likely initiate a major ether sell-off due to the staked ETH withdrawals. There&#8217;s some $18.9 billion worth of ether currently staked with the network at press time, according to data aggregated on Dune Analytics.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-future-outlook-for-the-eth-ecosystem"><strong>The Future Outlook For The ETH Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>It’s now over one year since the crypto market peaked in November 2021, and there are no signs of a new bull rally commencing in the near term. Cryptocurrencies were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-take-a-nosedive-as-fed-signal-more-interest-rates-hike/">shaken </a>yesterday following a hawkish speech from the U.S. Central bank. The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points as it continues to slow the economy.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s difficult to predict which way the market will move, some believe the positive change in ether&#8217;s tokenomics brought about by the Merge technological upgrade could ultimately help the cryptocurrency outperform bitcoin and the broader market once the FTX contagion ebbs and the macroeconomic conditions improve.</p>



<p>Ether is changing hands at $1,177 as of press time, a 4.55% drop over the last 24 hours. Perhaps time will tell whether the No. 2 crypto is due for an epic dump or a bullish trend reversal.</p>

<p>Following the downfall of FTX, different countries are looking to tighten their policies, specifically for digital currencies, in an attempt to safeguard investor funds.</p>



<h2 id="h-key-investors-at-risk-following-the-new-development"><strong>Key investors at risk following the new development</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It appears that Canada is taking this path, as it recently took steps towards restructuring its regulations by placing a ban on Margin and Leverage trading for digital currencies.</p>



<p>Companies affiliated with cryptocurrency trading were informed about the recent development in an update made by the official organization of Canada&#8217;s provincial and territorial securities regulators, also known as the Canadian securities Administration (CSA).</p>



<p>In the update, it is made known that a revaluation of existing requirements has taken place, leading to the conclusion that said requirements need to be “expanded across all cryptocurrency platforms within the country&#8221;.</p>



<p>Excerpts from the update, as seen on the official securities regulator site, reads as follows; </p>



<p><em>“Custodians will generally be considered qualified if they are regulated by a financial regulator in Canada, the U.S., or a similar jurisdiction with a supervisory regime for conduct and financial regulation.”</em></p>



<p>The implementation process will be carried out by both the CSA and other crypto trading platforms.</p>



<p>“<em>CSA members will contact registered crypto trading platforms individually to discuss the application of the expanded terms and conditions to those firms. The CSA will publish further details about this updated approach in the future.”</em></p>



<p>The move&#8217;s effects on cryptocurrency trading platforms in Canada might include a decline in Cryptocurrency trading activities over time. Cryptocurrency trading platforms operating in the country might need to halt the banned options in order to maintain the law. Larger investors are significantly at risk, as margin trading requires using borrowed capital in larger sums from a brokerage.</p>



<p>Exchanges offering cryptocurrency trading might also record a loss in revenue, as it shuts its doors to two of the most commonly used cryptocurrency trading methods. Canadian investors are also likely to record losses, as it is uncertain whether or not they would look elsewhere to continue their trading activities.</p>

<p>Gary Harmon, a 31-year-old man from Ohio, is set to plead guilty after being charged with stealing 713 bitcoins stored in a Trezor hardware wallet seized by the US government. Garry was arrested in July 2021 and arraigned on money laundering charges, among other crimes, after the bitcoins (worth around $5 million) were stolen remotely “as authorities looked on helplessly.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-story-of-two-brothers"><strong>A Story of Two Brothers</strong></h2>



<p>The said device had first been confiscated from Larry Harmon, then CEO of early bitcoin mixing services Coin Ninja and DropBit and elder brother to Gary. Larry had been arrested in 2020 in connection to laundering $311 million in crypto through Darknet websites linked to illegal drugs, becoming the first person in the US to be charged with crimes related to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-hoskinson-slams-the-us-treasury-for-banning-tornado-cash/">crypto mixing.</a></p>



<p>According to court documents, Gary Harmon attended two of his brother’s bail hearings and noted that the prosecutors lacked the seed recovery phrase required to access more than 4,800 bitcoins seized from his brother. Prosecutors suspected that Gary generated a seed phrase to retrieve the private keys, which enabled him to go online, key in a pin and drain the wallet.</p>



<h2><strong>Gary’s Downfall</strong></h2>



<p>Gary’s downfall came after his lifestyle drastically changed shortly after the theft, raising suspicion. Indeed, although prosecutors at first suspected Larry was behind the theft after being released on bail, Larry told them that the culprit was his brother, which helped strengthen their case against Gary.</p>



<p>Although court records showed that Gary lived on stimulus funds and unemployment checks, prosecutors were baffled by photos showing Gary “smiling smugly in a hot tub full of cash and surrounded by scantily clad women.”</p>



<p>Further investigations showed that Garry used two crypto mixers to hide traces of 519 of the stolen Bitcoins. Prosecutors also claimed that Gary had posted 68 bitcoins as collateral for a $1.2 million loan. In contrast, another portion of it has been spent on the purchase of a luxury condo in Cleveland.</p>



<p>That said, Gary, 31, is expected to appear on Dec 22 in a Washington-based federal court for a plea deal hearing to which he is set to plead guilty based on the latest court records.</p>



<p>While it is easy to trace the movement of cryptocurrencies via the blockchain, crypto-mixing platforms enable money launderers and other nefarious actors to obfuscate transactions making it harder to track stolen funds. This year, the US <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-treasury-sanctions-notorious-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash/">banned Tornado Cash</a>, a notorious crypto mixer alleged to have helped launder billions of dollars in crypto, attracting praise and condemnation.</p>

The post, which included the hacker&#8217;s account details, added that the &#8220;<em>initial understanding is the attacker overtook owner authority, but the authority has been halted on AMM &amp; farm programs for now</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The exploit was discovered at around 2 PM UTC on Dec. 16, when Raydium admin posted 1,000 transactions to the Solana network – where each transaction moved liquidity without depositing an equivalent LP token. The vulnerability allowed the bad actor to access the LPs&#8217; funds – draining USDC, Wrapped SOL, and native Raydium token RAY.</p>



<p>Per data from analytics firm Nansen, &#8220;<em>The wallet draining LP Pools from Raydium liquidity pools has received over $2.2 million now, including $1.6 million SOL</em>,&#8221; the company shared the information on its official Twitter account.</p>



<h2 id="h-major-platforms-on-raydium-including-prism-and-compendium-withdraw-funds"><strong>Major platforms on Raydium, including Prism and Compendium, withdraw funds</strong></h2>



<p>Responding to the security breach, notable platforms based on Raydium have withdrawn their assets &#8211; even as the online crypto community faults the DEX for not having a multisig cold storage.</p>



<p>Compendium Foundation announced that it had temporarily withdrawn $CMFI, $USDC, and $SOL liquidity from Raydium following the incident. According to the firm,&#8221; <em>the attacker gained access to keys used (for collecting) fees from LP pools, and authority has since been halted</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>PRISM – a DEX aggregator aggregating liquidity sources across Raydium and Solana – has also pulled its fund from the exchange. The platform withdrew PRISM/USDC liquidity from Raydium, urging users to do the same. Per Prism&#8217;s account of the events, the malicious wallet was &#8220;<em>draining LP pools from Raydium liquidity pools using admin wallet as a signer without burning LP tokens</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Raydium is a decentralized exchange on Solana that allows users to trade varying cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. According to data from DeFi aggregator DefiLlama, Raydium&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) is $36 million &#8211; down 98% from a high of $2.21 billion in November before the fall of FTX.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, plunged further Friday as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-take-a-nosedive-as-fed-signal-more-interest-rates-hike/">hawkish comments</a> by Fed’s Chair Jeremy Powell on Wednesday continued to weigh down on investors.</p>



<p>Since tapping an all-time high in November last year, Bitcoin has lost over 75% of its value thanks to a myriad of factors. Attempts by price to recover were thwarted earlier last month by the unexpected debacle of crypto exchange FTX, sending prices below the $18,300 psychological support, which has increasingly become harder for bulls to breach.</p>



<p>According to data from IntoTheBlock, only 36% of BTC holders are making a profit at current prices, 14% are at breakeven, and 51% are in the red. Notably, a majority of those in profit are investors who have held coins for more than one year. Further, a majority of investors continue to hold a bearish outlook on Bitcoin, which is one of the most prevalent signals of an impending trend change.</p>



<h2 id="h-investors-scoop-more-btc"><strong>Investors Scoop More BTC</strong></h2>



<p>However, despite the continued drop in crypto prices, the number of Bitcoin investors stacking BTC recently has been rising, based on data by Glassnode.</p>



<p><em>“Bitcoin&#8217;s addresses holding between 100 to 10,000 BTC have bought $726m in BTC the past 9 days,”</em> Glassnode wrote on Thursday, adding that 40,747 more Bitcoin (worth $726 million) had collectively entered those key whale wallets within that period. It is important to note that this category represents only 0.0364% of all BTC addresses. However, despite being small, this group typically makes decisions leading to future price movements.</p>



<p>Stablecoins have also been painting an encouraging picture. <em>“Stablecoin assets like USDT, BUSD, &amp; DAI are also being bought quickly. This is a recipe for good things,”</em> the firm added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hWazW20CMd3lmIU_5lzPxqeUbOBwFfgkIoEykxXU4Q4_lDXJQ279dQIyil1hLkhjauaoAyuodsaZAjiTXWG9ZrYv7D-Wx32LGtVUnzri_XKLTDl8XxdVroj2PGzy0TJz4Zg8o-uopdmSxMcttYGEgfmwm0uPVgf-6Ra2blaRtyVdWNXt5oQb_h6rP9lVGhNrWFiIXaqP_w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The chart above illustrates the percentage of supply held by key price-moving addresses for BTC, USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI and can be used to reveal the future of crypto prices.</p>



<p>According to the firm, “<em>when these lines are mainly going down, it&#8217;s not a great sign”</em> because it suggests wealthy players and institutional investors are exiting the markets. The chart thus depicts increased interest by more prominent players to purchase the said assets after reducing their holdings for about 14 months straight. Although we are yet to see a turnaround in price, with whales finally accumulating rather than dumping, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-on-why-bitcoin-price-has-likely-reached-bottom/">Bitcoin&#8217;s ebbing tide</a> may be in the offing.</p>



<p>At press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading at $16,829 after a 3.84% decrease in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Earlier yesterday, the price attempted to recover, surging as much as $17,486 after bouncing off weekly support at $17,250 before deteriorating.</p>

<ul>
<li>The New York State Department of Financial Services has issued a new guideline to protect customers against the dangers of another cryptocurrency crash.</li>



<li>The new policy will make banks submit a detailed business plan to the body 90 days before they delve into cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>As New York takes the bull by the horn, other jurisdictions are expected to follow suit in the coming months.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>A cross-section of players in the digital asset industry believes it needs strategic regulations across all sectors to bring up dwindling confidence among investors.</p>



<p>The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released a new cryptocurrency regulation for banks and other financial institutions in its jurisdiction. The new guideline gives banks a 90-day window to submit a business plan to the authorities before dealing with digital asset firms.</p>



<p>As more banks and institutions delve into digital assets, the guideline will act as checks to monitor their investments and levels of exposure. The business plan submitted must be detailed, capturing key areas to enable the DFS to carry out consumer protection analysis, corporate governance, and oversight, as well as risk analysis.</p>



<p>The hallmark of this new move, according to the NYDFS, is to protect consumers&#8217; “hard-earned money” in the wake of the FTX collapse. </p>



<p>“<em>It is critical that regulators communicate in a timely, transparent manner about the evolution of our regulatory approach</em>,” NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris highlighted in a statement issued by the department.</p>



<p>The NYDFS, in a statement, said that the regulation is final as it deals with essential issues in protecting users but promised to continue engaging with stakeholders in the industry to make better laws.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-regulations-to-follow"><strong>More regulations to follow</strong></h2>



<p>As New York releases a new guideline for banks, several jurisdictions within and outside the United States are pushing for broader and more robust cryptocurrency regulations to prevent a repeat of FTX. At the FTX hearing yesterday, Kevin O’Leary, executive producer of Shark Tank, and Sen. Cynthia Lummis stressed the need for more <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-deliberate-move-shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-blames-binance-for-ftx-collapse/">regulation</a> to “<em>save the industry.”</em></p>



<p>The Deputy Secretary US Treasury, Wally Adeyemo, has called for more international cooperation to regulate the industry, which will promote stability and prevent the illegal use of digital assets.</p>



<p>Across industry spaces, users&#8217; and investors’ confidence went a step back following the FTX issue, leading to widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). As new and tighter regulations begin to take effect, it creates a ripple effect of increasing investor confidence and pushing back FUDs in users in the long run.</p>

<p>The NFT community, alongside the broader cryptocurrency market, has expressed shock over the recent announcement from former U.S. President <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cryptocurrency-explosion-is-coming-former-u-s-president-donald-trump-warns/">Donald Trump</a>. In what most have termed one of the most unexpected “announcements”  in the NFT ecosystem this year, Trump has put up some Superman-based NFT trading cards for sale.</p>



<h2 id="h-doland-trump-receives-feedback-from-concerned-supporters"><strong>Doland Trump receives feedback from concerned supporters</strong></h2>



<p>The announcement was made on his own social media platform called “Truth Social.” It has since been received positively on the platform, with over 1,000 post shares and over 3,000 comments. The card shows Trump dressed in the famous Superman full-body suit, while a rage with the letter “T” is labelled on the suit.</p>



<p><strong>“</strong>MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT! My official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection is here,” he said on the platform. </p>



<p>He then revealed some details about the cards, noting that they were limited while adding that they are significant for their connection to his personal life and career.</p>



<p>As excerpts of the statement read;</p>



<p><em>“These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career! Collect all your favorite Trump Digital Trading Cards, very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.”</em></p>



<p>NFT collectors and onlookers alike have voiced concerns about the price, which they consider extremely low, especially coming from the former President. However, Trump assured that they would be acquired and sold out in no time.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;GET YOUR CARDS NOW! Only $99 each! Would make a great Christmas gift. Don&#8217;t Wait. They will be gone, I believe, very quickly!” He urged.</em></p>



<p>While the NFT community awaits the sale turnout, Twitter users in the NFT community have expressed dissatisfaction with the move. Their collective sentiments highlight shock, mirroring their disapproval of the cards,  which they believe isn’t worth it.</p>



<p>One critique is quoted saying; “Trump is releasing NFT trading cards of himself… it really is the end of the road,&#8221;</p>



<h2><strong>NFT market hurdles persist</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, the NFT market is still bearish, as the decline in NFT sales persists.</p>



<p>The NFT market has gone from $1.02 trillion to $970.03 billion from January to September 2022. In November alone, NFT sales volume declined by 20%. </p>



<p>Popular entrepreneur Gary Vee attempted to grace the root cause of the problem by citing greed, oversupply and mediocre project launch as some of the factors propelling the industry’s downfall.</p>
