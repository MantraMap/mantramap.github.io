In today&#8217;s news, the prominent stablecoin TrueUSD &#8211; with the ticker TUSD &#8211; is now undergoing a management change.  According to a thread this morning by the project’s official Twitter handle, Archblock Inc., the current TUSD operator, has begun the transfer of total control of Token to its Asian-based owners, Techteryx Ltd.  Techteryx Finally Assumes Control Of TrueUSD Back in December 2020, Techteryx acquired ownership of TUSD but hired Archblock to keep maintaining the stablecoin’s operations. And for the last two years in which Archblock remained TUSD’s operator, Techteryx claims to have been focusing on expanding the token’s foreign use cases in the global markets.  Related Reading: BUSD Market Cap Plunge Of 80% Raises Concerns Of Impending Collapse However, Archblock has now commenced the transfer of control yesterday, July 13, marking the end phase of TUSD’s international transition. Upon completion, Techteryx will reportedly assume full management of all aspects of the stablecoin’s operation. These controls will include mining and redemptions, customer onboarding and compliance, conservation of fiat reserve, and maintenance of banking and fiduciary relationships. During the transition period, Archblock will continue to support the US-based TUSD users, with Techteryx stepping in with the necessary guidance and further updates.  Prior to today&#8217;s news, TUSD has attracted some interest especially following Binance&#8217;s recent moves with the stablecoin. On June 21, the cryptocurrency exchange announced the launch of a TUSD zero-maker fee promotion for spot and margin trading pairs beginning from June 30. Interestingly, Binance had minted $1 billion worth of TUSD on the Tron network a week before making that announcement becoming the largest holder of the token.
