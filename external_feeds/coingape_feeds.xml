										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="900" height="540" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/19192809/bitcoin-1.png" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>After a brutal correction throughout 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) started this year of 2023 on a solid footing. The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency is already up by 40% this month and is all set to record its best January in a decade since 2013.</p>
<p>This month of January has added $280 billion to the entire crypto market. While heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum have posed a 40% price rally, some smaller altcoins like Solana and Axie Infinity have literally doubled in value this month.</p>
<p>The recent rebound in the broader crypto market comes amid expectations of slow interest rate hikes by the Fed. Furthermore, as the high inflation cools down, the Fed will likely cut borrowing costs very soon.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s rally shows that the cryptocurrency market is coming out of the tremors caused by the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. The market is willing to settle and heal from the scars of a major liquidity crisis triggered by the fall of FTX and other crypto lenders like Genesis, etc. Noelle Acheson, author of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-barrels-toward-historic-january-as-crypto-market-jumps-by-280-billion-1.1876538" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>January “feels like a month of new beginnings, with emerging clarity as to bankruptcy proceedings, corporate restructurings and market fundamentals pointing to the bottom being behind us&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Will the Bitcoin Rebound Last?</h3>
<p>The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin has shared a strong relationship with tech stocks. Besides, the recent surge in the BTC price also comes following the recent bounce in the tech space. Some analysts have also warned that the rate hikes in the market could stay longer than expected.</p>
<p>Last week, Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Michael Hartnett said that the comeback in Bitcoin and other speculative assets &#8220;will likely reverse&#8221; if wages, oil, and consumer price increases to shift the narrative of a possible &#8220;soft-landing&#8221;. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also hinted that the rates could remain elevated for a while.</p>
<p>On the other hand, optimists are betting on the current momentum and expect <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-price-breaks-out-of-uncertainty-is-25000-on-the-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin to touch $25,000</a> in this ongoing rally.</p>

However, the resulting consolidation seems like a short break before the recovery shoots up again. Thus, today we&#8217;ll analyze the top two memecrypto, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu coin, to identify their near future goal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market leaders</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> currency trades at $23630 with an intraday loss of 0.47%; meanwhile, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum price</a> exchange hands at $1635, with an intraday loss of 0.57%.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu coin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-137006" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/30083428/Screenshot_20230130_083317.png" alt="" width="1735" height="455" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a>, the Shiba Inu coin has witnessed steady growth in the first three weeks of 2023. This pattern formation itself is a sign of sustained recovery in the market and brings several entry opportunities for interested traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for the fourth week, the coin price is experiencing high volatility, causing a consolidation phase above the $0.000011 support. However, this consolidation should be temporary, and If the coin price shows sustainability above the mentioned support, the price is likely to resume a bullish recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/frZxPfWS.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained buying, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu coin price</a> could rise more 17.4% to hit the neckline resistance of the rounding bottom pattern. However,  in ideal bullish conditions, this pattern breakout should lead to a price rally to $0.00002.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-137005" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/30083403/Screenshot_20230130_083116.png" alt="" width="1726" height="519" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">Dogecoin price</a> witnessed a consolidation phase for the past two weeks showing a power struggle to surpass the $0.091 ceiling. However, after an explosive rally, a minor consolation is essential to stabilize the excessive buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in deeper analysis, this consolidation is part of a famous bullish reversal pattern called cup and handle. The prices have reached the handle portion of this pattern, and are waiting for the breakout of neckline resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/NbxJxdB6.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the DOGE coin trades at $0.088, with an intraday loss of 1.14%. Thus, a daily candle closing above the $0.0916 resistance will signal the resumption of the bullish recovery. This potential rally could drive the DOGE price 18% higher to hit the $0.108 mark.</span></p>

The bull run formed a local top $1677 mark and started witnessing a minor correction phase. However, after an explosive rally, a temporary pull is essential for the prices to stabilize the aggressive buying. Here’s how this Ethereum price may escape this consolidation.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price shows a consolidation phase between $1677 and $1500 levels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $1677 will support buyer to carry and strong rally</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.3 Billion, indicating a 76% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/A4pp82yJ.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the 4-hour time frame chart, this consolidation has shaped into an inverted Head and Shoulder pattern. The downsloping trendline shown in the above chart is the neckline resistance of the pattern, and the buyers are currently trying to break this barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inverted head and should pattern is one of the commonly observed bullish reversal patterns, which could encourage a strong bullish rally. Today, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant inflow and jumped 3%. </span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the 4-hour candle closes above the downsloping trendline, the buyers will get suitable support to escape the ongoing consolidation phase and rechallenge the $1677.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a breakout above the $1677 neckline resistance of the cup and handle pattern will intensify the bullish momentum. In favorable market conditions, these aforementioned breaks out could drive the Ethereum price to the 2300 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the traders should be cautious at this resistance as another reversal from it could weaken the bullish momentum and prolong consolidation.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MACD: despite a bearish crossover, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">MACD</a>(Blue) and the signal(orange) line didn&#8217;t offer enough spread to indicate the buyers still possessed trend control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMAs: the 20-and-200-day EMA wavering near the $1500 mark creates strong support for buyers during possible corrections.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1627</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $1677 and $1800</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $500 and $1420</span></li>
</ul>

The resulting consolidation phase offered the coin price a short break from the aggressive buying and recuperated the bullish momentum. Today, the prices show a breakout attempt from the $23400 resistance, indicating the buyers are getting for further rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above the $23400 resistance may surge the prices 5.2% higher to hit $2500</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 20-and-200 EMA encourages the resumption of a bullish recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $22.2 Billion, indicating a 13% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/UJHNjP6A.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price witnessed a parabola recovery in the first three weeks of 2023. Amid this bull run, the coin price rallied 42% since the January 1st low($16499) and recently hit the $23400 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the 4th week, the Bitcoin price went sideways and showed a power struggle to surpass the $23400 resistance level. Moreover, the high wick rejection on both ends of daily candles indicated uncertainty in the market. </span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rejection candle also reflected signs of exhausted bullish momentum and created a minor consideration phase between the mentioned resistance and $22500 support. Anyhow, this consolidation was important for Bitcoin price as it stabilized the excessive buying during the recent rally. Moreover, the prices checked their suitability above the newly reclaimed levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, today the Bitcoin price witnessed a significant inflow and jumped 2.25%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long green candle pierced the overhead resistance of 23400, suggesting the release of trapped bullish momentum. If the daily candle closes above-breached resistance, it should flip into viable support and bolster a bullish recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-breakout rally will likely surge the Bitcoin price 5.3% higher to hit the $25000 psychological barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the daily candle closes below the $22500 resistance again, the consolidation phase will prolong for a few more sessions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>&#8211; The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily- RSI slope</a> wavering high in the bullish territory indicates the buying pressure is still high, and a longer correction is expected in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>:  the 20-50-and-100-day EMAs rising higher may provide dynamic support during a possible pullback</span></p>

While participation from whales was missing during the early days, recent data suggests whales are now actively buying and trading crypto tokens.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are also witnessing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whale accumulation</a> as the price continues to hit higher. Bitcoin (BTC) price is trading at $23,578 and Ethereum (ETH) price trades at $1,615.</p>
<h2>Whales Accumulating These Crypto Tokens</h2>
<p>According to WhaleStats, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Polygon (MATIC), and Decentraland (MANA) are the most used smart contracts and tokens accumulated by top Ethereum whales.</p>
<p>MATIC is one of the most used smart contracts among the top 5000 <span class="link-complex-target">ETH</span> whales in the last 24 hours, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WhaleStats/status/1619668411977433088" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">as per WhaleStats</a>.

<p>Santiment reported that a whale bought 59 million MATIC tokens worth $56 million. The whale was able to buy MATIC just before a 20% jump in MATIC price. At the time of writing, MATIC price is trading at $1.19, up 7% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has witnessed huge speculation amid the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shibarium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shibarium</a> Beta launch.

<p>Shiba Inu is the most used smart contract and purchased tokens by top Ethereum whales in the last 24 hours. SHIB price trades at $0.00001204, up 2% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Decentraland (MANA) price has skyrocketed over 15% in the last 24 hours, with the current price trading at $0.78. The project has witnessed increased development activity in the last few weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/decentraland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentraland</a> is the most used smart contract among the top 100 <span class="link-complex-target">ETH</span> whales in 24hrs. Moreover, MANA is the top 10 purchased tokens among the 100 biggest <span class="link-complex-target">ETH</span> whales in the last 24hrs.</p>
<h2>DOGE, ADA, AAVE Among Top Tokens Purchased by BSC Whales</h2>

Since last month, NFT sales have increased by 39.98%, NFT transactions have increased by 28.5%, but NFT buyers have dropped by 3.76%, according to the NFT industry data aggregator cryptoslam. Anyhow, today, we will analyze the daily technical chart for some of the top NFTs tokens to see their growth potential in 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apecoin(APE)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/ofXh8bhN.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 21st, the Apecoin price gave a bullish breakout from the resistance trendline of a two-month-long <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">rising channel pattern</a>. Now, in theory, this pattern is known to trigger a significant downfall upon The breakdown of its support friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the aforementioned resistance breakout is a sign of strong commitment from buyers to chase higher prices. By the press time, the price traders at $6.1 and witnessed a 13.5% rise in the last five days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This price jump has recently $6-5.93 resistance offering a suitable entry opportunity for sidelines traders. Thus, with sustained buying, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/apecoin/">Apecoin price</a> could rise another 25% to an early target of the $7.6 mark, followed by a $9.13 barrier.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentraland(MANA)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/k/KneI8ONG.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/decentraland/">MANA coin price</a> shows the formation of a cup and handle pattern in the daily time frame chart. Over the last two weeks, the coin price witnessed high volatility and started consolidating between the $0.75 and $0.6 levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, today the Mana price experienced strong buying pressure and breached the $0.75 neckline resistance of the above-mentioned pattern. With a 15% intraday gain, the coin price currently exchanges hands at the $0.798 mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the daily candle closes above the $0.75 resistance, the bullish pattern will be triggered and increase the underlying buying pressure in the market. The post-breakout rally could surge the coin 60% higher to poke the $1.22 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theta Network(THETA)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/YZhZWhfP.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the Theta network coin shows a simple structure of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a>. Amid the recent recovery, the prices rose 54% from January 1st and currently trade at $1.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a bearish divergence in the daily RSI slope and the power struggle of buyers to surpass the local resistance of $1.135 indicates a higher possibility of a minor correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential correction will replenish the bullish momentum for even higher gains. Anyhow, under the influence of the bullish pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/theta-network/">theta coin price</a> should witness a sustained recovery to $1.7, registering a 52% gain.</span></p>

However, the BTC price fails to hold the level and fell back to $23.3K. Legendary trader Peter Brandt has shared his prediction on Bitcoin price for a few days as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> enters a crucial week with the Fed rate hike decision and tech giants&#8217; quarterly earnings.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Retouches $23.5K</h2>
<p>Peter Brandt, a top trader and analyst, in a tweet on January 29 shared his Bitcoin analysis for the week. The upcoming week is crucial as the U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> announces its rate hike decision that is likely to drive the markets in the next few months. Moreover, tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, and Google report their quarterly results.</p>
<p>Peter Brandt expects a fall in Bitcoin price as it fails to break the strong resistance and continues to move sideways. The Bitcoin price saw a 40% rally in January and looks weak ahead of the Fed rate hike decision. Traders await a pullback in BTC price to buy at low levels.</p>
<p>However, he remains optimistic about a Bitcoin price rally to $65K in mid-2023. As per Brandt, the BTC price will hit $25K and witness a correction to $19K. Thereafter, a rally to at least $65K can be witnessed. However, he also believes that it’s difficult to predict prices in the current market conditions.</p>
<p>Crypto analysts <span class="account-inline txt-ellipsis">Michael van de Poppe and </span><span class="account-inline txt-ellipsis">Credible Crypto have also suggested a <a href="https://coingape.com/analyst-predicts-best-level-to-buy-bitcoin-as-price-to-rally-above-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pullback in Bitcoin price</a> before a massive rally above $25K.</span></p>

<h2>Fed Rate Hike Remains Primary Factor Impacting Bitcoin Move</h2>
<p>While traders speculate whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will go with a 25 bps rate hike or another 50 bps rate hike, recent jobs and inflation data points to a lower rate hike. The CME FedWatch Tool <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicates</a> a 98.4% probability of a 25 bps rate hike.</p>
<p>The U.S. Dollar Index (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DXY</a>) also moves sideways under 102. The DXY is likely to remain volatile ahead of the Fed rate hike decision and a rise will cause the Bitcoin price to fall.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is currently trading at $23,406, up 2% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $22,908 and $23,463, respectively.</p>

Crypto exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> is converting the ERC20 version of BNB to the native BEP2 version after the launch of the BNB blockchain. The BNB price jumped nearly 2% to hit a 24-hour high of $315.</p>
<h2>Binance Converts 16 Million BNB (ERC-20) to BNB (BEP2)</h2>
<p>Binance CEO &#8220;CZ&#8221; in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1619605716003872769" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on January 29 said the Binance team will transfer/burn large amounts of BNB tokens in the next few hours. He requested critics to avoid spreading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUD</a> after noticing these transactions on-chain.</p>
<p>The burn is linked to converting the ERC20 version of BNB to the native (BEP2) version. Since the launch of native BNB blockchains, Binance converts BNB (ERC20) tokens held by some holders. Recently, Binance announces depositing about 16 million BNB (ERC20) tokens to a Binance wallet.</p>
<p>Etherscan on-chain <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdf6046db8c41385b2201166b495457528a600895d6a838f74a54ff91f81a8120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> confirms a burn transaction from the &#8216;Binance 8&#8217; wallet at 07:59 AM on January 29. Also, the BNB Chain <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://explorer.bnbchain.org/tx/54CDB47FBF3A0E349676C9E4C67C8D7EAAB4D1ED8143129ADC344D737D5FEB9E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explorer</a> reveals a burn of 16,186,608 BNB tokens, with a transaction fee of just 0.000075 BNB.</p>
<p>Crypto Twitter reacts to CZ&#8217;s tweet and appreciates the transparency from crypto exchange Binance. The burning of these ERC20 BNB tokens doesn&#8217;t count towards the quarterly burn or impact BNB’s overall circulation.</p>
<p>On January 17, Binance burned 2,064,494.32 BNB tokens in the <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-burns-over-2-million-bnb-tokens-rally-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22nd quarterly BNB token burn</a>. Binance uses the Auto-Burn system to reduce the total <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/circulating-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulating supply</a> to 100,000,000 BNB.</p>
<h2>BNB Token Price Jumps After Burn</h2>
<p>After the burn of 16,186,608 BNB tokens by the Binance team, the BNB price hit a high of $315. The BNB price jumped nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $312. The 24-hour low and high are $304 and $315, respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, trading volume has declined in the last 24 hours, indicating a did not immediately react to the BNB burn. The crypto market continues to trade sideways ahead of the U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> rate hike decision on February 1.</p>

<h2>South Korea&#8217;s Ministry of Justice Introducing Crypto Tracking System</h2>
<p>South Korea has become one of the leading crypto markets in recent years, with crypto-related crimes also rising higher. Crypto regulations and government oversight have increased in the country due to rising crypto crimes amid adoption, especially after the Terra-LUNA crisis.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice will <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.khgames.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=208502" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">introduce</a> a &#8220;crypto tracking system&#8221; in the first half of this year to track transactions linked to money laundering and criminal proceeds.</p>
<p>The ministry will use the tracking system to check and monitor transaction records, extract details on the relationship between transactions, and confirm fund sources before and after transfers. In addition, a plan to develop their own crypto tracking and analysis system during the same period is also in progress.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We will overhaul the scientific investigation infrastructure (infrastructure) in response to the modernization of crime.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Ministry of Justice also plans to establish the &#8216;National Digital Forensic Cloud System&#8217; during the first half of this year. The cloud system will be modeled around the digital forensic system (D-Net) to enable other agencies to use the forensic cloud system.</p>
<p>Last year, the Cyber ​​Investigation Bureau of the National Police Agency signed an agreement with five major Korean <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchanges</a>. It will prevent the illegal use of virtual assets and create a safe trading environment.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice also established the &#8220;Digital Asset Coordinator&#8221; Network to track crypto-related crimes. The &#8220;Digital Asset Coordinator&#8221; Network was created as part of the digital asset regulatory framework announced by the White House in September last year.</p>

This bullish reversal pattern is commonly observed in market bottoms and offers a sustained recovery to coin holders. Thus, with the ongoing recovery in the market, the Avalanche Coin Price has recently breached this pattern’s key neckline resistance, indicating the prices are ready to take off.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the neckline resistance of the rounding bottom pattern sets the AVAX price for a 48% jump.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a potential rally, the AVAX price could witness significant resistance at $22, $26, $30</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Avalanche coin is $447.2 Million, indicating a 33.4% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/0/01D9qkcV.png" alt="Avalanche Coin Price" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parabolic growth in Avalanche coin surged its market value by 90% from the January low of around $10.6. During this bull run, the prices breached multiple resistances, which later acted as a suitable footing, supporting the price rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, with the ongoing recovery rally and formation of a rounding bottom pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/avalanche/">AVAX price</a> has recently provided a massive breakout from the $20.2 ceiling. This breakout should intensify the bullish momentum and provides buyers additional support to prolong the recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, In the last two days, the daily chart showed a minor pullback which will validate the price sustainability above the newly reclaimed support. If the altcoin managed to sustain above the $20.2 mark, the post-retest rally could surge the prices 48% higher to hit the $30 mark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if the price witnessed an uncalled correction, the traders should look after the $20.2 and $18 support as their breakdown will weaken the bullish thesis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s</strong>: the 20-50-and-100-day EMA slope turned upward accentuates an early sign of trend reversal. Moreover, the 50 and 100 EMAs are on the verge of a bullish crossover, providing a buy signal for interest market participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI indicator</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI Slope</a> stays high into the bullish territory, projecting strong sentiment of bullish recovery.</span></p>

<h2>Yuga Labs Co-Founder Takes Leave</h2>
<p>Wylie revealed on his Twitter account that he has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure and would be taking a leave of absence from the company. Although, he has confirmed that he would remain a board member and strategic advisor to <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/yuga-labs/">Yuga Labs</a>, he will be absent from the company&#8217;s frontline action scene.</p>

<p>The NFT entrepreneur stated that he had pushed himself well beyond his capabilities on the project, putting in back-to-back 12-hour days of labor in an effort to seize a second chance at life after spending the majority of his twenties suffering a severe disease. His departure comes after the value of NFTs have declined, alongside a general downward trend seen in the pricing of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> following the aftermath of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/3ac/">3AC</a> collapse.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I won’t be on the frontlines for a while, I&#39;m incredibly excited for what the Yuga family has coming this year.</p>
<p>&mdash; GordonGoner.eth (Wylie Aronow) (@GordonGoner) <a href="https://twitter.com/GordonGoner/status/1619372819040829441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Wylie&#8217;s Growing Health Concerns</h2>
<p>While speaking on his health <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/GordonGoner/status/1619372819040829441" rel="nofollow">issue</a>, <span class="css-i9d31h"><span id="editable-content-within-article~0~0~0" class="css-x722s5">Wylie stated the </span></span>condition was &#8220;progressing pretty fast&#8221; which meant &#8212; he needed more time to make serious changes in his present lifestyle. He went on to say that his symptoms were still relatively minor, but that climbing the stairs tires him out, and that he is unable to play with his dog or engage in his normal routine of exercise. Despite this, he is able to go for walks, go out for trips, and live a life that is essentially pretty normal.</p>
<p>Wylie was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Symptoms started last year out of the blue and I put off seeking help (like an idiot) so I could keep working. But after testing, my doctor called and asked me to radically change my life.</p></blockquote>
<p>In December, the NFT titan announced that Activision Blizzard&#8217;s COO Daniel Alegre would shortly be joining Yuga Labs as the company&#8217;s new CEO. Yuga Labs claims that Daniel offers a considerable amount of experience in a variety of fields, including gaming, community building, development of commercial partnerships, and that he is eager to get started right away.</p>

After going missing for 5 years, it&#8217;s being <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/28/ruja-ignatova-found-alive-after-vanishing-5-years-ago/" rel="nofollow">reported</a> that the 42-year-old fraudster has been finally located in the heart of London city.</p>
<h2>OneCoin CEO Ruja Found</h2>
<p>In 2014, they initiated the process of presenting it to possible investors, offering a return of between 5 and 10 times the original investment and referring to their investors as &#8220;idiots&#8221; and &#8220;crazy.&#8221; And on October of 2017, the con artist disappeared entirely as law enforcement personnel closed in on her, and she wasn&#8217;t been seen since then. She is the only woman on the FBI&#8217;s most-wanted list at this time and has been added to their list of the top 10 most-wanted fugitives.</p>
<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023</em></a></p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s alleged that Ignatova surfaced early this month in order to stake a claim on one of her estates. After being listed for sale a few days ago with an initial asking price of $15.5 million, a penthouse apartment located in the London borough of Kensington, England, had its price reduced to $13.6 million. It is pretty apparent that Ignatova bought the property in the name of a corporation; nevertheless, due to a recently implemented rule, the complete name of the firm&#8217;s beneficiary must now also be provided.</p>
<h2>Ruja&#8217;s Growing Legal Troubles</h2>
<p>As a consequence of this, the attorneys who represent Ignatova have filed a legal claim on the property. They have listed her as the &#8220;beneficial owner&#8221; of the condominium in a filing that they have made with the financial regulator in the UK. The property was formerly owned by a business known as Abbots House Penthouse Limited, which had its headquarters in Guernsey, which is notorious for being a tax haven and having very lax governmental monitoring. Because of this, Ignatova has, up to this point, been omitted from both public records and land registry deeds.</p>
<p>When it came to light that Ignatova was connected to the home, the prestigious real estate company Knight Frank pulled the listing for the house almost immediately after it was published. Ignatova has been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, engage in money laundering and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. These charges were brought against her by the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/united-states" rel="nofollow">United States</a> Department of Prosecutions. She is one of just 11 women on the FBI&#8217;s most wanted list, which was first published in 1950 and contains a total of 529 individuals who have been given a special mention.</p>
<p>The authorities have even gone as far as offering a $100,000 reward for any information that would result in her capture. Moreover, they have issued a warning, indicating that Ignatova can undergo plastic surgery in order to alter her look.</p>

The emergence of this strong bullish continuation pattern indicates the coin price has a higher possibility of resuming the bullish time. Here’s how this bullish pattern could influence the Gala coin&#8217;s future price and how you can profit from it</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $0.07 would recuperate the bullish momentum for a higher recovery</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 50-and-100-day EMA brings more buying orders for GALA price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the GALA is $529 Million indicating a 26% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/c/CXzYergn.png" alt="GALA Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first two weeks of 2023, the GALA price witnessed a perpendicular growth which surged its market value 250% from the January 1st low($0.015). However, the bullish rally hit the $0.0558 monthly resistance and turned sideways immediately as market sentiment showed signs of exhausted bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last two weeks, the lateral walk showed several higher price rejection candles at this resistance, indicating the sellers are defending this level. However, in the 4-hour time frame, this consolidation phase shaped into an ascending triangle pattern.  </span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the coin price witnessed a significant inflow today and breached the $0.0558 neckline resistance of the triangle pattern. By the press time, the GALA price trades at $0.058 and shows a 10% intraday gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the daily candle closes above $0.057, this prior resistance will likely flip into suitable support to bolster a further bullish rally. Thus, the post-breakout rally may surge the GALA price 22% higher to hit the $0.0706 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the coin price continues to show signs of higher price rejection, a breakdown below the triangle pattern trendline will offset the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD(Blue)</a> and signal(orange) slopes offering positive crossover high in bullish territory indicate the aggressive buying activity in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the GALA price breached the 200-day EMA slope With the recent price jump, obtaining additional support for buyers to prolong the price rally. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">GALA Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.058</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>

In spite of the fact that there are a few bearish indications that occur along the levels of lower timeframes, bulls have nevertheless managed to maintain their dominant position.</p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Key Metric Hit ATH</h2>
<p>In the past several weeks, ETH has been on a tear, skyrocketing from a price of roughly $1,200 to a recent high of $1,568. This has been an incredible run for the crypto with the second-highest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time.">market capitalization</a>. Since the beginning of January 2023, the price has increased by more than 32%, and it is currently consolidating above important support levels. The trading volume for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> has dropped by more than 14% in the past twenty-four hours, which suggests that there is not a significant amount of purchasing pressure at the current levels.</p>

<p>However, the upgrade to Ethereum Shanghai is something that holders of ETH are eagerly awaiting because they anticipate it to propel the price of the coin to new heights in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>. It is expected that the Shanghai fork will become operational in March of 2023. And, according to the latest update, the total value in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ethereum-merge/">ETH 2.0</a> deposit contract just reached an all-time high of 15,513,575 ETH.</p>

<h2>Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge</h2>
<p>Now, this comes as a crucial metric, which determines the growing trust of market participants in the leading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> network. This, in turn, presents a bullish scenario for the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> king in the long-term prices. Also, on a lower timeframe, if the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a> comes out with more dovish rhetoric in response to the fact that some data points are indicating inflation to drop, a turnaround in the monetary policy could occur. That would <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/ethereum-price-prediction-eth-is-not-strong-enough-to-face-double-tops-for-now-202301281420" rel="nofollow">indicate</a> that the market was correct, and it would lead to an increase in people&#8217;s appetite for risky assets. The price of ETH could possibly break past $1,688 and even surge toward $1,928, but it might stop just short of the psychological $2,000 milestone.</p>

<p>This viewpoint has been echoed by industry stalwarts like Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto analyst, who is of the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1616802923022778369?s=20&amp;t=oP3O_zqNCg4dNLp_DMMLeA" rel="nofollow">opinion</a> that ETH can continue rallying towards $1,700-1,730 before facing any sort of rejection. Even pseudonymous trading guru, Rekt Capital, opines that Ethereum (ETH) price is inching closer to a massive breakout.</p>

Edward Kim" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic/">LUNC crypto price</a> showcases a textbook example of ascending triangle pattern in the daily time frame chart. The coin price has tested this pattern&#8217;s barrier multiple times, indicating the traders are strictly following this pattern. Thus, with a potential bullish breakout from the $0.0000185 neckline resistance, the prices are well likely to reach their predetermined target of this triangle pattern. Here&#8217;s how you can trade this pattern </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LUNC crypto price has entered a no-trading zone within the triangle pattern.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 20-and-50 EMA encourages the resumption of recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $105 Million, indicating a 65% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/H9VLTxZ4.png" alt="LUNC Crypto Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the emergence of an ascending triangle pattern is a sign of gradual growth in underline bullish momentum. During the pattern formation, the coin price shows a series of higher lows supported by a rising trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, this support trendline should bolster the buyers to breach the pattern&#8217;s neckline resistance and trigger a directional rally. By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-luna-and-terra-classic-lunc-price-to-witness-massive-rally/">LUNC crypto price</a> trades at $0.00017 and continues to wobble between the rising trendline and $0.000185 neckline resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the prices have nearly reached the peak of the triangle indicating the breakout opportunity is near. Therefore, considering the higher possibility,  a daily candle closing about the $0.000185 resistance will signal the release of trapped bullish momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This breakout will offer buyers a suitable footing for a strong recovery rally. Thus, in favorable bullish conditions, the post-breakout rally may surge the LUNC Crypto price 36% high to hit the $0.00025 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the contrary note, a breakdown below the support trendline will undermine the Bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> continues to waver above the midline, indicating the market sentiment remains bullish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger Band:</strong> the upward direction of the Bollinger Bands indicator reflects a sustained recovery in LUNC price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">LUNC Crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>

However, a minor pullback or sideways trend could be beneficial for these coins to recuperate the bullish momentum. Thus, today we will select the top three Defi coins that may rise significantly in February month.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche(AVAX)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/loQJ7gJT.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent recovery in the crypto market, the AVAX price was shaped into a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a>. This pattern formation itself is a sign of sustained recovery and provides several entry opportunities for interested traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 27th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/avalanche/">Avalanche coin price</a> witnessed a significant recovery and provided a massive breakout from the 200-day EMA and $20.2 neckline resistance of the aforementioned pattern. This breakout should intensify the bullish momentum and provides the buyer with a valid footing to lead a further recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In ideal bullish conditions, the post-breakout rally could shoot the AVAX price to the $30 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap(UNI)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/q/QY37BeOW.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 13th, the UNI coin price gave a bullish breakout from the long-coming trendline of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern.</a> However, even after reclaiming the downsloping trendline, the buyers continue to face strong rejection from the local resistance of $7-6.91.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/uniswap/">Uniswap coin price</a> trend shifted sideways and created a short consolidation phase below the $0.7 mark. Furthermore, this lateral walk could be a chance for coin buyers to replenish bullish momentum and resume the bull run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RSI slope revered from the overbought region but stays above the midline project the excessive buying is getting neutralized. Thus, a daily candle closing above $7 will signal the resumption of a bullish recovery, which could drive prices to the $7.8 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, as per the technical setup of the wedge pattern, the coin price should ride a sustained recovery to the $12.5 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainlink(LINK)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/o50YYcOf.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past nine months, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/chainlink/">Chainlink coin price</a> has resonated in a definite range stretched from $9.41 to $5.5. Thus, long-coming consolidation indicates the rangebound rally or rectangle pattern. Moreover, the coin price has reverted from the aforementioned levels multiple times, indicating the traders are strictly respecting this pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent recovery, the LINK price rebounded from the $5.5 support and rallied 31.5% since January 1st. Anyhow, the traders looking for an entry opportunity should wait for a bullish breakout from the $9.4 barrier, as it will be an entry sign of a bullish recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the bullish breakout could offer near term target of the $12.5 mark.</span></p>

However, positive sentiments emerging for the crypto industry are not the only possible reasons backing the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/new-resistance-breakout-sets-polygon-coin-on-10-upswing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MATIC price surge.</a> On-chain data suggest that a huge whale transaction may have resulted in a price jump here.</p>
<h2>Biggest MATIC movement of 2023</h2>
<p>As per the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1619169188819652608/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Santimet data</a>, the largest MATIC transfer of this year till now took place on January 25. This exchange came just before the recent 20% jump. It mentioned that 59 million MATIC (approx worth $56 million) were sent to the whale address at the bottom price level that day.</p>
<p>It added that the same whale address is also holding 585k <a href="https://coingape.com/how-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-will-impact-eth-holders-10025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> (approx worth $921 million). ETH is trading at an average price of $1579, at the press time. Ethereum price is up by 31% over the past 30 days.</p>
<p>However, WhaleAlert reported that a wallet tagged as Polygon was caught moving 9.7 million Polygon in multiple transactions. The whale wallet moved around $10.7 million worth of MATIC to an unknown wallet.</p>
<h2>Whales to dump Polygon?</h2>
<p>As we dig in, data shows that 30 million MATIC were moved in a single transaction. A whale address moved over $34.3 million worth of MATIC to Binance. This move suggests that whale is looking to sell off Polygon at a higher price in order to book more profit.</p>
<p>While whaleStats reported that Polygon landed on the tally of top 10 token used by trading volume among the biggest 500 BSC whales over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Polygon’s MATIC price has jumped by around 5% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $1.13, at the press time. However, its 24 hour trading volume has taken a hit of 28% to stand at $824 million.</p>
