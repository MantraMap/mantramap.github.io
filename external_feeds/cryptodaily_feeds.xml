			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has so far only given regulatory approval to 41 of the 300 crypto-related companies that have registered with the agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would rather seem as though the UK is just not the place for digital asset companies, given that the regulating watchdog is just too fierce for most projects to deal with.</p>
<p>And this is despite last year&rsquo;s announcement by the then Chancellor Rishi Sunak that the UK would become a world-leading crypto hub. Sunak is now the Prime Minister and still backs the plan, but if the regulatory environment is too harsh then who will come?</p>
<p>An announcement by the FCA today didn&rsquo;t give any hard reasons as to why so many crypto companies did not finish their registrations, or just outright failed to be approved. Instead, the statement highlighted what it considered a good quality application compared with a bad one.</p>
<p>In its statement, the FCA provided the following in its Background section to how the registration was set up:</p>

<p>The FCA has been the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) supervisor of UK cryptoasset businesses since 10 January 2020. Since then, we have received over 300 applications for registration under the MLRs and determined over 260 as of January 2023. Of the applications we determined, we approved and registered 41 (15%), 195 (74%) were either refused or withdrew their application and we rejected 29 (11%) submissions.</p>

<p>The following sections appeared to be incredibly exacting and demanding of a crypto company wishing to be registered in the United Kingdom. In fact, it might be imagined that only larger or exceptionally well organised or resourced companies would be able to comply with such a process.</p>
<p>The image of a crypto startup staffed by a handful of devs springs to mind. A lot of now successful crypto companies achieved success from these kinds of humble beginnings. It might be imagined that many crypto startups would travel a 1000 miles away from the UK not to have to submit to such a toilsome process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of these projects would likely be exactly the kind of fraudulent setups that the UK certainly doesn&rsquo;t need. However, some of them would potentially provide a lot of innovation and business for the UK. Surely some kind of middle ground can be found.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>🎍🎍 BAMBOOZLERS GARDEN 🎍🎍 CURRENT POPULATION: 5,274 🎍🎍</p>
<p>Years ago in a metaverse far away, an interspatial meteorite slammed into the pandaverse. The blast affected ~3000 pandas in the radius, causing them to grow more intelligent, suave and experimental.</p>
<p>Following their transformation, the affected pandas congregated in the most prestigious bamboo valley residing near Gooch Mountain. They became so much more intelligent that unaffected pandas shunned them, labeling them Bamboozlers. They eventually built a suave bamboo wall around their valley...the area now referred to as Bamboozlers Garden.</p>
<p>The Bamboozlers got so intelligent they started experimenting with alchemy and learned how to transmute new Bamboozlers through what they call "gm" (generative-manifestation). They managed 2274 successful gm's....4726 transmutations caught fire and burned</p>
<p>Bamboozlers have built an Experimental group testing new transmutations and exploring what other vibes the metaverse has to offer.</p>
<p>The total number of owners has reached 857.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest advantages of cryptocurrency is the range of passive income options.

<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">ApeCoin (APE) Offers Lucrative Investment Opportunities </p>
<p>ApeCoin (APE) was created by the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) developers and will be used to influence the future of the project. ApeCoin (APE) token holders will be able to vote on a number of policies, including how funds are allocated, changes in rules, future partnerships, projects to invest in, and much more. Once voted upon, a policy will be implemented by the ApeCoin (APE) Foundation. </p>
<p>The ApeCoin (APE) Foundation is the legal representative and is liable for the growth of the ApeCoin (APE) and BAYC ecosystem. The foundation has a governing body called the Board, consisting of five members who execute policies based on APE holder votes. </p>
<p>As well as voting, ApeCoin (APE) will also be used for features currently in development, such as games, where they can generate a passive income, events, and merchandise. ApeCoin (APE) has started 2023 with a surge in price of 60%, hitting monthly highs of $5.92. As the BAYC ecosystem continues to expand, the value of ApeCoin (APE) is likely to grow with it. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Offers Safe Startup Investment Opportunities To Retail Investors</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a unique DeFi project that uses blockchain technology to impact the crowdfunding industry. The current industry is unfavorable for startups, with only 5% of applicants ever receiving funding. Of those who receive funding, an even smaller percentage lasts long enough to make any profits. </p>
<p>With the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Launchpad, startups can raise funds without relying on venture capitalists. Once a startup has passed the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) vetting process, they can create and sell equity-backed NFTs, with each NFT representing a share (or multiple shares) in their business. </p>
<p>Instead of relying on a single venture capitalist, startups can raise funds by selling to a large pool of retail investors. Once they&rsquo;ve purchased an NFT, investors will store it in their decentralized Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) wallet. However, startups won&rsquo;t immediately receive their money. Instead, funds will be locked until the startup meets its funding targets. Once met, Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s (ORBN) &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; mechanism will be activated which releases funds or refunds investors if targets aren&rsquo;t met. </p>
<p>Investor safety plays an extremely important role throughout Orbeon Protocol (ORBN). ORBN token liquidity is locked for ten years and team tokens are locked for a year to prevent a rug pull. In addition, the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) smart contract has been audited by Solid Proof to guarantee the authenticity of the project. </p>
<p>Stage four of the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale has just started, with ORBN increasing in price from $0.0435 to $0.06. Investors who get in early will be able to stake their ORBN and earn a number of bonuses on the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Exchange, allowing them to build a passive income while profiting from ORBN price rises. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 23000:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 28 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to orbit the 23000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair encountered buying pressure around the 22540.76 area before running into selling pressure around the 23105.23 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure intensified below the 23194.61 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 48233.76 to 15460 and one that was initially absorbed when traders lifted BTC/USD as high as the 23824.66 area.&nbsp; This area represented the pair&rsquo;s strongest print since August 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notably, this new relative high represented a test of an upside price objective around the 23808 area that became technically significant when buying pressure strengthened around the 17927 area.&nbsp; Additional Stops were recently triggered above the 23375 and 23544 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 16326.16 area include the 25455, 25774, 27609, and 28004 levels.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 15460 area include the 23980, 24224, 26612, 26931, 29244, and 29639 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 22055, 20960, 20075, 19190, 18095, and 17930 levels.&nbsp; Stops are cited below the 21437, 20874, 20724, 20370, 20233, 20026, 19153, 18448, and 18253 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 22448.21 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 22913.07.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18390.99/ 16714.46/ 14500.15 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;23544.62/ 24224.60/ 25455.06 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to orbit the 23000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair encountered buying pressure around the 22540.76 area before running into selling pressure around the 23105.23 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure intensified below the 23194.61 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 48233.76 to 15460 and one that was initially absorbed when traders lifted BTC/USD as high as the 23824.66 area.&nbsp; This area represented the pair&rsquo;s strongest print since August 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notably, this new relative high represented a test of an upside price objective around the 23808 area that became technically significant when buying pressure strengthened around the 17927 area.&nbsp; Additional Stops were recently triggered above the 23375 and 23544 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 16326.16 area include the 25455, 25774, 27609, and 28004 levels.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to buying pressure around the 15460 area include the 23980, 24224, 26612, 26931, 29244, and 29639 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency lending takes many forms, but the core principles are intuitively understandable to anyone familiar with traditional bank loans. A lender provides a specific amount of crypto based on the borrower's collateral, and the customer repays the principal and interest at a predetermined rate. They are free to use the funds received in any way they like.</p>
<p>There are many uses for crypto loans. For example, one may buy goods or services, refinance existing debt, invest in business development, or purchase other cryptocurrencies expected to gain value.&nbsp;</p>
Why use crypto loans?&nbsp;
<p>Crypto loans benefit both lenders and borrowers. In the P2P model, lenders generate additional income from the funds they hold but do not use. They make their dormant holdings work and earn a yield that may be much higher than that on fiat bank deposits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For borrowers, these loans are quicker, more flexible, and more accessible than conventional services. They may get cash for everyday needs without credit checks or selling their crypto. Moreover, keeping ownership of the collateral means that future gains may eclipse the borrowing costs.&nbsp;</p>
Understanding crypto collateral
<p>As the crypto market is still experiencing growing pains, volatility may spike, and miscalculations may bring losses for both parties. To minimize such risks, crypto lenders require collateral &mdash; a safeguard adopted from conventional finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, unlike a consumer fiat loan, crypto loans are overcollateralized. Hence, an applicant must pledge funds whose value exceeds the amount they want to borrow. This proportion is determined by the LTV (Loan-to-Value) rate &mdash; for instance, 50% LTV means one may get an amount equal to half the value of their collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon full repayment, the customer gets their collateral back. Failure to pay the debt and/or maintain a certain LTV throughout the life of the loan results in liquidation &mdash; passing their collateral to the lender. &nbsp;</p>
Top 6 platforms
<p>Over the past few years, the crypto lending model has solidified, and the sector is growing rapidly. Exchanges and platforms have already issued loans worth millions. The teams running them are confident that crypto lending will only become more popular in the future due to such benefits as the absence of verifications and the opportunity to borrow fiat in a tax-free arrangement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many more startups could enter this promising market soon. Here is an overview of six prominent crypto loan platforms in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
YouHodler
<p>YouHodler is a trusted crypto lending platform offering a simple, secure, and transparent way to borrow and earn passive income on digital assets. Based in Switzerland, it offers crypto-backed loans in cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and fiat. The collateral options include 50 top cryptocurrencies.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>On YouHodler, one can apply for loans with a minimum amount of $100 and a repayment period of up to 364 days. The company also offers crypto savings accounts, trading solutions, and web and mobile wallets. As it accepts credit cards, stablecoins, and bank wires, moving funds into and out of their accounts is easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The YouHodler wallet app is free and intuitive. At press time, the wallet app supports 8 stablecoins and 52 cryptos. Generally, the fees and exchange rates are comparable with other platforms.</p>
<p>YouHodler's key advantages are a transparent legal setup, attractive yield rates, LTVs reaching 90%, and highly rated customer service. However, it is not available in the US due to legal restrictions, and the company could be more transparent about its profitability model. Finally, fiat transactions carry higher fees than other methods.</p>
CoinLoan
<p>CoinLoan is a pioneering crypto lending platform based in Tallinn, Estonia. A licensed financial institution regulated in the EU, it prides itself on its zero-incident track record. As the name suggests, crypto loans are the company's main focus, although it also offers interest accounts, an exchange, and a wallet working within its ecosystem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With enough collateral, borrowers can take out loans in fiat, stablecoins, and crypto. Moreover, fiat-to-crypto loans work both ways: one may choose fiat as the loan or the collateral currency. LTV rates reach 70%, while the duration ranges from one month to three years, with an opportunity to customize it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On CoinLoan, "everything is just one click away" thanks to an intuitive interface. As of this writing, loans are available in 15 different currencies, including BTC and ETH, leading stablecoins, EUR, and GBP. In addition, the deposit feature (fixed and flexible) supports over 20 assets, both digital and fiat. &nbsp;</p>
<p>CoinLoaners manage their funds in a trusted crypto management environment with multi-layer security, and the company is more open about its yield generation processes than before. Staking the company's own token (CLT) unlocks the most attractive yield rates, but this requirement may be viewed as a disadvantage.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto.com&nbsp;
<p>This prominent platform based in Singapore offers loans with LTV of up to 50% and customizable repayment schedules. Users may also reduce the interest rate by staking Cronos (CRO), the company's native token. After entering your deposit amount into the online calculator, you can see how much you can borrow, the annual percentage, and the monthly interest in USD.</p>
<p>Crypto.com is a well-established name in the crypto space, with over 70 million users in 90 countries. Aside from borrowing, customers can use an exchange, a DeFi wallet, and the Crypto Earn service bringing interest on 37+ cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The mobile app supports payments for goods and services, crypto transfers, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the downside, the lowest interest rates are only available to those who stake CRO. All cash-back rewards and other perks are also denominated in the native token.&nbsp;</p>
MakerDAO
<p>One of the most famous decentralized environments, MakerDAO, has a unique lending model. Its internal economics is based on two tokens &mdash; MKR and DAI. The latter is a stablecoin, the only loan currency whose value is supported by multiple mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon launch in 2017, the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) accepted only one collateral currency &mdash; Ether. Since then, it has become more versatile, and users may now pledge different Ethereum-based assets.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of loans in Dai is predictable value &mdash; the token has generally remained true to its soft peg to the US dollar. Therefore, wherever the crypto market goes, borrowers have peace of mind knowing that the amount they owe does not see-saw following dramatic bearish or bullish swings. &nbsp;</p>
Ledn
<p>Ledn is a Canadian crypto lending platform that helps you "experience the real-life benefits of your Bitcoin without having to sell it." Users can borrow dollars against Bitcoin, earn a yield on a savings account, or grow their Holdings using B2X loans that are available exclusively on Ledl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>B2X loans require BTC collateral worth $1,000 or more and come with an LTV rate of 50% and a maximum term of 12 months. The platform matches the collateral value, providing an amount twice as big. This feature combines a BTC-backed loan with buying an equal amount of BTC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once repayment is complete (users can repay earlier without penalty), the borrower gets their collateral and the newly purchased coins. Standard Ledl loans work similarly, but they may be denominated in USD, USDC, or the user's local currency.</p>
<p>As the platform is incorporated under the federal laws of Canada, its operations and security measures comply with local laws. On the downside, Ledl only supports two cryptocurrencies &mdash;Bitcoin and USDC, and the borrowing costs are above average. Combined with a 2% admin fee, the 9.9% annual interest rate brings the total costs to 11.9% APR. In addition, the USDC savings account has a withdrawal fee of 15 USDC.&nbsp;</p>
Drops
<p>Coins and tokens are not the only digital assets that can be turned to collateral for loans. Drops, a decentralized protocol focused on supporting the NFT economy, accepts collateral exclusively in non-fungible tokens. Pledged NFTs are accumulated in pools.</p>
<p>The Drops platform works with popular collections of digital art, including Bored Ape Ya and CryptoPunk. Even exotic collectibles are accepted. At press time, the LTV rate reaches 30%. There are no due dates, and users may also refinance existing loans at interest rates close to 0%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like other decentralized lenders, Drops operates without a human team, as all procedures are coded in smart contracts. However, it claims to have a "battle-tested foundation." The bug bounty program encourages the community to contribute to protocol security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Is it worth a try?
<p>The crypto loan industry is evolving and maturing, and the range of providers is growing daily. Crypto loans give quick access to new funds without credit checks, proof of income, or having to sell coins or tokens that may gain value. Therefore, those interested in innovative ways of passive income should take a closer look at this instrument.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that cryptocurrencies are still susceptible to market swings. Lenders that are less open about their internal procedures may pursue risky strategies putting customers' funds at risk. Thus, the availability of specific coins or tokens is one of many considerations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Borrowers should also weigh up the pros and cons of centralized and decentralized lending. Centralized platforms like CoinLoan comply with fund and data protection laws, while the DeFi landscape is largely unregulated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike CEXs conducting KYC and AML checks, decentralized finance relies on smart contracts &mdash; self-executing agreements with terms written in their code. DeFi interfaces may be confusing for newbies, but they can learn how smart contracts, oracles, and other innovative features work.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The DCG owned crypto exchange Luno, announced earlier this week that it would let go of 35% of its global workforce. </p>
<p>London-based cryptocurrency exchange, Luno, informed its employees on Wednesday that it is laying off 35% of its global workforce. According to Luno&rsquo;s LinkedIn profile, the business has about 960 employees, meaning that around 330 jobs will be affected. Reports by CNBC indicate that the firm&rsquo;s CEO, Marcus Swanepoel, informed employees of the redundancies via a live-streamed town hall. In an internal memo to CNBC, Swanepoel said:</p>

<p>2022 has been an incredibly tough year for the broader tech industry and, in particular the crypto market. Luno unfortunately hasn&rsquo;t been immune to this turbulence, which has affected our overall growth and revenue numbers.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Luno said that the layoffs will specifically affect Luno&rsquo;s marketing teams, adding that the redundancies would have &ldquo;minimal or no impact on key operating and compliance teams.&rdquo;</p>
Luno Becomes the Latest Victim of the FTX Collapse
<p>Headquartered in London, the exchange has offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg in South Africa, Singapore, Lagos, and Sydney and is part of the DCG conglomerate. DCG has been caught up in the fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried crypto empire, FTX, and DCG&rsquo;s lending arm, Genesis, filed for bankruptcy last week.</p>
<p>The crypto industry suffered a series of blows since the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD in May last year. In a memo shared with employees this week, Swanepoel said the crypto industry had seen a &ldquo;series of shocks,&rdquo; adding:</p>

<p>While we anticipated a downturn and proactively planned ahead with a business and funding model that can be resilient to some of these factors, the sheer scale and speed of all of this happening, and all at the same time, has put significant strain on our original plan.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that in addition to streamlining our strategy to focus on our core strengths, we need to also substantially decrease our cost base - which includes employee headcount in all of our markets - in order for us to be set up for success going forward.</p>

<p>In January 2023 alone, almost 11 crypto companies announced layoffs, amounting to nearly 2000 job losses.</p>
