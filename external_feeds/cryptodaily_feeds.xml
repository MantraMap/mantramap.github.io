			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Aave Companies has unveiled version two of its Lens Protocol and introduced several new features for the web3 social app.&nbsp;</p>
Lens Protocol Now Allows Blocking
<p>Lens Protocol&rsquo;s parent organization, Aave Companies, has launched the much-anticipated V2 of the web3 social app. This latest update takes Lens one step closer to its vision of creating an open and decentralized social media ecosystem focusing on composability, value sharing, and enhanced features.</p>
<p>One notable addition is the on-chain blocking feature, which allows Lens users to block each other, similar to Twitter's. Once blocked, users will be restricted from commenting, following, quote-commenting, and utilizing unique crypto-specific features such as mirror and collect.</p>
New Features To Support Monetization
<p>With monetization as one of the key pillars supporting the V2 upgrade, several new features have been geared toward allowing users to generate revenue. For example, the &ldquo;collect&rdquo; feature allows users to accumulate and store content on Lens as NFTs. There is also an equivalent feature to that of a retweet - Mirror. A &ldquo;mirrored&rdquo; piece of content will generate revenue, with users who have mirrored the content also receiving a portion of the earnings.</p>
<p>According to the statement from Aave founder Stani Kulechov,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Lens Protocol V2 takes decentralized social media and monetization opportunities to a new leve. Providing maximum flexibility for builders, V2 enables new types of social engagements and monetization relationships, where all stakeholders can share in the value of social networks&mdash;both individually and collectively as an ecosystem."</p>
V2 Continues Open Design Space
<p>Although the initial iteration of the social platform did not include a user interface, it had sufficient tools and supportive architecture for developers to build their own consumer apps in the Lens ecosystem. As a result, numerous social media apps stemmed from the platform, like Lenster, Orb, and Buttrfly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the developer community on the platform has also created multiple tools like algorithms that predict follower growth to search operations to find new friends and content. This characteristic open design space will continue on V2, allowing developers to execute external actions directly on the platform and build innovative projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recent introduction of the Momoka data scalability solution and V2&rsquo;s Lens Improvement Proposals (LIPs) will further enhance the platform&rsquo;s scalability and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
Profiles Get An Upgrade
<p>The latest iteration of the web3 social app is also focusing on upgrading the profiles themselves. Since V2 has transitioned the profiles to the ERC-6551 standard from the previous ERC-721, they now function like crypto wallets, allowing users to transact and store cryptocurrencies along with NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lens Protocol is also delving deeper into crypto-native actions, like creating pathways for builders to join DAOs or directly donate to public goods through investing in content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these new features and improvements, Lens Protocol V2 seeks to carve out its niche in the social media landscape, providing users with a decentralized and crypto-powered platform that offers increased engagement, monetization opportunities, and compatibility with the evolving web3 ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto world eagerly awaits as Litecoin's third halving event approaches. Expected for August 2, 2023, this event will occur once the 2,520,000th block is mined.&nbsp;</p>
What is the halving?
<p>A &ldquo;halving&rdquo; in the crypto context refers to the moment when the reward miners receive for validating transactions on the blockchain is cut by half. This means that miners will earn half the number of new coins for each block they mine, which, in the past, has significantly impacted the cryptocurrency's value.</p>
<p>The event has historically triggered significant movements in Litecoin's value, often preceding similar movements in Bitcoin. This has led some to speculate that Litecoin's performance could be a precursor to Bitcoin's future movements.</p>
Halving expectations
<p>Litecoin's halving occurs approximately every 840,000 blocks, which takes around four years. Since its inception in 2011, Litecoin has already experienced two halvings. During these events, the rewards given to miners are reduced, which has led to an increase in Litecoin's value.</p>
<p>Historical data from previous halvings in various cryptocurrencies may serve as a basis for this expectation. However, sceptics argue that market participants are already aware of the halving event and have factored it into their price calculations and strategies. In this view, the halving&rsquo;s effects may have been &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; ahead of time, meaning that any potential price impact has already been reflected in the current market value.</p>
<p>As we approach the third halving event, it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect increased market attention and potential price volatility. Holders and potential investors will be keeping a close eye on Litecoin as it approaches and then passes the halving.&nbsp;</p>
Will the halving push Litecoin higher this time?
<p>Many Litecoin holders will hope that this next halving will help to provide the spark that pulls LItecoin out of its current range bound price action. Right now, it appears that Litecoin has in fact managed to turn an incredibly important resistance at $91 into support. Sitting just above the 50 and 200 day moving averages should also provide a reliable cushion. A lift off for Litecoin from here could take it to the next strong resistance at $140.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>US Judge Sarah Netburn has ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple to agree to possible settlement dates should both parties believe them to be constructive at this stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following Judge Netburn&rsquo;s order, several members of the XRP community have speculated that both parties will settle soon.&nbsp;</p>
New Settlement Order&nbsp;
<p>The order came shortly after Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York referred the next phase of the court proceedings in the Ripple vs. SEC suit to Judge Netburn. Court documents filed on the 17th of July reveal that Judge Netburn will be presiding over the General Pretrial. The judge indicated that the concerned parties reach an agreement regarding settlement dates 6-8 weeks beforehand, pointing to the court&rsquo;s hectic schedule. The judge&rsquo;s order stated that the parties involved in the matter must agree to three mutually convenient dates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NEW: Judge Sarah Netburn orders both @Ripple and the @SECGov to agree on 3 mutually convenient dates to schedule a settlement conference, &ldquo;if they believe it to be productive at this time.&rdquo; Also recommends scheduling 6-8 weeks beforehand due to the court&rsquo;s busy schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The order also stated that the court would not agree to or tolerate any last-second requests for settlement conferences and also told the parties not to expect any adjournments on litigation deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
Do Ripple And The SEC Want To Settle?&nbsp;
<p>The pretrial phase includes aspects of the matter pertaining to scheduling, discovery, and non-dispositive pretrial motions. It is also the stage when most parties in a case would look to settle instead of going to trial. While many believe that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would want Ripple to settle, the coming few days will reveal if either side wishes to take the settlement route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eleanor Terrett, business journalist at Fox, shared her outlook, stating that Judge Netburn&rsquo;s order does not mean a settlement would occur within the next 6 to 8 weeks, noting that the order only pertains to the parties scheduling a settlement conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be clear: Judge Netburn is suggesting that both sides agree on some possible dates for a settlement meeting, *IF* &ldquo;they believe it to be productive at this time. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll see a settlement in 6-8 weeks. It means that if they do decide on a date, it will have to be scheduled 6-8 weeks in advance of the desired date due to the court&rsquo;s busy schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also added that both sides could also refuse to schedule a settlement conference or fail to reach an agreement within the stipulated time frame. Terrett has been following the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit since the beginning of the case.&nbsp;</p>
Pro-XRP Lawyer Believes Conference Will Be Scheduled&nbsp;
<p>Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli stated that he believes that Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission will schedule the settlement conference in a bid to avoid angering the court. However, he also stated that the conference would end just like how the previous meetings ended, with both sides failing to reach a compromise acceptable to each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will likely schedule one so as not to anger the court. But it will go about as well as the last two settlement conferences before it went. Settlement only happens when both parties finally reach the compromise each can stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If what Rispoli believes would play out, then one or both parties could also appeal Judge Torres&rsquo; summary decision. In a landmark ruling, Judge Torres effectively stated that XRP was not a security, triggering a massive rally for the token and the larger crypto market. While the outcome of the case is still up in the air, market watchers believe that Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory is a critical moment and could help in formulating much-needed regulatory clarity in the US crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reacting to the judgment, the Securities and Exchange Commission stated at the time that it was still assessing the order and would identify its next course of action.</p>

<p>As per the exchange, the termination happened because the AFA failed to comply with partnership obligations.</p>
Partnership Background
<p>Binance and AFA went into business in AFA, with the former becoming the official naming sponsor of the country's national football team. The deal was for a five-year partnership, generating significant buzz in the crypto space. However, things started to sour after the AFA allegedly failed to fully comply with its partnership obligations leading to the dissolution. As per Binance, the AFA's non-compliance conflicted with their business values and partnership principles.</p>
<p>Wu Blockchain tweeted:</p>

<p>"Binance has terminated its five-year partnership with the Argentine soccer association, just after a year, citing a breach of contract. The move comes at a time when Binance is cutting staff and employee benefits. In January 2022, Binance became the main sponsor of Argentina&rsquo;s national soccer team."</p>

More Troubles For Binance
<p>Binance is currently going through challenging times after news came out that they have reportedly laid off several staff members after a number of executives left the firm. Apparently, more than 1,000 staff members were let go over the past few weeks. It should be noted that Binance CEO CZ has tweeted that the numbers reported were grossly inaccurate.</p>
AFA's Crypto Partnership
<p>The Binance partnership was far from AFA&rsquo;s first crypto rodeo. Previously, the AFA had partnered with global exchange ByBit as its main sponsor. The AFA had also partnered with the likes of&nbsp;Upland, and BC.GAME.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with price fluctuations often sparking excitement and concern among investors. In this article, we examine the recent price drop of Litecoin (LTC) and the surge of Tradecurve, which has remained a favorite presale among investors.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Litecoin (LTC) Sees a Bearish Downturn</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has witnessed a recent price drop, causing concern among its bulls. In the last week alone, Litecoin saw a drop of 14.5% on the price charts. The decline in Litecoin's value can be attributed to various factors, including overall market sentiment and profit-taking by traders.</p>
<p>Litecoin has a value of $94.30 with a market cap of $6.9B, which is a drop of 2.43% in the last 24 hours. Not only that, the technical analysis for Litecoin also paints a bearish picture, with both its technical indicators and moving averages showing strong sell signals.</p>
<p>To predict how the current conflict between the bulls and the bears will turn out, traders are now paying particular attention to the $90-$92 price range. If it falls below that range, Litecoin may continue dropping to its support level of $85.</p>
<p class="s8">Tradecurve (TCRV) Seen As the Top Pick Among Investors</p>
<p>In contrast to Litecoin's downturn, the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale has experienced a surge in price, solidifying its position as a favorite among investors. The recent 20% surge in Tradecurve's price reflects growing confidence and interest from the investor community.</p>
<p>A 40% surge is also expected to come by the end of July, as another stage begin. Traders and investors find value in Tradecurve's borderless trading platform, which solves issues like lack of transparency and limited access to advanced trading tools.</p>
<p class="s8">Benefitting Both Experienced and Novice Traders</p>
<p>Tradecurve will be a unique trading platform with a hybrid infrastructure model. &nbsp;It will place the best features of CEX and DEX on one platform. Low latency, slippage-free trading, and anonymity through its DeFi capabilities will all be present on Tradecurve.</p>
<p>Users from all over the globe may trade all derivatives on one account in complete privacy. This is because Tradecurveremoves the intrusive sign-up KYC checks that platforms like Coinbase employ.</p>
<p>Another aspect that differentiates Tradecurve from Coinbase is that it will implement a Proof of Reserves - preventing any FTX-style collapse. The platform's innovative features have attracted over 12,500 traders seeking enhanced trading experiences. They include high-leverage options, account VIP service, and the ability to subscribe to automated AI trading bots.</p>
<p class="s8">A Promising Outlook</p>
<p>Behind all Tradecurve features and ecosystem components lie the platform's native token, TCRV. Currently, the project is in Stage 4 of its presale and has a value of $0.018, a stunning 80% surge from its starting price of $0.01.</p>
<p>Holding this token brings access to VIP status, governance voting rights, staking rewards, and more. With millions of tokens sold already and a $3.2M raised, experts forecast a 50xvalue jump before the presale ends - so do not miss out, sign up for the TCRV presale below and become an early investor in an upcoming Binance rival.</p>

<p class="s7">Aptos (APT): Partnering with Chingari for a New Era in Blockchain Technology</p>
<p>Aptos (APT) emerges as an innovative blockchain technology, pushing the boundaries of possibility.</p>
<p>A notable milestone for Aptos (APT) comes from a recent partnership with Chingari, a renowned on-chain social app. This collaboration paves the way for a new era in decentralized social media platforms.</p>
<p>With its current price at $8.84, Aptos (APT) exhibits promising growth potential. Analysts project a trading range of $13.50 to $15.80 for Aptos (APT) by Q4 2023, presenting investors with exciting opportunities for profitability in the upcoming months.</p>
<p class="s7">Ripple (XRP) Faces Legal Battle with SEC: Potential Price Surge and Expert Predictions</p>
<p>Ripple (XRP), the blockchain-based payment protocol, faced legal challenges from the SEC in 2020. Instead of settling, Ripple (XRP) decided to fight the charges, setting it apart from its peers.</p>
<p>Experts cautiously anticipate a potential price surge for Ripple (XRP), with a predicted valuation of $3.84 shortly after the court's decision. However, a more conservative estimate suggests a target price of $2.50 by late 2023 or early 2024.</p>
<p class="s7">Lido DAO (LDO) Emerges as DeFiPowerhouse</p>
<p>Lido DAO (LDO) has gained popularity as a DeFi platform, allowing users to earn interest on their investments. Its innovative strategies, including yield farming and Ethereum staking services, have fueled rapid growth.</p>
<p>Lido DAO (LDO)'s price has surged over 100% this year. Analysts predict a breakout before Q3 2023, with a potential minimum price of $4.25.</p>
<p class="s7">IOTA (MIOTA) Witnesses Impressive Price Surge on Shimmer EVM Testnet Success</p>
<p>IOTA (MIOTA) recently experienced an impressive 13% surge in its price, driven by successful testnet trials of its Shimmer EVM.</p>
<p>The Shimmer EVM is a decentralized computer capable of executing many projects and acts as the underlying virtual machine for Ethereum's operating structure.</p>
<p>As of the latest update, IOTA (MIOTA) is trading at $0.209090, with a 24-hour trading volume of $38,709,452. These figures indicate a growing interest and activity surrounding the token.</p>
<p>While the future remains uncertain, predictions suggest that IOTA (MIOTA) may reach approximately $0.35 by 2023.</p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx (WERX): Revolutionizing the Freelance Marketplace</p>
<p>Uwerx stands at the forefront of the freelance industry, armed with confidence and a bold vision for the future. By introducing groundbreaking features, engaging with the community, and continuously improving its platform, Uwerx is set to redefine how freelancers and clients connect and collaborate.</p>
<p>Uwerx is poised to disrupt the status quo with its competitive transaction fee structure. Setting a new industry standard, the platform will charge a mere 1% transaction fee, positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to established players like Upwork and Fiverr, which charge significantly higher fees.</p>
<p>The Uwerx team values decentralization and aims to make the platform community-driven. Upon the project's launch on centralized exchanges, the contracts will be renounced, minimizing taxes and empowering users with greater control over their investments.</p>
<p>Uwerx, the groundbreaking platform set to transform the freelance industry, is rapidly approaching its highly anticipated launch. As part of the pre-launch excitement, the Uwerx team has scheduled a Test Airdrop, which will take place on July 31st, marking a significant milestone for the project.</p>
<p>Upholding transparency and security, Uwerx is committed to ensuring the safety of its users' funds. To this end, the liquidity will be locked well before the end of the presale, providing peace of mind to early investors and supporters.</p>
<p>The success of Uwerx's presale is evident as it completed stages 1 to 4 in record time. This impressive achievement showcases the strong demand and unwavering support for the project. The Uwerx presale has reached its fifth stage, offering tokens at an attractive price of $0.05245 per token and a generous 25% bonus on every purchase ending today at 18:00 UTC. This enticing opportunity has attracted a dedicated community eager to be part of Uwerx's success.</p>
<p>In an exciting development, Uwerx has introduced the UwerxVault, allowing users to store their WERX tokens and participate in the staking mechanism. Users can earn rewards based on platform variables by staking their tokens for varying durations, fostering an ecosystem that incentivizes active engagement.</p>
<p>Upholding the utmost security and reliability standards, Uwerxhas undergone rigorous audits conducted by SolidProof and InterFi Network. These audits instill confidence in the community, assuring users that robust systems safeguard their investments. Uwerx's prominence continues to grow as it secures listings on renowned platforms. The project has successfully been listed on CoinSniper and is set to debut on Uniswap by August 1st, providing increased accessibility and liquidity for token holders.</p>
<p>This growing community signifies the widespread interest in Uwerx's innovative approach to the freelance marketplace. Adapting to the needs and desires of the community, the Uwerxteam has modified token allocations, ensuring a fair distribution of rewards and aligning with the enthusiastic response from early supporters.</p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx (WERX) Alpha Platform Gets Beta</p>
<p>Demonstrating its commitment to delivering a cutting-edge platform, Uwerx has released the first version of its Alpha platform. This milestone signifies the team's dedication to meeting their goals and promises, and further iterations of the platform are expected to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>The Alpha platform is merely the beginning for Uwerx as the team prepares to transition to the Beta version. This evolution will introduce many new features and improvements, solidifying Uwerx's position as a frontrunner in the freelance industry.</p>
<p>Uwerx continues to share exciting updates with its community, recently releasing a comprehensive PDF detailing various aspects of the Alpha platform. From signing up and logging in to job creation and finding talent, these ten pages provide a glimpse into the user-friendly interface and powerful functionalities that await users.</p>
<p>User feedback is crucial to Uwerx's ongoing development, and the team encourages users to share their thoughts and suggestions at feedback@uwerx.network. By actively engaging with the community, Uwerx ensures that its platform evolves to meet the ever-changing needs of freelancers and clients alike. As Uwerx progresses toward its launch, the value of its native token, WERX, is set to increase.</p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx (WERX) Price Prediction&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx's extraordinary growth trajectory sets the stage for an exhilarating ride, propelling WERX tokens to unprecedented heights. Our estimations suggest a meteoric rise to $1.32 by Q1-Q2 2024, followed by an astonishing surge to $2.97 by Q3 2024. These projections underscore Uwerx's immense potential, solidifying it as a must-have investment for astute investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Autentic, the ecosystem of digital financial assets, has announced its native token AUt presale for institutional and private funds, partners, and investment companies. It is scheduled for September 1st and will last only a few weeks. During this period, major investors will have the opportunity to buy AUt at a special price of $0.20.</p>

<p>"At the initial token sale stage, we focus on large institutional and private investors, as well as on our partners who have supported the project development. They will get special purchase terms with a minimum vesting period of 9 months. We also limit the average trade within $3,000 and the number of presale participants,&rdquo; stated the company.</p>

<p>In total, Autentic plans to issue 100 million AUt, which will be used as an internal settlement for accessing platform services, paying fees, and serving as an investment instrument. The company will launch a Savings feature in the fall, providing the opportunity to earn up to 25% APY. Other benefits the company provides to its investors: predictable investment returns, 24/7 trading, low fees, and full decentralization without regulatory pressure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the end of this year we plan to launch Autentic Pay payment system, Autentic Capital platform for Security Token Offerings (STO) and initial asset offerings, Autentic Market - a marketplace for digital assets. In 2024, the company will list AUt on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and launch decentralized platform Block DEX &nbsp;for secondary asset trading,&rdquo; shared the company.</p>

<p>In the near future, the release of the following digital assets will be available to users:</p>
<p>Autentic DAO token (ADT), EIP-20 token that essentially serves as a match to company shares. It grants holders the right to receive distributed profits from &nbsp;ecosystem activities and participate in decision-making processes that determine the overall direction of the company development. A total of 2.5 million ADT tokens will be released. But there will be no public sale for these tokens.</p>
<p>AUtentic Gold (AuG), EIP-20 token - a digitized version of real gold, pegged to the precious metal quotes on Shanghai Stock Exchange. Token holders can have the opportunity to get gold bars from 1000 grams at the offices of partner banks.</p>
Currency tokens
<p>Within the Autentic ecosystem, currency tokens of BRICS, SCO, and EAEU countries will be released following EIP-20 standard. These tokens will reflect the amount of fiat currency held in Autentic bank accounts in various currency locations. These tokens will be released at 1:1 ratio based on Proof of Reserves (PoR) consensus, combined with financial audits that serve as a proof of financial funds corresponding to the number of issued tokens in Autentic accounts. Currency tokens will be utilized as key components in creating smart contracts within Autentic ecosystem. They will serve for internal accounting, calculation and investment in the system, facilitating fund transfers and payment procedures via Autentic PAY. Deposit, withdrawal, exchange and redemption of currency tokens for real funds will be made via smart contracts.</p>
The ecosystem will also include:
<p>Autentic DAO, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where participants can vote for particular decision-making, ecosystem development and receive distributed profits from company activities.</p>
<p>Autentic Capital, platform for initial listing of crypto assets, equity raising for issuing companies in Autentic platform, investing in promising projects and businesses.</p>
<p>Autentic Market, marketplace for real digitized goods and services that can be purchased using currency and metal tokens like RUR.s, CNY.s, SAR.s, AuG, or any other currency tokens representing BRICS, SCO, and EAEU countries available on the platform.</p>
<p>Autentic PAY, blockchain payment system, designed for fund transferring and without fee transactions, using any cryptocurrencies, approved for circulation within Autentic ecosystem, as well as issued currency tokens based on Proof of Reserves (PoR) protocol and pegged to real fiat currencies held in company accounts.</p>
<p>Autentic ID, unique system for verifying transactions and confirming identity with the built-in rating system based on SoulBound technology.</p>

The integration of Portal DEX will make cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and other digital assets fast, secure, and private.&nbsp;</p><p>With this, LFG users will be able to purchase the Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens using assets from other chains such as Ethereum without bridges or custodians.

With DEXes gaining a stronger foothold in the crypto industry, the interest in NFTs on Bitcoin is only expected to shoot up in the future.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With bitcoin flat and slightly down on the day, the same could be said of the altcoins, with the exception of just a few.</p>
A flat bitcoin
<p>Bitcoin remains in its sideways accumulation as it has done for the last three days. The market is waiting for that next big move, and whether this is to the upside or the downside is still to be decided.</p>
<p>The fact that the king of the cryptocurrencies made another higher high is all to the good, and even if there is a dip to $28,000 or thereabouts a higher low will have easily been put in.</p>
Others.D
<p>The high end of the crypto market has had a flat day so far, but this is not the case for certain altcoins lower down. The Others.Dominance chart is the market cap of cryptos excluding the top ten cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This chart is 13.3% up for the day so far compared with slightly negative percentages for other Total market caps. So with such a good move to the upside for this section of the market, which were the alts that made the most percentage gains?</p>
$SUSHI
<p>Sushi ($SUSHI), one of the main competitors to Uniswap, has put on 11.9% thus far. A double bottom looks to have been found at $0.48, and today&rsquo;s rise to $0.76 has met $0.80 but has since returned to hopefully flip resistance into support at $0.76.</p>
$CELO
<p>Celo ($CELO), the mobile, carbon negative, EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystem has also risen just over 11% up to now. The decent move upwards here is probably due to the announcement that Celo devs will migrate the blockchain from a layer1 to a layer2-based on OP stack, improving security and bringing more use cases to ethereum.</p>
<p>Celo has found its own double bottom which fell as far as $0.34. An uptrend has still not formed, but a range between $0.41 and $0.91 is currently being adhered to.</p>
$1INCH
<p>1inch ($1INCH), another decentralised swaps exchange like Sushi and Uniswap, was perhaps the biggest mover of the day, reaching $0.59, which equated to a 36.8% rise before retracing nearly all of those gains back down at $0.43. This surge came on the back of a 29% growth over the previous two days, so perhaps traders decided to take profits on this one.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks, the crypto market has traveled through a bumpy road, with its fair share of ups and downs. For one, Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have introduced new updates to improve their shaky position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, Tradecurve (TCRV) launch has captured a lot of attention. This new project has become an instant hit due to its uniqueness, and enormous growth potential. Its ongoing presale has broken records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Cardano&rsquo;s (ADA) Network Activity Falls
<p>The Cardano (ADA) community is hopeful that the recent developments in its ecosystem, including the release of a novel Dynamic P2P networking scheme, will increase the traction on the network. Dynamic P2P has been launched to bring scalability and modularity to the Cardano network. However, experts have raised concerns over the latest on-chain data related to Cardano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per Santiment&rsquo;s data, the number of daily active addresses on the Cardano network has plummeted by 71% in the past month. The social dominance of Cardano has also taken a hit. Subsequently, the exchange rate of Cardano has suffered a drop of 23% in the last 30 days. At press time, Cardano is available to change hands at $0.29.</p>
<p></p>
Solana (SOL) Aims To Benefit From Firedancer
<p>To get out of the clutches of bears, and prevent its price from falling further, Solana (SOL) has shifted its focus to the NFT space. This shift in focus has come as Solana has taken a dip of 11% in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the current exchange rate of Solana is $19.19, which is 93% below its peak of $260.06. However, the new validator client for Solana, Firedancer, is expected to provide market support to SOL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the data from Messari, Firedancer can lower latency times on the Solana network, enhancing DeFi maturity. This, in turn, will enable faster transaction processing on Solana, attracting more users to the network. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out the declining TVL of Solana.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve Presale Becomes More Appealing With 50x Growth
<p>According to data, about 5 new cryptocurrencies enter the market every day, and there are more than 26,000 digital currencies in circulation. Subsequently, crypto trading has also boomed. However, existing crypto exchanges have been criticized for their high fees, limited investment options, and data insecurity. To address these issues, and meet dynamic market demands, Tradecurve (TCRV) has launched a disruptive crypto exchange.</p>
<p>This new Web3 trading platform enables users to invest in different markets, such as forex, equity, cryptocurrency, CFDs, and more, with a single account. What is more exciting for traders is the platform&rsquo;s privacy feature. It does not require users to fulfill any KYC requirements. Contrary to this, exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood mandate users to share their private details.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform boasts high-leverage trading that starts from 500:1, and a VIP account service. It will also provide traders with distributed liquidity, and non-custodial storage to enhance their trading experience. The Metaverse Trading Academy is another remarkable feature of this platform. Through the academy, users can learn better and more profitable trading strategies.</p>
<p>The presale round of the platform is live, and a TCRV token is available to purchase for $0.018, an 80% increase from the launch price. Experts forecast that the tokens will record 50x gains during the presale round, and 100 times growth after their launch on tier-1 exchanges.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks, the crypto market has traveled through a bumpy road, with its fair share of ups and downs. For one, Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have introduced new updates to improve their shaky position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, Tradecurve (TCRV) launch has captured a lot of attention. This new project has become an instant hit due to its uniqueness, and enormous growth potential. Its ongoing presale has broken records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Cardano&rsquo;s (ADA) Network Activity Falls
<p>The Cardano (ADA) community is hopeful that the recent developments in its ecosystem, including the release of a novel Dynamic P2P networking scheme, will increase the traction on the network. Dynamic P2P has been launched to bring scalability and modularity to the Cardano network. However, experts have raised concerns over the latest on-chain data related to Cardano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per Santiment&rsquo;s data, the number of daily active addresses on the Cardano network has plummeted by 71% in the past month. The social dominance of Cardano has also taken a hit. Subsequently, the exchange rate of Cardano has suffered a drop of 23% in the last 30 days. At press time, Cardano is available to change hands at $0.29.</p>
<p></p>
Solana (SOL) Aims To Benefit From Firedancer
<p>To get out of the clutches of bears, and prevent its price from falling further, Solana (SOL) has shifted its focus to the NFT space. This shift in focus has come as Solana has taken a dip of 11% in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the current exchange rate of Solana is $19.19, which is 93% below its peak of $260.06. However, the new validator client for Solana, Firedancer, is expected to provide market support to SOL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the data from Messari, Firedancer can lower latency times on the Solana network, enhancing DeFi maturity. This, in turn, will enable faster transaction processing on Solana, attracting more users to the network. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out the declining TVL of Solana.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve Presale Becomes More Appealing With 50x Growth
<p>According to data, about 5 new cryptocurrencies enter the market every day, and there are more than 26,000 digital currencies in circulation. Subsequently, crypto trading has also boomed.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, two significant developments have taken center stage, capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. InQubeta (QUBE) stands out as a revolutionary cryptocurrency, seamlessly integrating the realms of crypto, AI technology, and profitability. Simultaneously, Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a remarkable surge in market performance, fueled by the accumulation of over $4.7 billion worth of Bitcoin by whales and institutional investors.</p>
<p class="s5">The success of InQubeta's ongoing live presale, coupled with its diverse ecosystem encompassing high-profit potential and popular NFTs, makes InQubeta poised for 1000% growth in 2023. This projected growth is also thanks to InQubeta's focus on facilitating the crowdfunding of AI startups and providing a secure, transparent, and rewarding platform for every investor.</p>
<p class="s5">Let's explore how InQubeta is poised for 1000% growth in 2023 while whales and institutional investors acquire over $4.7 billion of Bitcoin.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE) Effectively Leverages Crypto, Profitability, and AI Synergy
<p class="s5">InQubeta is an outstanding crypto platform that highlights blockchain technology and AI innovation. It facilitates the connection between AI startups and investors to actualize its fundraising mission for beginner AI companies. The second stage of the ongoing InQubetapresale is witnessing remarkable momentum, attracting many investors eager to acquire QUBE tokens at a market-friendly rate of $0.0098 per token. InQubeta has sold over 174 million QUBE tokens and raised over $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="s5">InQubeta's high-profit guarantee convinces investors of its capability to experience 1000% growth before the end of 2023. InQubeta aims to maximize returns and provide enticing rewards for investors in the DeFi market. InQubeta's native QUBE coin operates on a deflationary model, strategically reducing its supply to instill a sense of exclusivity and scarcity among QUBE token holders, encouraging them to hold their tokens for future gains. Holding QUBE tokens presents an opportunity to accrue 300% profits on investments due to the appreciating value of the QUBE coin throughout the presale.</p>
<p class="s5">InQubeta's engaging NFT marketplace contributes to its potential to grow by 1000% in 2023. This virtual marketplace serves as a space for AI startups to exhibit their curated collections of popular NFTs. The unique NFTs attract QUBE investors to actively support their preferred AI startups by purchasing NFT assets. As an incentive, AI startups can offer discounts on products and services or rewards as equity-based NFTs, further solidifying InQubeta's reputation as one of the best DeFi investment prospects.</p>
<p class="s8"></p>
Bitcoin (BTC) Rises in Value Following a Surge in Accumulation
<p class="s5">Bitcoin utilizes its native BTC token to enable secure peer-to-peer transactions. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has gained immense popularity as a pioneering crypto project many cryptocurrencies imitate. Between late June and July 4, 2023, whales and institutional investors in the BTC cryptocurrency actively amassed billions of dollars of Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. Their holdings ranged from 10 to 10,000 BTC, totaling over 154,600 BTC and yielding over $4.7 billion.</p>
<p class="s5">This surge in accumulation occurred after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed for a spot in the Bitcoin project's exchange-traded fund (ETF). Afterward, the BTC token recorded heightened trading activity, propelling the price of each Bitcoin to rise above $31,000, reaching a new yearly high. Renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo has speculated that this progressive price trend may lead to the value of the BTC token possibly surpassing $300,000 in the future.</p>
Conclusion
<p class="s5">Investors and enthusiasts in the DeFi market are intrigued by the rapid accumulation of Bitcoin by whales and institutional investors and the promising growth of InQubeta's QUBE coin. The influx of billions of dollars into Bitcoin's funding showcases the continued interest and confidence in the leading cryptocurrency, with price predictions reaching new highs. Conversely, InQubeta's unique combination of crypto, profitability, and AI technology positions it as one of the best DeFi cryptocurrencies, with a projected growth of 1000% in 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its finalized global regulatory framework for crypto assets. </p>
<p>On Monday, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its recommendations for a global regulatory framework for crypto-assets to &ldquo;promote the comprehensiveness and international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches.&rdquo;</p>
FSB Bases Framework on Principle of &ldquo;Same Activity, Same Risk, Same Regulation&rdquo; &nbsp;
<p>The FSB is an international organization that monitors the global financial system. The organization published guidelines for a global approach to crypto-related activities.</p>
<p>The board was tasked by the Group of 20 Nations (G20) to coordinate the delivery of an effective regulatory, supervisory and oversight framework for crypto-assets in light of recent events that took place in the digital asset industry.</p>
<p>The G20 previously said in a document summarizing the outcomes of meetings held with finance ministers and central bank governors that the FSB, IMF (International Monetary Fund), and BIS (Bank for International Settlements) are to deliver papers and recommendations establishing standards for a global crypto regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The FSB&rsquo;s document consists of two sets of recommendations: high-level recommendations for crypto regulation in general and &ldquo;revised high-level recommendations&rdquo; for a &ldquo;global stablecoin.&rdquo;</p>
FSB Maintains Respect for Privacy
<p>According to the FSB&rsquo;s recommendations, crypto platforms must segregate clients&rsquo; digital assets from their own funds and must clearly separate their functions to avoid conflicts of interest. Regulators are responsible for ensuring tight cross-border cooperation and oversight.</p>
<p>Despite stricter oversight measures, the FSB respects the principle of privacy. The international organization demands local regulators to ensure that there is no activity that &ldquo;may frustrate the identification of the responsible entity or affiliated entities.&rdquo; the regulator points to DeFi protocols in its recommendation of privacy and states:</p>

<p>Authorities should have access to the data as necessary and appropriate to fulfil their regulatory, supervisory and oversight mandates.</p>

FSB Requires Stablecoin Issuers to Have At least One &ldquo;Governance Body&rdquo;
<p>In its guidelines, the FSB addressed global stablecoin arrangements (GSCs) across jurisdictions to address their potential risks at a domestic and international level while supporting responsible innovation and providing adequate flexibility for jurisdictions to implement domestic approaches.</p>
<p>The board mandates any stablecoin issuer to have one or more identifiable and responsible individuals or legal entities it calls a &ldquo;governance body.&rdquo; It further requires issuers to maintain minimum reserve assets at a 1:1 ratio unless the issuer &ldquo;is subject to adequate prudential requirements&rdquo; equivalent to commercial bank standards.</p>
<p>The FSB also introduced a potential obligation for &ldquo;global stablecoin&rdquo; issuers to obtain a permit to operate in each jurisdiction. Guidelines state:</p>

<p>Authorities should not permit the operation of a GSC arrangement in their jurisdiction unless the GSC arrangement meets all of their jurisdiction&rsquo;s regulatory, supervisory, and oversight requirements, including affirmative approval.</p>

Implementation of Recommendations To Be Reviewed by End 2025
<p>The guidelines published by the FSB make up the first part of a global crypto framework, with further guidance from the IMF and BIS to come.</p>
<p>The FSB and the IMF will jointly submit &ldquo;a synthesis paper integrating the macroeconomic and regulatory perspectives of crypto assets&rdquo; in September 2023.</p>
<p>The IMF will also independently report on the &ldquo;potential macro-financial implications of the widespread adoption&rdquo; of CBDCs. At the same time, the BIS will provide a report on analytical and conceptual issues and possible risk mitigation strategies related to crypto assets.</p>
<p>The FSB said it will review the state of implementing its recommendations worldwide by the end of 2025.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance has successfully integrated Bitcoin Lightning Network on its platform for faster BTC withdrawals and deposits.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Integrates Bitcoin Lightning Network
<p>Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has achieved a significant milestone by successfully integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network on its platform. Around the end of June, the company had announced its decision to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network to scale up its BTC transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Binance team put out a statement on its website, announcing the successful integration and providing all the details users would need to access these transactions. Binance users will now be able to now conduct BTC deposits and withdrawals on the Lightning Network, opening up new possibilities for faster and more cost-effective transactions.</p>
How Does Lightning Network Work?
<p>The Bitcoin Lightning Network serves as a layer-two scaling solution that operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Its primary objective is to enhance transaction speed, reduce fees, and address scalability concerns. By creating off-chain transaction channels, the Lightning Network facilitates near-instantaneous and economically viable transactions for users.</p>
<p>With the completion of the integration, Binance users can locate their designated Bitcoin deposit addresses specifically tailored for the Lightning Network. These unique deposit addresses can be found on the platform's Deposit Crypto page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Lightning Network Advantages
<p>The Bitcoin Lightning Network offers several advantages over traditional on-chain transactions, primarily by alleviating congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain and enabling a higher number of transactions per second. By moving most transactions off-chain, the Lightning Network significantly enhances the scalability of the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Because Lightning Network transactions do not require confirmation by miners, it is conducive to near-instantaneous payment settlements. Users can enjoy the convenience of transactions being processed within seconds or even milliseconds, further enhancing the user experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, transactions on the Bitcoin Lightning Network typically incur lower fees than those executed directly on the Bitcoin network. This cost reduction makes microtransactions economically viable and encourages broader adoption across various use cases.</p>
<p>In addition to its speed and cost advantages, the Lightning Network provides enhanced privacy protection. By not revealing individual transaction details on the blockchain, the Lightning Network safeguards users' privacy, ensuring a secure and confidential transaction environment.</p>
<p>This move from Binance underscores its commitment to embracing innovative solutions that enhance cryptocurrency functionality and usability. By leveraging the Lightning Network's advantages, Binance aims to improve the efficiency and speed of Bitcoin transactions, thereby offering users a more streamlined trading experience.</p>
