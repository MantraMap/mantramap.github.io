<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Germany’s top watchdog BaFin turned down an application for a custody license from Binance, FinanceFWD reported.</li><li>Paysafe also announced its decision to end support for Euro transactions by September this year.</li><li>This comes as the exchange suffers blow after blow in European markets including being de-banked in Australia and pulling its registration application in the UK. </li><li>The company is also facing stiff regulatory action in the U.S. following lawsuits from the SEC alleging securities violations. </li></ul>



<p>Binance continues to face hurdles in European markets following a decision from its banking partner to end support for Euro transactions and BaFin&#8217;s rejection of the company&#8217;s custody license. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/binance-says-paysafe-to-cease-being-its-euro-payments-provider?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/binance-says-paysafe-to-cease-being-its-euro-payments-provider?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, banking partner Paysafe will no longer facilitate Euro deposits and withdrawals to and from the crypto exchange from September 2023. The decision will take effect from September 25 and will see Binance cut off from Paysafe&#8217;s Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) network, a spokesperson for the trading venue said. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the meantime, all methods of depositing and withdrawing other fiat currencies as well as buying and selling crypto on Binance.com remain unaffected, including bank transfer using one of the other fiat currencies supported by Binance, and buying and selling crypto directly via credit or debit card</p></blockquote>



<p>Binance&#8217;s license to offer custody services in Germany was rejected by the country&#8217;s top financial regulator BaFin, FinanceFWD <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>. The report cited people familiar with the saying, saying that it&#8217;s yet unclear if BaFin&#8217;s move constitutes an official decision or an intention to turn down the application for a custody license.</p>



<h2>Binance In The Midst Of European Hurricane</h2>



<p>The two latest setbacks for Binance come amid a string of blows for the world&#8217;s largest centralized crypto exchange across European jurisdictions and trouble in the U.S. </p>



<p>Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s company withdrew its license applications in Cyprus and the UK ahead of MiCA&#8217;s implementation by 2024. The company also requested to terminate its derivatives license in Australia amid a de-banking crisis with local banking partners. </p>



<p>Belgium&#8217;s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA)<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/belgium-binance-cease-all-crypto-services/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/belgium-binance-cease-all-crypto-services/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> issued a cease and desist orde</a>r for all crypto services offered to Belgian clients. </p>



<p>In the U.S. the company is accused of violating securities laws alongside exchange rival Coinbase. However, both entities have denied the allegations and attempted to throw out their respective lawsuits. </p>

<h2>MicroStrategy Ups Bitcoin Holds As Spot ETF Applications Surge </h2>

<p>Indeed, wall street titans like BlackRock have filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other players like WisdomTree and Invesco followed suit with respective applications.

<h2>Bitcoin Spot ETF Race Heats Up</h2>



<p>Fidelity enters a pool of institutions and companies in the open race to offer America&#8217;s first Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, a product that the SEC and Chair Gary Gensler have notoriously rejected on several occasions. </p>



<p>BlackRock <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-banks-bitcoins-largest-holder-mstr/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-banks-bitcoins-largest-holder-mstr/" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> its filing for a Bitcoin Spot ETF on June 15, ushering a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-rallies-29000-blackrock-etf-plays/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-rallies-29000-blackrock-etf-plays/" rel="noreferrer noopener">wave of applications</a> from other institutions like WisdomTree, Invesco, and now Fidelity. Crypto proponents speculate that the trillion-dollar asset manager stands a chance at success after successfully filing over 500 applications with the SEC.</p>



<p>Grayscale, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, has filed a number of unsuccessful applications with the securities watchdog. The company has repeatedly tried to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product to a Bitcoin Spot ETF with no luck. Grayscale is currently locked in a legal tussle with the SEC over the regulator&#8217;s decision to deny its application despite approving Bitcoin Futures ETFs. </p>



<p>Bloomberg analysts believe that Grayscale has a <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1673685658538323968?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1673685658538323968?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">70% chance</a> of winning in court after three judges heard arguments from both sides. This has also seemingly upped the chances of BlackRock&#8217;s application going through as the SEC could look to soften the impact of coming up short in court, per comments from Bloomberg&#8217;s Eric Balchunas and Elliott Z. Stein.</p>

<p>Crypto project Chibi Finance which runs atop the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling protocol Arbitrum allegedly rugged its users and disappeared with around $1 million in Ether (ETH).</p>



<p>The project styled itself as a yield-optimizing protocol that allowed users to automatically rack up rewards after depositing their crypto tokens on the platform. The platform&#8217;s native token CHIBI tanked 98% in value following the incident.</p>



<h2>Chibi Finance Team Goes AWOL</h2>



<p>On-chain security firm PeckShield reported that the Chibi Finance team drained 555 ETH worth $1 million from the project&#8217;s liquidity pools. </p>

<p>According to another security startup <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1673639936631734272?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1673639936631734272?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CertiK</a>, the developers were able to do this as they added malicious code in Chibi&#8217;s smart contract. This allowed the team to steal user funds after the contract was deployed and crypto investment poured in. The CertiK team noted that this is the 12th exit scam tracked so far in 2023.</p>



<p>After stealing the assets, the team moved funds from Arbitrum to Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem. PeckShield said the 555 ETH was then deposited in the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based platform used to obscure transactions. </p>



<p>The protocol is often used by crypto criminals to launder stolen wealth and was sanctioned by U.S. authorities last year due to suspicions that the North Korean hacker group Lazarus uses the service.</p>



<p>Community concerns over a rug pull increased after the Chibi Finance team scrubbed its digital presence following the asset drain. The project&#8217;s Twitter profile was deactivated and its website is unavailable. Crypto influencers like <a href="https://twitter.com/defi_mochi/status/1671159738233651200?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/defi_mochi/status/1671159738233651200?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@defi_mochi</a> also deleted their posts on the project. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Bybit will offer crypto exchange and digital asset custody services to users in Cyprus after bagging a license in the country.</li><li>The trading venue sets up shop in Cyprus ahead of the implementation of MiCA, the first crypto regulatory regime in a major jurisdiction.</li><li>Bybit enters Cyprus as Binance exits the country amid global regulatory woes and uncertainty in the U.S. following successive crackdowns by the SEC.</li></ul>



<p>Bybit, one of the world&#8217;s largest centralized exchanges, has obtained a crypto license to offer its services in Cyprus. The move comes ahead of the EU&#8217;s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) which comes into effect by mid-2024. </p>



<p>Regulators in the country have approved Bybit to “offer a full suite of services&#8221;, per a statement from the trading venue. Bybit CEO and co-founder Ben Zhou remarked that the license signals a mix of global expansion and compliance with &#8220;robust regulatory frameworks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We wholeheartedly support the regulatory objective of building a cryptocurrency industry that is both compliant, secure, and transparent, ultimately benefiting all those seeking financial freedom,”</p></blockquote>



<p>Bybit exited the Canadian market in May due to a regulatory shift in the country. Canadian users will lose access to Bybit&#8217;s trading platform by July/August this year.</p>



<h2>Binane Bows Out Of Cyprus, Bybit Rolls In</h2>



<p>Bybit&#8217;s entrance into the country follows the exit of crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchange &#8211; Binance. Binance <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-under-investigation-in-france/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-under-investigation-in-france/" rel="noreferrer noopener">deregistered</a> its local arm ahead of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">MiCA&#8217;s implementation</a> expected next year. The leading crypto exchange also withdrew its crypto license application in Austria per <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-oesterreich/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-oesterreich/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> today. </p>



<p>The island nation, like a handful of jurisdictions around the world, has noted plans to develop its local crypto industry into a global hub for digital asset innovation. In June 2022, the policymakers in the country tried to pass a bill on digital assets meant to clarify standards for the industry. Ultimately, the bill lost steam and was binned in 2023.</p>

<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s largest bank HSBC officially enabled the trading of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are listed on the region&#8217;s local stock exchange.

<p>HSBC became the first bank in the special administrative region in China to allow easy access to Bitcoin and Ether ETF trading. According to Wu, users will be able to trade three ETFs currently listed including CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF.</p>



<p>The giant bank also launched a Virtual Asset Investor Education Centre to sensitize investors on risk and disclosure related to crypto asset investment. </p>

<ul><li>FTX has sued K5 Global to recover the $700 million invested in it by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</li><li>Bankman-Fried transferred vast sums of money from his trading firm to K5 and other related ventures in 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>The investment reportedly allowed the disgraced FTX founder to gain access to politicians and celebrities in the United States.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt crypto exchange has accused Bankman-Fried of investing billions without proper due diligence.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-judge-says-hide-customers-identities/">FTX</a> has sued California-based investment firm K5 Global, founded by a former advisor to top U.S. politician Hillary Clinton. The crypto exchange is looking to claw back a whopping $700 million from K5. The amount was transferred to the investment firm by the crypto exchange’s disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried last year. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX’s Bankman-Fried Invested In K5 To Gain Access To Politicians and Celebrities</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-ex-clinton-aides-investment-firm-700-million-2023-06-22/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, FTX sued K5 Global and its co-founder Michael Kives who previously worked for former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The bankrupt crypto exchange’s latest move was part of an effort to recover the $700 million that was transferred by Bankman-Fried to K5 Global and its associates in 2022 as part of an investment. The funds for this investment were reportedly misappropriated from the crypto exchange. </p>



<p>As per the lawsuit filed in Delaware Bankruptcy Court, internal notes from Bankman-Fried revealed that he was captivated by what Kives and his investment firm had to offer. The disgraced founder described it as “something of a one-stop shop for relationships” that he felt should be utilized by his crypto firm. The weeks following these internal notes reportedly saw the former crypto billionaire sign a term to invest billions of dollars in K5.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>K5 was under the impression – like many others – that SBF was completely legitimate and they were entering into a fair, long-term, and mutually beneficial business relationship. Our belief is that the lawsuit is without merit.” </p><cite>K5 Global spokeswoman </cite></blockquote>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s term sheet also included a $125 million payment for Michael Kives and K5 co-founder Bryan Baum. The latest lawsuit also accused Bankman-Fried of failing to conduct sufficient due diligence before extending vast sums of money to K5 and associated ventures. He reportedly made the investments in order to secure access to high profile personalities, including politicians and celebrities. </p>

<ul><li>A class action lawsuit filed by Celsius investors has been amended to include crypto market maker Wintermute Trading.&nbsp;</li><li>The lawsuit accused Wintermute of aiding CEO Alex Mashinsky in duping Celsius investors.&nbsp;</li><li>The defunct crypto lender’s investors have claimed that the market maker engaged in wash trading to inflate CEL’s value.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A class action lawsuit filed by investors of the Celsius Network has named crypto market maker Wintermute Trading. Wintermute, one of the biggest liquidity providers in the crypto market, has been accused of helping <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arrington-coinbase-acquire-celsius-assets/">Celsius</a> founder and CEO Alex Mashinsky of duping the defunct crypto lender’s investors. </p>



<h2><strong>Celsius Investors: Wintermute Engaged In Wash Trading To Pump CEL</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-23/celsius-investors-claim-crypto-market-maker-wintermute-aided-wash-trading" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, plaintiffs who filed a class action lawsuit against Alex Mashinsky and other Celsius executives amended their complaint to include Wintermute Trading Ltd. The investors have accused the London-based crypto market maker of engaging in wash trading and other malpractices since as early as March 2021. As per the amended complaint, improper activities were adopted to inflate the value of the crypto lender’s native CEL token as well as other loan products. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When deciding whether to trade in CEL Tokens, a reasonable investor would consider it important to know that the Executive Defendants and Wintermute were engaging in manipulative trading with respect to the CEL tokens, and ensuring that the reported trading volumes reflected real market demand.” </p><cite>Amended complaint by Celsius investors</cite></blockquote>



<p>Lawyers representing the disgruntled investors claimed that Wintermute&#8217;s trading activities corrupted the price of the CEL token as well as the trading volume reported by the crypto lending platform. They further accused the market maker of colluding with the lender to engage in a strategic pattern to deceive the latter’s investors. The amended complaint also accused Wintermute of playing a key role in the failed attempt by Mashinsky to prop up the CEL token in May 2022 following the collapse of Terra. Wintermute didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment by Bloomberg. Attorneys representing Alex Mashinsky declined to comment. </p>

<ul><li>Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority has ordered Binance to cease its operations in the country.&nbsp;</li><li>The regulator has taken issue with the exchange offering crypto services from non-EEA countries.&nbsp;</li><li>The FSMA has indicated that the crypto exchange may have to face criminal charges for its actions.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange has been asked to return all crypto assets belonging to Belgian customers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Financial Services and Markets Authority of Belgium has ordered Binance to immediately cease its operations in the country and stop offering crypto and custody services to Belgian customers. The order comes amid mounting legal troubles for the crypto exchange, which was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month for illegally operating a securities exchange in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance May Be Liable For Criminal Charges In Belgium</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.fsma.be/en/news/fsma-orders-binance-cease-immediately-all-offers-virtual-currency-services-belgium" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA), <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-under-investigation-in-france/">Binance</a> has been ordered to take immediate measures to return crypto assets belonging to Belgian clients. The regulator directed the crypto exchange to contact their clients and entertain any instructions related to the return of their assets. The FSMA accused Binance of violating a law that prevents firms from non-European Economic Area countries from offering services in Belgium. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Persons or firms governed by the law of a country that is not a member of the European Economic Area are prohibited from offering or providing, within Belgium, by way of a professional activity – even if supplementary or ancillary – exchange services between virtual currencies and legal currencies or custody wallet services.</p></blockquote>



<p>As per the FSMA, several requests were made to Binance for information related to its operations from an EEA member country. The exchange reportedly failed to demonstrate that the crypto services being provided in Belgium were carried out from a legal entity governed by an EEA country. The regulator further stated that the Crown Prosecutor of Brussels had been informed of Binance’s acts which are liable to constitute a criminal offense.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>There was no official response from Binance at the time of writing. However, CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to share his famous “4” tweet, which he uses to convey to his followers any ongoing FUD against his crypto firm. “1, 2, 3…..” Zhao tweeted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have revealed the identities of the top depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, the ill-fated crypto-friendly bank that was shut down by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) in March this year following liquidity and solvency concerns.</p>



<h2><strong>FDIC Provided $1 Billion Backstop To Sequoia Capital</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-23/fdic-insured-billions-in-deposits-for-sequoia-other-top-svb-customers" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that venture capital giant Sequoia Capital and stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial were among the top depositors at Silicon Valley Bank. Other high-profile clients in the failed bank’s top 10 list included Chinese tech firm Kanzhun, Altos Labs, Marqueta Inc, and Roku Inc. USDC issuer <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-taps-former-cftc-chair-legal-chief/">Circle</a> was the largest depositor, with an exposure of over $3.3 billion. Sequoia held over $1 billion with the failed lender. </p>



<p>The FDIC, which only insures deposits up to $250,000, decided to guarantee accounts over $250,000 when SVB was shut down by regulators. Interestingly, the regulator covered Sequoia’s $1 billion deposit with the failed bank. Kanzhun Ltd, which had a deposit of $902 million, also got a backstop for more than $900 million from the banking regulator. According to Bloomberg, the insurance to the deposits of high-profile SVB clients prevented a “catastrophic blow” to the tech and crypto sectors. However, the FDIC provided excessive insurance to high-profile clients that were “in no real danger”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The identities of Silicon Valley Bank’s top depositors were revealed after the FDIC accidentally released an unredacted document related to the bank’s collapse. The document was released in response to a Bloomberg News Freedom of Information Act request by the media house.</p>
