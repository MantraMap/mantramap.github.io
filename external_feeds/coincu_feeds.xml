<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Saga smartphone by Solana Mobile indeed aims to provide users with a comprehensive solution for engaging in various activities related to cryptocurrency and the decentralized web. With its focus on minting NFTs, trading crypto, and navigating web3, the Saga phone seeks to empower individuals to participate actively in the digital economy.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-1024x768.png" alt="Solana Saga Review: The First Crypto Phone To Explore The Web3" class="wp-image-199455" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-38.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Solana Saga Review: The First Crypto Phone To Explore The Web3 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>In an era where concerns about privacy and control over personal data have become significant, the Saga phone&#8217;s success will largely depend on how it addresses these issues. As you mentioned earlier, smartphones have increasingly become surveillance devices that track and monitor our activities. If the Saga phone can offer robust security measures, enhanced user privacy, and greater control over personal data, it may resonate with individuals who prioritize these values.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Saga phone&#8217;s seamless integration of blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps) could potentially offer a user-friendly experience for individuals interested in exploring the world of cryptocurrency and web3. By providing a convenient platform for minting NFTs and trading crypto, the Saga phone might contribute to the wider adoption of these technologies.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that the success of the Saga phone will depend not only on its technological capabilities but also on factors such as market demand, competition, and user satisfaction. As the crypto and blockchain space continues to evolve rapidly, it will be intriguing to see how devices like the Saga phone shape the narrative of this ongoing saga themselves. Let&#8217;s find out more about this phone with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is the Saga Phone?</h2>



<p>The Solana Saga is a new Solana and OSOM solution that combines a flagship phone with an innovative method to handle built-in wallet security for popular Solana wallets like as Solflare and Phantom. Therefore, in a nutshell, it&#8217;s a crypto phone with outstanding specifications and consistent day-to-day performance.</p>



<p>The Solana phone costs $1,000 and is now available. The official release date for the Solana Saga phone is May 8th, 2023. You may now receive one if you pre-ordered. If you haven&#8217;t already purchased the Saga, you may sign up on Solana Mobile to be alerted when the phones are ready to ship.</p>



<p>The team believes that even in the worst-case scenario, customers will wind up purchasing a really wonderful Android gadget. The phone will also have privacy measures that allow users to disable Google and other services to which they do not want access.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seed Vault</strong></h3>



<p>Phantom and Solfare Solana wallets employ a 12-word seed phrase to generate or restore a wallet&#8217;s private keys (the keys that let you spend crypto). Solana&#8217;s seed vault ups the ante by producing a secure key with a 24-word seed phrase in encrypted storage and then granting access to the seed vault to certain applications — the aforementioned Phantom and Solflare wallets — for safe transactions.</p>



<p>These applications are installed via Solana&#8217;s own dApp Store rather than Google Play, with the following advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Secure seed vault (knows your seed phrase)</li>



<li>Solana dApp wallets (unknown seed phrase)</li>



<li>Solana mobile applications (just talk to the wallet)</li>



<li>More applications for Android 13 OS</li>
</ul>



<p>This configuration keeps your seed phrase distinct from the operating system and other software. It should be noted that the seed vault only works with Solana and the two wallets stated above. If you need to utilize another blockchain, the process is the same as it is on any other Android phone; you set up or restore the seed phrase from inside the app. The seed vault&#8217;s 24-word seed phrase is also compatible with other Solana wallets.</p>



<p>For the sake of science, I successfully imported the wallet into the Phantom Wallet Chrome plugin. I was able to execute the same thing on another Android phone after a few attempts, although the difficulties might have been due to a hardware problem. In what we&#8217;ll term &#8220;The Klondike Derby sled incident,&#8221; the phone in issue was once retrieved from an ice-encrusted snowbank.</p>



<p>In summary, even if you drive over your sparkling Saga with a hefty, hand-crafted sled, you can still retrieve your crypto wallet, although in a less secure manner than utilizing Saga&#8217;s seed vault.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DApp Store</strong></h3>



<p>The Solana Saga phone comes with 18 dApps that can be downloaded. During seed setup, you may have one or both wallets downloaded automatically. Additional dApps, such as Marinade (liquid Solana staking, anyone?) and Jupiter (swaps aplenty), may be downloaded from a special dApp store.</p>



<p>These Solana dApps&#8217; updates and permissions are likewise distinct from the Play Store.</p>



<p>Although the dApp selection is still limited, some of the major brands are already there, and the list is expected to increase over time. The dApp store is based on the Solana Mobile Stack (SMS), an open-source toolkit that allows developers to create mobile applications.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wallets</strong></h3>



<p>Phantom and Solflare are two possibilities to examine.</p>



<p>Each wallet supports both the seed vault and biometric authentication. At the touch of a finger, you may approve transactions. They both include connections to certain more dApps inside their wallet applications. Phantom, for example, has Solend (a crypto lending software), and Solfare includes a built-in browser, allowing you to go into the DeFi weeds if you so choose.</p>



<p>You may also access DeFi applications with Chrome or another browser. I used Chrome to connect to Solend and Marinade, selecting &#8220;Mobile Wallet Adapter&#8221; from the connect option. This summons your seed vault wallet of choice, in my instance Phantom.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Minty Fresh</strong></h3>



<p>Minty Fresh is one of 18 applications available in the dApp marketplace, and it&#8217;s really simple to use. Minty Fresh NFTs are created from your own graphics or photographs. If you&#8217;ve always wanted an NFT of your big toe or your dog that barks like a maniac during Zoom calls, now&#8217;s your chance.</p>



<p>Separately, the Saga comes with a free Genesis NFT — as well as a little dollars to get you started on your Solana voyage. That&#8217;s a nice touch.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jupiter And Marinade</strong></h3>



<p>Jupiter Finance dApp is a DeFi virtual currency asset developed on Solana.</p>



<p>Marinade Finance is a Solana-based non-custodial liquid staking mechanism. Marinade delivers a frictionless experience via automated staking techniques, with no lockup periods and fast access to staking rewards, for users who wish to stake their SOL tokens and participate in DeFi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Solana Mobile Stack</h2>



<p>The Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) is a free and open-source developer tool for building mobile-first cryptocurrency apps on the Solana blockchain.</p>



<p>Other blockchain applications may also contribute their code to Solana Labs to be audited and integrated. The objective for the future is to outsource the audit and integration to other teams.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-41.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-41.png" alt="Solana Saga Review: The First Crypto Phone To Explore The Web3" class="wp-image-199458" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-41.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-41-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-41-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-41-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Solana Saga Review: The First Crypto Phone To Explore The Web3 6"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Fees</h2>



<p>Apart from network costs for transactions, exchange fees, and staking fees (all of which are standard), users should not incur any additional expenses. Thus far, the Solana dApp store is completely free to use, with no hidden fees. This is subject to change in the future. With crypto, there are no assurances.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Security</h2>



<p>Two-thirds of the way up the rear of the Saga is a round, recessed fingerprint sensor. Learn how to use that part of the phone since you&#8217;ll use it a lot.</p>



<p>Saga takes security carefully since it syncs to user wallets and seed storage. Most Saga users are unlikely to be able to tell where Saga UX and security finish and an individual app&#8217;s security starts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Customer Support</h2>



<p>OSOM, a privacy-focused startup, created the Saga (like the seed vault). Nevertheless, support is only available via Solana Mobile. The website has a ticket system, a chat, and various FAQ-style support pages. The Saga is covered by a one-year limited guarantee against faults for the original owner alone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why Saga has good support for crypto users?</h2>



<p>Nowadays, cryptocurrency is mostly utilized on desktop browsers and is not optimized for mobile. The cooperation between OSOM and Solana Labs, hopefully, will alter that by allowing mobile-first web 3 solutions.</p>



<p>Crypto-specific hardware enables developers to construct previously unimaginable products. This incredible experience requires the following components:</p>



<ul>
<li>Secure Elements that allow you to access your keys safely while the wallet never sees your seed phrase</li>



<li>Trust Zone that prevents your wallet from lying about what you are signing APIs that allow you to do Bip 39 Key Recovery</li>



<li>Decentralized Dapp Marketplace with no fees at first (0.2% transaction fees in the future)</li>
</ul>



<p>If the Saga and the Solana network as a whole want to enroll a billion people, the seed vault is a step in the right way — but it&#8217;s just the first of many.</p>



<p>Most individuals will not bother with a 24-word recovery phrase that they must keep secret. To achieve Solana&#8217;s aim, a new strategy may be required at some time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The Solana Saga accomplishes its goal: it&#8217;s a phone that has a Solana hardware wallet and showcases the best of what web3 has to offer. The issue is that what web3 has to offer is still limited to NFTs and trading.</p>



<p>Android used to be the Linux to iOS&#8217;s macOS: a far more open experience with rough edges that might rend your shirt. It&#8217;s now just as wonderful as iOS, but less limited and complicated.</p>



<p>The Saga is a usable blockchain phone with built-in security that many cryptocurrency consumers will look for.</p>



<p>The phone symbolizes a stride forward for the network after numerous steps back: it slipped out of the top ten in terms of market capitalization, gained unwelcome publicity for network disruptions, and saw the arrest of its most vocal advocate, Sam Bankman-Fried. This phone provides developers with a strong foundation for re-establishing the network&#8217;s dominance.</p>

<p>While Ethereum continues to dominate most key metrics, Solana has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing Ethereum&#8217;s NFT trading volume. Ethereum has long been regarded as the leading platform for NFTs, but Solana has emerged as a formidable contender among the Ethereum Killers. The platform NFT trading volume reached an impressive $25.5 million within a 24-hour period, eclipsing Ethereum&#8217;s $24.5 million.</p>



<p>This marks a significant breakthrough for this platform, as it is the first time the platform has outperformed Ethereum in terms of total NFT trading volume. While Ethereum boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $26.7 billion, SOL&#8217;s TVL currently stands at $265.57 million.</p>



<p>Despite the gap in TVL and market capitalization between Ethereum ($231.17 billion) and SOL ($7.38 billion), <a href="https://coincu.com/199109-solana-makes-final-breakthrough/">Solana</a>&#8216;s recent surge in NFT trading volume highlights its growing prominence and potential as a thriving blockchain ecosystem.</p>

<p>As Solana continues to gain traction and demonstrate its potential, the platform&#8217;s achievements in the NFT market are enhancing its reputation and drawing the attention of investors as well as fans. Solana is establishing itself as a formidable competitor in the blockchain business, as seen by its rapid expansion and its capacity to hold its own against more well-established companies.</p>



<p>While Ethereum remains the dominant force, the recent achievement in NFT trading volume demonstrates its ability to carve out a niche and establish itself as a viable alternative. As the competition among blockchain platforms intensifies, the platform upward trajectory showcases its determination to challenge the status quo and redefine the future of decentralized applications and digital assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BiSwap LP migration pool attack causes $710,000 in losses due to vulnerabilities in the migration contract, allowing asset manipulation and deception of users.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform swiftly resolves the Migrator contract vulnerability, ensuring the safety of user funds and emphasizing the importance of robust security measures in the DeFi space.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent incident, BiSwap, a popular decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, fell victim to a migration pool attack, resulting in significant losses of approximately $710,000.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The attack exposed vulnerabilities in the <a href="https://coincu.com/174208-biswap-review/">BiSwap</a> migration contract, allowing the attacker to manipulate assets and deceive users. However, BiSwap swiftly responded to the incident and resolved the Migrator contract vulnerability, ensuring the safety of user funds.</p>



<p>Security company Fairyproof conducted a brief analysis of the attack, revealing that the BiSwap migration contract lacked essential verifications. Firstly, the unverified migration allowed anyone to replace legitimate migration transactions. Secondly, the unverified parameters of the tokens and pairs enabled the attacker to forge token0, token1, and Pair, facilitating the attack.</p>



<p>The attacker employed a two-step process to carry out the exploit. Initially, they used real pairs and fake tokens to initiate the migration function, leaving users&#8217; LP assets burned within the contract. By adding only two fake tokens, the attacker formed their LP pool, while the user&#8217;s assets remained trapped.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-hack-1024x539.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-hack-1024x539.jpeg" alt="BiSwap LP Migration Pool Attack Results In $710,000 Losses" class="wp-image-199439" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-hack-1024x539.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-hack-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-hack-768x404.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-hack-750x395.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-hack.jpeg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BiSwap LP Migration Pool Attack Results In $710,000 Losses 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the subsequent step, the attacker exploited the migration function again, this time using the real token0, token1, and the previously generated fake LP. They added the assets left within the contract during the first step as their LP. As a result, the user&#8217;s assets were replaced with fake LP assets, redirecting them to the attacker&#8217;s LP.</p>



<p>Fairyproof estimated that the attack inflicted approximately $710,251 in damages. However, BiSwap took immediate action upon discovering the vulnerability. The platform promptly detected and resolved the Migrator contract vulnerability, ensuring the safety of user funds.</p>



<p>BiSwap, in response to the incident, issued a statement urging users to refrain from accessing the contract. They assured users that their funds remained secure after the vulnerability had been addressed. By swiftly addressing the issue, BiSwap demonstrated its commitment to safeguarding user assets and maintaining the trust of its community.</p>



<p>The BiSwap LP migration pool attack highlights the importance of robust security measures within the DeFi space. While the incident resulted in significant losses, BiSwap&#8217;s quick response in resolving the vulnerability and protecting user funds is commendable. Moving forward, it is crucial for decentralized platforms to implement thorough security audits and verifications to prevent such attacks and maintain the integrity of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Themis Protocol is the first protocol to introduce DeFi to the thriving Metaverse and GameFi economies. Leverage your NFT and GameFi liquidity by using it as collateral for loans.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-36.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-36.png" alt="Themis Protocol Review: Lending Platform Helps Metaverse Explode" class="wp-image-199429" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-36.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-36-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-36-768x404.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-36-750x395.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Themis Protocol Review: Lending Platform Helps Metaverse Explode 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>So what is Themis Protocol? Let&#8217;s find out details about this project with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Themis Protocol?</h2>



<p>Themis Protocol is a layer-2 crypto trading platform that offers NFT mortgage loans based on past NFT transaction data.</p>



<p>The protocol is a set of DeFi protocols built using smart contracts. It enables users to take on various roles in the governance chain based on their degree of risk and receive corresponding rewards. Participants have the ability to lend, borrow, stack yield, auction, and leverage UNI-V3. This is something unique that past efforts have not been able to do.</p>



<p>Themis also provides liquidity providers with leverage: NFTs may be used to borrow stablecoins. Market makers, launchpads, and long-term holders benefit from the scaling protocol&#8217;s liquidity. Themis adds liquidity to a previously illiquid metaverse.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>Themis Protocol is an Ethereum-based decentralized peer-to-peer lending mechanism. It is ERC-721/ERC-1155-compliant and enables users to make anonymous loans between fund pools and NFT mortgagors. Contains Uniswap-V3 LP locations.</p>



<p>Market Makers &#8211; Market Makers may also profit from market creation by establishing loan payment arrangements with a pool of money in order to borrow crypto assets for other uses.</p>



<p>Themis user object:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lender: Deposit assets into the platform. Themis will then create 1 quantity of tToken tokens in a 1:1 ratio to match the number of user assets. The value of this tToken will progressively rise over time, and the user may return the full tToken to the original asset at any moment. The remaining tTokens will thereafter be incinerated from the system.</li>



<li>Borrower: Give collateral (token or LP token) in order to borrow an equivalent amount of money. Moreover, Themis mints 1 number of sToken or vToken tokens at a 1:1 ratio to symbolize the user&#8217;s obligation. The quantity of these s/vTokens grows over time, and when the loan + interest is paid off, the borrower receives the collateral back. The remaining s/vTokens are then burnt from the system.</li>
</ul>



<p>Accepting various sorts of collateral. Themis&#8217; assets are separated into two categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>M0: A large quantity of liquid collateral is represented by M0.</li>



<li>M1: LP tokens serve as collateral.</li>
</ul>



<p>Lenders may provide assets to one of the two groups. They gain a greater APY margin when they provide liquidity into M1.</p>



<p>When a borrower&#8217;s debt surpasses 80% of the collateral&#8217;s value, their property is liquidated. Themis is separated into two categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>For assets in group M0, the liquidator returns a portion or the whole amount owing and earns a liquidation incentive. The liquidator has the option of receiving the necessary amount of tToken rather than the underlying asset.</li>



<li>There is no Liquidation Bonus in M1, thus, the liquidator repays the total amount owing for collateral at a reduced price.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights of Themis Protocol</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collateral UNI-V3 NFT</strong></h3>



<p>When a user defaults, Themis Protocol readily accesses asset values in UNI-V3, utilizing that data as the foundation for offering mortgages of equivalent value. NFT is employed for withdrawals, which helps to secure the primary lender&#8217;s security. It is also the system that allows UNI-V3 market makers to use the Vault pool and leveraged instruments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Risk management</strong></h3>



<p>Themis Protocol employs a straightforward risk management strategy. To counteract systemic risk, risk will be allocated to all parts of governance by concentrating on three factors: asset liquidity, profit, and safety.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yielding Farming</strong></h3>



<p>Themis Protocol&#8217;s NFT Mortgage Plan now includes traditional mortgage lending in addition to inner ring collateral liquidity expectations and new output tokens. The return and risk of each post-mortgage phase are intended for risk diversification.</p>



<p>With several unique new incentives, such as token account cancellation and incentive rules, the price of assets for mortgage lending will be more stable on Themis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Products of Themis Protocol</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lending To The Metaverse</strong></h3>



<p>Themis Protocol is hosted on Ethereum and will enable additional parallel chains in the future. Themis also delivers business nodes at various locations based on the attributes of the property. As a result, Themis&#8217; basic structure is very significant. The ultimate objective of Themis Protocol is to become &#8220;Libra&#8221; in order to quantify the worth of native crypto assets.</p>



<p>Themis is built in accordance with the following principles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Compatible with all Ethereum assets: Ethereum was the first practical and extensively utilized smart contract platform. Each crypto community has its own mature native assets deployed on Ethereum, allowing other communities to access a decent environment.<br>Simultaneously, Ethereum compatibility implies that code may be cycled on the same sort of public chain as BSC, or in parallel across many public chains using cross-chain bridges, enabling numerous users to utilize the product.</li>



<li>Simple Risk Management Model: Themis&#8217; risk management logic is based on the three-way assessment concept, which assigns risk to the asset&#8217;s safety, profitability, and liquidity attributes. Combats systemic risk by allocating various risks and reverting to different linkages.</li>



<li>Market-Based Lending: The key to mortgage lending is to guarantee that the collateral is worth more than the loan money. As a result, borrowers must have unrestricted access to price and collateral via long-term decentralized agreements.</li>



<li>Scalability of the business: The basic framework includes mortgage lending, liquidation, asset auction, LP token mining pool, hedging pool, and quote collector, with future business expansion capabilities including full mortgage lending, NFT issuance, decentralized exchange, insurance, Oracle, and Vault.</li>



<li>Native Crypto Asset Management: To maintain corporate compliance, Themis Protocol exclusively offers services for native crypto assets. The freshly produced token is a utility token or crypto login that the admin session generates. These credentials may be valuable, but they do not guarantee security token attributes such as corporate income, equity, and so on.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lending Pool</strong></h3>



<p>Direct peer-to-peer agreements, which are unsecured between market participants, allow lending. When this format is used for NFT lending, there is no information equivalency between the borrower and the lender, resulting in considerable expenses for both sides. In decentralized networks, peer-to-peer lending proved unsuccessful.</p>



<p>Decentralized lending protocols like AAVE and Compound are now being utilized to establish funds with interest rates that are computed algorithmically based on changes in asset supply and demand. To earn or pay variable interest, asset borrowers and suppliers engage directly with the protocol, which becomes more efficient.</p>



<p>When it is decided that the user would be unable to repay the loan, a liquidation procedure will be carried out to reclaim the lender&#8217;s principle and interest by a rigorous payment to a third party.</p>



<p>When reading a user-authorized NFT, the Themis protocol will scan at least three blocks (to prevent a fast loan attack) to obtain the ApproveBind asset price in a third-party protocol platform, and if successful, TokenHub will tick the price relationship of that NFT to the tied asset in order to obtain the offer. The following loan procedure is completed based on this quotation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT Auction</strong></h3>



<p>Themis Protocol differs from other NFT auction systems in that its NFT is conducted in a Dutch auction manner. This was created with the goal of dealing with challenging assets in mind. It will subsequently be made available to all users that want to trade using NFT swiftly.</p>



<p>Each new bid causes the preceding bid to fail, and if no additional bids are received during the countdown, the NFT will be awarded to the highest bidder. If no offers are received, the price will be decreased by 5%.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Farming with LP tokens</strong></h3>



<p>Themis offers high-yielding agricultural services like sushi, pancakes, and many other DEXs, but for different reasons. Users could only farm using TMS pairs until the DEX became stable.</p>



<p>Themis&#8217; team investigated the logic and security of the NFT lending protocol. Themis protocol is built on the principle of governance by objective, differentiating responsibilities in the chain and dispersing risks, which primarily carry the following risks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lenders: are mostly exposed to interest rate risk.</li>



<li>Borrowers and lenders: Lenders face the majority of interest rate risk. Since Themis is a decentralized protocol and borrowers use excessive collateral, lenders may collect principle and interest by liquidating the borrower&#8217;s assets, although the interest is only slightly greater than that.</li>



<li>Suppliers of liquidity: Particularly vulnerable to security issues as a result of temporary losses. The gains from liquidity mining, on the other hand, might be quite substantial.</li>



<li>The liquidator is primarily responsible for profit risk.</li>



<li>Dividend holders: face mostly liquidity risk and may participate in all Themis Protocol utility allocations by pledging TMS; nevertheless, price swings in TMS may occur while trading.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT Avatar</strong></h3>



<p>The NFT Avatar symbolizes the user&#8217;s VIP status. User addresses with NFT signature limitations are permitted to borrow at higher mortgage interest rates. The contract validates the balance of the NFT included in the borrower&#8217;s address when the user uses this power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">TMS token</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aave community voting to freeze TUSD on Aave V2 reserve due to concerns.</em></li>



<li><em>Users are unable to deposit or borrow TUSD if the proposal passes.</em></li>



<li><em>TUSD&#8217;s value dropped, and regulatory issues with custodians caused confusion.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aave community is voting on a proposal to freeze the TUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum pool, as proposed in an AIP.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32-1024x573.png" alt="Aave V2 Is Considering Freeze TUSD Out Of Fear Of The Stablecoin Crisis" class="wp-image-199423" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32-1024x573.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32-300x168.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32-768x430.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32-1536x859.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32-750x419.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32-1140x638.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-32.png 1788w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave V2 Is Considering Freeze TUSD Out Of Fear Of The Stablecoin Crisis 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>After the recent TUSD asset incident, it is recommended to freeze the Aave V2 Ethereum pool&#8217;s TUSD reserve, preventing users from depositing or borrowing TUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum pool.</p>



<p>This has no effect on existing holdings, and users may continue to payback and withdraw TUSD from the Aave V2 Ethereum pool. This AIP intends to take a cautious approach to the TUSD problem. It will enable the community to evaluate the issue before making any further judgments.</p>



<p>There are still 14 hours till voting ends, but the current support rating is 83.76%.</p>

<p>The methods for minting and redeeming TUSD tokens have gotten confusing, with some users reporting difficulties on both fronts.</p>



<p>TrueUSD (TUSD) issuers previously stated that it had &#8220;no exposure&#8221; to the digital asset on- and off-ramp business Prime Trust, which was recently shut down by Nevada authorities. The team also boasts about its trading volume just after TUSD lost its peg to the dollar, escalating coin holders&#8217; concerns over the recent collapse of crucial TUSD custodian Prime Trust.</p>

<p>In the midst of TUSD&#8217;s volatility, there were actions that seemed to gamble against the coin. Kraken said in a post that consumers might obtain exposure to TUSD without holding it by moving any collateral currencies to a futures wallet on their platform.</p>



<p>TUSD <a href="https://coincu.com/198410-trueusd-depegs-at-90-cents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plummeted</a> to 80 cents to one USD on Binance.US on Wednesday before stabilizing at 90 cents to the dollar at the time of writing. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> statistics, its overall market value remained stable in the early hours before plummeting abruptly, losing close to $100 million along the way.</p>

<p>Litecoin made the following statement on Twitter on July 1 in honor of Canada Day:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The impending halving event, scheduled for August 2, 2023, adds to the good prognosis for Litecoin. This will be LTC&#8217;s third halving event, with the block reward dropping from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC. Although previous halving occurrences have often been connected with price hikes owing to increased scarcity, it remains to be seen how the market will react this time. In recent days, the price of LTC has risen dramatically against the background of an impending halving event.</p>

<p>Litecoin reached a big milestone as it surpassed the $100 barrier, reaching a 14-month high in price. The hash rate of LTC, which acts as a measure of the blockchain&#8217;s processing capacity, is a significant component fueling its increasing pace.</p>



<p>Additionally, Litecoin has lately avoided regulatory attention from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although the SEC has not categorized LTC explicitly, it has raised concerns about unregistered securities, especially those that use the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. But, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies like LTC are excluded from this group.</p>

<p>The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry and Technology has urged the government to develop a national blockchain policy that defines the country&#8217;s regulatory stance and shows support for the sector. The parliamentary committee also wants the Canadian government to create a unique regulatory system for stablecoins that separates them from other crypto assets, comparable to the European Union&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), which classifies stablecoins as a separate asset class.</p>

<p>So what is Certik? What makes this project stand out? Coincu will give extensive information on the CertiK project and its CTK token in the next article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is CertiK?</h2>



<p>CertiK is a platform for testing smart contracts without the need for human participation, with all operations carried out automatically. Decentralized and blockchain apps will utilize the ecosystem. CTK tokens are used for intra-project transactions. The project&#8217;s developer says that his solution may remove the possibility of faults and vulnerabilities in the programming. A novel mining system based on a proof-of-concept algorithm and an economic model based on the usage of CTK tokens as an incentive for ecosystem players.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">CertiK chain</h2>



<p>CertiK Chain is a consensus-based Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain that seeks to serve as a foundation for infrastructure blockchains and decentralized applications. This addresses the many steps of the application deployment process, such as smart contract compilation, generated bytecode verification versus source code, and on-node execution verification.</p>



<p>The implementation of DPoS with established security enables the project to adopt robust anti-attack measures against assaults such as forged cross-chain transactions or quantum computer hacking.</p>



<p>CertiK Chain&#8217;s architecture is made up of six distinct modules for each level. Each module is in charge of compiling and validating the source code, reviewing the compilation results, producing the signature from the source code, and assembling the blocks based on the signature. Communication modules are implemented in both Ethereum and IPFS through communication channels. CertiK Chain is compatible with several protocols, including ERC-20, ERC-223, and Nano. Its primary goal is to serve the complete spectrum of mainstream applications in order to assure market liquidity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The main components</h2>



<p>CertiK mainnet and many software solutions, such as the CertiKOS operating system, DeepSEA programming language, CertiK Security Oracle, and CertiK virtual machine, were introduced. The project&#8217;s remarkable characteristics include:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CertiK Security Oracle </strong></h3>



<p>In the blockchain, Oracle is used to transport off-chain data into and out of smart contracts. The CertiK Security Oracle&#8217;s aim is to obtain a set of security scores from a decentralized network of security operators who are in charge of assessing the trustworthiness of its source code. By executing real-time security checks enabled by a decentralized network of miners, on-chain transactions are protected from malicious assaults.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CertiKOS</strong></h3>



<p>CertiKOS is a smart contract-based operating system that focuses on security and resilience to hacker assaults.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skynet</strong></h3>



<p>Skynet is a unified security toolset that uses automated algorithms to evaluate deployed smart contracts against a diverse set of known vulnerabilities at scale. Skynet provides smart contracts with accurate security scores, indicating a possible vulnerability to attacks and code flaws.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CertiK Virtual Machine (CVM)</strong></h3>



<p>CVM is a virtual computer that provides configurable information regarding smart contract security.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeepSEA </strong></h3>



<p>DeepSEA is a functional programming language that allows developers to handle extremely complex codes during verification via the Coq proof assistant. DeepSEA is compatible with Microsoft&#8217;s CertiK Chain virtual machines, Ethereum WebAssembly, and Ant Financial&#8217;s AntChain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CertiKShield</strong></h3>



<p>CertiKShield is a fund established to restore funds stolen by attackers as a result of the project&#8217;s security flaws. This fund has collaborated with well-known initiatives worth billions of dollars, including Aave, Celer, Kava, and Matic. The team directly gave 1,000,000 CTK to the foundation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Main target</h2>



<p>The project team created a decentralized proof system that mathematically ensures the stated smart contract is error-free, resistant to hacker assaults, and functionally validated. This is accomplished via the use of a check mechanism. The project is a turnkey solution that makes use of certified kits. They include characteristics like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Smart labeling;</li>



<li>Class-based decomposition;</li>



<li>Proofing tool;</li>



<li>The proof object can test the machine;</li>



<li>Certified dApp library;</li>



<li>Custom certification service.</li>
</ul>



<p>These components safeguard smart contracts by marking critical portions of the code and their intended functionality, as well as breaking down the verification process into smaller jobs. All of the components are then reassembled into a fully operating and tested smart contract.</p>



<p>To accomplish the aforementioned aims, the project integrates the model with machine learning (deep learning) aspects. The system automates the procedure using machine learning and contextualizes its whole work history in the service of its own evolutionary learning. The platform will be able to mathematically describe and automatically categorize contracts based on their proper functionality in the future. This technology will allow for very accurate verification as well as dynamic, precise, and automated contract analysis. Nodes running the software validate the finished proofs.</p>



<p>CertiK is a protocol and smart contract auditing service. Its unique feature is that formal verification is automated, somewhat decentralized, and may be performed in any programming language.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>In general, all platforms and applications investigated, implemented, and created by CertiK will have the objective of measuring transaction safety.</p>



<p>Moreover, using this platform, apps will be able to make precise judgments about carrying out transactions that are part of the transaction.</p>



<p>Its operating system is comprised of the following core components:</p>



<ul>
<li>Business Chain: Certik Foundation will integrate Security Oracle as a bridge to assist the project in accessing information or data about transaction safety and reputation.</li>



<li>CertiK Chain: With this component, users will be provided CTK and will be required to register for tasks. At the same time, the Oracle Operator units will be coordinating activities to record the completed tasks on the chain.</li>
</ul>



<p>As a result, each Operator will be compared to the Primitive Operator in order to examine and re-check the whole safety. CertiK Chain will then submit the results to Security Oracle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Team</h2>



<p>CerrtiK was established in 2018 by two academics from prestigious US colleges. Their primary field of study is computer science.</p>



<ul>
<li>Professor Zhong Shao has worked at Yale University for about 25 years.</li>



<li>Professor Ronghui Gu has been teaching at Columbia University for over 5 years.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Investors and Partners</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors</strong></h3>



<p>Binance Labs was the first hedge fund to make an undisclosed investment in the project in 2018. It was funded by huge names like Coinbase, SoftBank, Goldman Sachs, and Sequoia after the fundraising calls.</p>



<p>CertiK obtained funds via two rounds of private sales (period not indicated), totaling $39.43 million. The audit company then increased Series B and prolonged Series B for a total of four hikes. It was valued at $2 billion in the most recent fundraising round.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partners</strong></h3>



<p>The ecosystem is fairly robust, with key industry partners like Bitman, Huobi, and OKX… on board.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Roadmap</h2>



<p>In recent years, the project team has been consistently boosting the platform&#8217;s quality and efficiency in order to meet pre-set goals such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>February 2021: Completely unlock 9% from the second Private Sale</li>



<li>April 2022: Increase the number of vacancies from the first Private Sales by 29%.</li>



<li>May 2023: Continue to completely unleash 10% of the team&#8217;s potential.</li>



<li>June 2023: Full unlocking with 25% from the Foundation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The CertiK platform is developed by a highly qualified and experienced team. Since smart contract technology is always evolving, the full potential of a project capable of comprehensively verifying smart contracts has yet to manifest. Since smart contracts regulate a large portion of the ecosystem&#8217;s assets, a certification process is essential to confirm that the code is valid and to avoid unanticipated losses or hacks.</p>



<p>CertiK automates the procedure and ensures constant quality. This will assure the ecosystem&#8217;s continuing evolution by offering a novel, rapid, and efficient method of qualitatively analyzing smart contracts.</p>



<p>It is intended to offer security not just for blockchain protocols, but also for any smart contract-based application. By utilizing CertiK&#8217;s technology, the team hopes to give developers and consumers with the tools they need to improve the security of their digital assets.</p>



<p>The project has the objective to become one of the most prominent initiatives. It has every possibility to collaborate with prominent crypto firms and decentralized exchanges to ensure the security of smart contracts in the area of decentralized finance. It&#8217;s simply a question of time, and investing in CTK is best-viewed long-term.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>China&#8217;s appointment of Pan Gongsheng as new leader raises questions about Bitcoin&#8217;s future, given his past skepticism and recent crackdowns on the cryptocurrency industry.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The Central Bank of China has recently <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23693599" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23693599" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>the appointment of its new leader, Pan Gongsheng. However, this appointment is notable not only for the change in leadership, but also because of Pan Gongsheng&#8217;s history of skepticism towards Bitcoin. In 2017, he made a now-famous statement: &#8220;Sit by the river and watch, one day, the corpse of Bitcoin will float in front of you.&#8221; This statement has resurfaced in light of his recent appointment, raising questions about what it means for the future of cryptocurrency in China.</p>



<p>During a <a href="https://finance.sina.cn/china/cjpl/2017-12-04/detail-ifypikwt6022160.d.html?from=wap" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://finance.sina.cn/china/cjpl/2017-12-04/detail-ifypikwt6022160.d.html?from=wap" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>, Pan Gongsheng praised the decision to shut down Bitcoin trading platforms and stop ICOs, calling it a &#8220;decisive and correct&#8221; move. He further cited an article by French scholar Eric Pichet, which compared the Bitcoin bubble to past examples of speculation like tulip mania and the internet bubble. Pichet argued that no one can predict the length of a speculative wave or where its peak will be. As Keynes famously said, &#8220;Markets can be irrational for long enough to bankrupt you.&#8221;</p>



<p>These statements from Pan Gongsheng and Pichet highlight the ongoing debate around the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. While some believe Bitcoin is a bubble waiting to burst, others argue it is a valuable asset with long-term potential.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at around $30,500, as shown by CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>.</p>

<p>Pan Gongsheng&#8217;s appointment as the new party secretary of the central bank raises questions about how China will regulate cryptocurrency going forward. As one of the world&#8217;s largest economies, China&#8217;s stance on cryptocurrency has significant implications for the global market. With the recent crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, it seems that China is taking a more aggressive approach towards regulating the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tenet Protocol is setting the stage for a disruptive ecosystem of products in the <a href="https://coincu.com/191618-lsdfi-top-6-potential-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquidity Staking Derivatives (LSDfi) </a>space. The company is leveraging its EVM-compatible layer 1 blockchain and harnessing the power of LSD housed in the Tenet validator network. If Tenet Protocol has something interesting, let&#8217;s find out in the article below.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Tenet Protocol?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20-1024x576.png" alt="Tenet Protocol Review: The Next Explosive Project In The LSDFi Trend" class="wp-image-199395" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-20.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Tenet Protocol Review: The Next Explosive Project In The LSDFi Trend 30"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Tenet Protocol is an EVM-oriented development platform Blockchain that uses Diversified Proof Of Stake consensus mechanism, meaning that users can use assets issued from LSD platforms as LST to deploy a validator on Tenet Protocol.</p>



<p>Tenet has taken an enormous step forward by acting as a liquidity black hole for LSD. By allowing LSD holders to delegate their LSD to Tenet validators, the protocol draws liquidity from all types of PoS blockchains, providing additional returns on already profitable assets.</p>



<p>Staking Providers active on the Tenet network can issue a tLSD (Tenet Liquid Staking Derivative) which represents LSDs staked to network validators. tLSDs combine two sources of yield and make them new collateral to be used in an expanding ecosystem of LSDfi-protocols.</p>



<p>Tenet Protocol employs veTokenomics at the chain level to direct emissions from block rewards and other dAPP user incentives. Users locking the Tenet asset in this mechanism receive yield from protocols deployed across the ecosystem.</p>



<p>LSDC is the native stablecoin of the Tenet blockchain and is minted against overcollateralized positions of tLSDs. This represents a third yield opportunity for capital deployed to Tenet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The difference between Tenet Protocol</h2>



<p>Although born after many LSDfi projects, however, Tenet Protocol has the following differences:</p>



<ul>
<li>Not only at Ethereum LSTs, but Tenet Protocol supports a basket of crypto assets such as ETH, ATOM, BNB, MATIC, ADA, and DOT.</li>



<li>The use of multiple tokens makes Tenet&#8217;s network decentralized and not controlled by VCs, Whales, etc., who own a single token.</li>



<li>As one of the rare LSDfis that go in the direction of Layer 1 development while the other protocols go in the direction of Collateralized Debt Position (CDP).</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Diversified Proof of Stake</h2>



<p>Proof of Stake is now cemented as the preferred consensus model for new blockchain adopters. The reduced fees and increased scalability it enables powerful smart contract economies. As a bonus, its low carbon impact appeals to corporations and media, which boost the odds of accelerated mainstream adoption. There needs to be more innovation in Proof of Stake models.</p>



<p>Tenet Protocol introduces a novel Proof of Stake framework which retains all of its benefits while increasing security compared to legacy PoS models. This is the dawn of Diversified Proof of Stake (DiPoS).</p>

<p>Diversified Proof of Stake allows network consensus to be reached by validators that stake a basket of assets. This removes the risk of the network being owned by a large controller of a single asset. The probability of a network attack decreases exponentially with each new asset class needed to maintain network control.</p>



<p>The consensus can approve additional assets that can participate in network security, but the genesis stake in network security is allocated to ETH, ATOM, BNB, MATIC, ADA, and DOT. Naturally, TENET is a key part of the basket.</p>



<p>The most important achievement of this model is its ability to enhance network security by evaluating the shared market strength and difficulty of mass control of a robust basket of assets. Any network attacker would need a significant market share in all of these assets.</p>



<p>This allows TENET – from its initiation – to be the most secure blockchain network. It benefits from the combined security of a basket of assets, which, when put together, are more secure than any individual asset in the basket, including ETH.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tenets Protocol products</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tenet Bridge &#8211; Powered by LayerZero</strong></h3>



<p>Currently, LSD is fragmented across different chains and between different wrappers. This results in a terrible user experience for those looking to move their LSD between chains to take advantage of new profit opportunities — such as the triple-tier returns available on Tenet.</p>



<p>Tenet&#8217;s bridge, developed in collaboration with LayerZero, solves this problem. Tenet&#8217;s bridging will allow the wrapping of LSDs from any chain into a single, unified OFT, which can then be seamlessly connected to any network that integrates LayerZero endpoints.</p>



<p>Tenet Bridge will be the first DeFi project we launch on Tenet and will open the door to connecting to Tenet and using other DAPPs built on top of the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tenet Stablecoin Protocol &#8211; LSDC</strong></h3>



<p>LSDC stands for Liquid Staking Dollar Coin and is a soft-pegged dollar stablecoin that is over-collateralized by LSDs. LSDC is created by the Tenet Stablecoin Protocol, a non-custodial decentralized application running on the Tenet blockchain. The protocol allows users to create interest-free loans against yield-bearing collateral assets.</p>

<p>This means that users of Tenet can bridge over their liquid staking derivatives from other networks, such as ETH, BNB, SOL or Matic, stake them to a Tenet validator to receive additional yield and then borrow against those yield bearing Tenet LSDs using the Tenet Stablecoin Protocols.</p>

<p>The Tenet Stablecoin Protocol creates a more capital efficient and user-friendly way to borrow stablecoins against a decentralised collateral base but goes even further in decentralizing the governance (and therefore security) of the protocol.</p>



<ul>
<li>Accepting only profitable capital allows its capitalization rate to remain low, resulting in better capital efficiency than other stablecoin protocols that do not accept profitable collateral;</li>



<li>Managed by holders of all accepted forms of collateral (using our unique consensus layer) and thus avoiding centralization of governance in a single token; And</li>



<li>Can be scaled to adopt any new LSD through our governance system (with Tenet having brought LSD into LSD-free networks to date).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Admin class veTenet</strong></h3>



<p>Tenet is the first blockchain to implement a voting escrow system at the chain level, where users can lock Tenet tokens to receive veTenet, have the power to direct the distribution of the original reward pool, and receive protocol revenue.</p>



<p>Keeping veTenet in your wallet will also allow increased returns on all your actions on the Tenet ecosystem — from staking on validators to providing liquidity on the DEX.</p>



<p>veTenet is an integrated and fundamental approach to operating and linking incentives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Meta LSD</strong></h3>



<p>We have seen an explosion in LSD innovation and experimentation with different types of token dynamics. This presents new challenges for LSDfi pioneers like Tenet. In addition to tLSDs, we will introduce LSD metas that combine different non-replaceable representations of LSD content in a single, composable basket.</p>



<p>The resulting token acts as a synthetic token representing a diverse portfolio of tLSDs. This consolidates liquidity into a single token, which can then be effectively used as DeFi collateral for stablecoin mining and other DeFi operations.</p>



<p>Meta LSD enables the efficient use of cross-chain tLSD to be the ultimate, profit-generating user asset used across the DeFi space — not just on the Tenet network. Aggregation of LSDs also encourages decentralization of validators on the network, benefiting users and protocols on Tenet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tokenomics</h2>



<ul>
<li>Tenet Protocol token information</li>



<li>Token Name: Tenet Protocol</li>



<li>Code: TENET</li>



<li>Blockchain: Tenet Protocol</li>



<li>Token classification: TE 20</li>



<li>Contract: 0x9663677b81c2d427e81c01ef7315ea96546f5bb1</li>



<li>Total supply: 1,200,000,000 VND</li>
</ul>



<p>When you lock TENET to be a validator on the Tenet Protocol network, you will receive tTENET then you hold the key tTENET for a minimum of 1 week and up to 4 years to receive veTENET.</p>



<p>When owning veTENET, users will have a number of benefits as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Network administrator rights.</li>



<li>Revenue sharing from protocols across the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Pros and cons of Tenet Protocol </h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Supports multiple native tokens from other blockchains.</li>



<li>Staking and receiving tLSDToken tokens as collateral allows Mint Stablecoin LSDC to participate in DeFi market and earn higher profits.</li>



<li>Offers interest-free LSDC loans based on Mint fees from 0.5% to 5% on network activity.</li>



<li>When conversion activity is high, fees are high and vice versa. This mechanism helps maintain the LSDC price.</li>



<li>The veToken model using the TENET governance token is awesome. As veTENET holders can participate in the index and share benefits, dumping of TENET Tokens can be prevented.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cons</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>When borrowing LSDC Stablecoin, there will be smart contract risk and initial asset liquidation risk.</li>



<li>Each new block generated will reward TENET Tokens, leading to inflation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Tenet Protocol is creating an ecosystem of products designed for the LSDfi space built on top of its EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain and benefits from the governance power of LSDs housed in the presenter network. Tenet authentication.</p>



<p>Tenet and other blockchain platforms adopt the PoS consensus mechanism and integrate the Project Governance Stake Token into the verifier to ensure the security of the network. Compared to networks like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Cosmos, Cardano, Polygon, Avalanche and Polkadot that accept LSD Token assets, Tenet is more advanced.</p>



<p>Investors participating in pledging assets will be accepted and issued tLSDToken tokens. This asset can be used as collateral for the Mint Stablecoin LSDC to further profit from the DeFi market.</p>



<p>It can be said that Tenet Protocol is one of the rare projects in the LSDfi industry that chooses a direction full of risks and challenges, but full of development opportunities.</p>
