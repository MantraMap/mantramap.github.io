Top trending meme coin $SPONGE is bouncing back strongly after the wider crypto crash sent meme coins lower. <br />
Helping $SPONGE today is the news of its launch on the Poloniex centralized exchange (CEX) at 11:00 UTC. <br />
The Poloniex listing means $SPONGE can now be traded on four CEXs. Yesterday $SPONGE listed on LBank and the day before that on CoinW and Toobit. <br />
There are very likely to be more listings for $SPONGE coming soon, possibly before the US session gets into gear....<br />
