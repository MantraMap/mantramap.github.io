A public test network for the Shanghai upgrade will be released by the end of February. The Shanghai upgrade has generated excitement among some due to the potential for competition between Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) after the upgrade. The LDO token, associated with the Lido DAO, has recently seen strong performance with a 71% increase in value [&#8230;]
