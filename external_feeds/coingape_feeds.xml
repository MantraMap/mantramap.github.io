<h2>Lawyer A Top Crypto Cop?</h2>
<p>Stephanie Avakian, a former enforcement division chief at the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a>, was also in charge of many of the agency&#8217;s most high-profile <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> prosecutions during her tenure over there.</p>
<p>Before joining the Washington DC-based law firm, WilmerHale, in 2020 — Stephanie served as the enforcement director for the SEC for a total of four years, during which she also served as the deputy director.</p>
<p>She shared the role of director with Steve Peikin, who is currently representing <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">FTX in its bankruptcy proceedings</a>. During their time in office, the regulatory body increased the amount of enforcement activity inside the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>As reported earlier on CoinGape, FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy team, Congress, regulators and <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-illegally-moved-millions-during-bankruptcy/">prosecutors from Manhattan</a> are investigating charges that billions of dollars in customer funds deposited at the exchange ended up being traded by Alameda, which is a Hong Kong-based sibling trading firm of the now defunct FTX empire.</p>
<h2>Stephanie&#8217;s Earlier Cases</h2>
<p>One of the cases that Stephanie reviewed earlier was that of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-xrp/">Ripple Labs</a>, a blockchain startup whose founders were charged with fraudulently generating $1.3 billion through the sale of unregistered securities backed by digital assets. The legality of crypto assets as securities is still up for discussion in the wake of the 2020 <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-files-final-submission-against-sec-lawyer-says-fighting-for-crypto/">SEC lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from the cryptocurrency sector, Stephanie was in charge of overseeing enforcement actions taken against General Electric, Robinhood Markets, and Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter.</p>
<h2>Negotiation In The Making?</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, who founded FTX and served as its previous chief executive officer, has pointed the finger of blame at Alameda in multiple interviews with the media.</p>
<p>In contrast, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/caroline-ellison-2538" rel="nofollow">Ellison</a> has maintained her silence thus far, lending credence to the notion that she may be negotiating a cooperation agreement with the relevant authorities.</p>

They have begun an investigation to determine whether or not SBF manipulated the prices of TerraUSD and Luna to benefit FTX and its associate trading firm, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>.</p>
<h2>Was Terra FUD Planned?</h2>
<p>However, there&#8217;s one more aspect to this whole drama. It&#8217;s being alleged that, SBF&#8217;s Alameda possibly hired a Twitter influencer who would later go on to spread lies about the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/luna/">Terra (LUNA)</a> project and its founder Do Kwon.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Going by the Twitter handle @fatmanterra, the profile has repeatedly spoken against the crypto project and about its eventual demise, pinning the faults on <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/do-kwon/">Do Kwon</a> and his team, Terraform Labs. The profile, however, remains anonymous.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a title="Terra Do Kwon, LUNC Community Reacts To Court Rejecting Arrest Warrants" href="https://coingape.com/terra-do-kwon-lunc-community-reacts-to-court-rejecting-arrest-warrants/" rel="bookmark">Terra Do Kwon Reacts To Court Rejecting Arrest Warrants</a></em></p>
<p>The pseudonymous &#8220;FatMan&#8221;, first gained prominence when he publicly claimed that he had &#8220;proofs&#8221; of Do Kwon&#8217;s malpractice in the infamous UST depeg.</p>
<h2>FatMan vs Do Kwon</h2>
<p>Although, many claim that his proofs have been debunked by other community members, the profile still sticks to his views and has continually spoken against the Terra founder.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I&#39;ve been using this account to document the Terra fraud, but there&#39;s a lot of info and it can be hard to parse. Here&#39;s a simple summary thread (linking to past tweets) outlining the key milestones in Do Kwon&#39;s destructive path of fraud &#8211; proving malice, greed, and crime.</p>
<p>&mdash; FatMan (@FatManTerra) <a href="https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1570317225482928134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The self-proclaimed &#8220;cryptocurrency &amp; finance researcher&#8221; has even denied the allegations of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sbf/">SBF</a> playing a role in the UST debacle of May 2022.</p>
<p>Instead, his latest tweet targets Terraform Labs for dumping their own $450 Million <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ust/">UST</a> into the market &#8212; thus leading to the<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/"> cryptocurrency&#8217;s</a> eventual demise.</p>

In the 3 weeks leading up to the depeg, one entity dumped over $450m of UST on the open market. 4 days after their last sale, UST started collapsing.</p>
<p>That entity? None other than Terraform Labs. Details inside. <a href="https://t.co/aFfzgpBZ5A">pic.twitter.com/aFfzgpBZ5A</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Do Kwon Opens Up</h2>
<p>The Terra founder believes that <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis-trading/">Genesis Trading</a> provided around $1 billion in UST to Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Alameda Research before the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/stablecoins-2/">stablecoin’s</a> depeg in order to carry out the infamous trade.</p>
<p>He further went on to state:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the time has come for GenesisTrading to reveal if they provided the $1B UST shortly before the crash to SBF..The large currency contraction that UST went through in Feb 2021 was started by Alameda. What’s done in darkness will come to light.</p></blockquote>

In an email to the Twitter staff, he warned against feeding detailed information to the media. Musk is also asking the employees to sign a pledge to confirm that they have understood the terms. He said such acts could amount to clearly violating the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that employees signed at the time of joining Twitter.</p>

<h2>Pledge Against Data Leak</h2>
<p>The Tesla CEO reportedly mentioned in his email about acting against the company&#8217;s interests. He said the various instances of detailed leaks of confidential Twitter information was a clear evidence of it. According to Platformer journalist <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1601582028100894721" rel="nofollow">Zoë Schiffer</a>, Musk had sent out a clear warning against media leaks. The warning comes after Musk recently reduced the company&#8217;s workforce by several thousands. He also introduced a string of rules around employee performance.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Breaking your word by sending detailed info to the media with the intent to harm Twitter will receive the response it deserves.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, Musk is said to have given Twitter employees as deadline until 5 pm at the end of the day on Saturday to respond to his email.</p>

<p>In a recent comment, the billionaire said a potential interest rate hike in the next Fed meeting would only make it worse for chances of recession. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet next between December 13 and 14, in what will be the last such policy meeting in 2022. <a href="https://coingape.com/elon-musk-warns-fed-hike-rate-will-amplify-recession/">Musk&#8217;s comment</a> follows his recent prediction that the recession could drag until 2024.</p>

However, people linked with the case have been facing different kinds of allegations. XRP holders’ lawyer has come out to defend his links with Ripple and its executives.</p>
<h2>XRP proving to be an alternative?</h2>
<p>John Deaton, XRP holders’ lawyer in <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-seeks-deadline-whales-move-143-million-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Ripple lawsuit</a> mentioned that he doesn’t argue with the people who say that Ripple helped to create a secondary market by giving the token to people. He added that he doesn’t challenge them as most of the projects have done the same.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor’s recent comments misrepresented the facts and theory. Deaton mentioned that Saylor claimed that Ripple and its executives have committed fraud and the XRP lawsuit against them involves Fraud.</p>
<p>He stated that the media houses like Foxbussines have called him a ‘no Ripple fan boy”.</p>
<p>He added that even if he believes that XRP is a shitcoin or the technology is inferior. However, it has proven to be a better layer 2 solution to the Bitcoin problem.</p>
<h2>SEC&#8217;s approach towards Ripple lawsuit</h2>
<p>XRP lawyer stated that the<a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1601378285086068738" target="_blank"> SEC’s approach toward the crypto</a> and presenting the Ripple lawsuit is absolutely appalling. He called the SEC truly become an innovation killing cesspool of corruption.</p>
<p>He pointed out that after a 30 month long investigation, the commission didn’t charge fraud or even misrepresentation against Ripple or any other executive.</p>

However, the latest fillings show that both parties requested the court to set a deadline for sealing the Summary Judgment Materials.</p>
<h2>Ripple seeks deadline in XRP lawsuit</h2>
<p>James Filan reported that Ripple and the US SEC asked the district court to set a deadline of January 4, 2023, for sealing portions related to the briefs. If not then waive any objections to the court’s ruling on the parties’ sealing application.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1601295709688381440" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ripple’s letter mentions</a> that the omnibus motions to seal the Parties are already due to be filed on December 22, 2022. It added that the parties will try to provide notice to all non parties whose confidential discovery documents will appear in the Summary Judgment materials. However, giving clarity regarding the sealing motion will give them an opportunity to redact those materials.</p>
<p>It added that the court earlier approved a similar process for addressing non-party sealing motions in relation to Daubert Motions.</p>
<h2>Are whales on an XRP buying spree?</h2>
<p>WhaleAlert reported that<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1601365789096833024" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> 143 million XRP tokens</a> (worth approx $55 million) were moved to an unknown wallet. This move landed after both parties filed for deadlines in the XRP lawsuit. However, <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-275-million-xrp-moved-amid-price-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP prices have surged</a> over the past 30 days. This price jump has come amid the recent decline in the crypto market.</p>
<p>XRP is trading at an average price of $0.387, at the press time. However, its price has dropped by around 2% over the past 24 hours. Its 24 hour trading volume stands at $515 million.</p>
<p>Coingape reported that over<a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-over-4-billion-xrp-moved-as-ripple-awaits-summary-judgment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 4 billion XRP tokens were moved</a> in multiple transactions from the Bittrex crypto exchange.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Whales Dumping Their BTC Holdings</h2>
<p>Whale Alert in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1601295611168538626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on December 10 revealed that a whale has transferred 9,901 BTC worth $170 million to crypto exchange Kraken.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qxv55wuzz4qsfgss3uq2zwg5y88d7qv5hg67d2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On-chain data</a> reveals the Bitcoin whale purchased 9,901 BTC for $391.91 million on July 29, 2021. The BTCs remain unmoved since the date and the wallet has no other transactions. The whale has sold the Bitcoin holdings for a loss of $222 million.</p>

<p>Analyst <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1600823495981670400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ali Martinez</a> has also shared that around 33 whales holding 1,000 to 100,000 <span class="link-complex-target">BTCs</span> have left the network. In fact, these whales sold or redistributed around 20,000 <span class="link-complex-target">BTC</span> in the last 96 hours. Now, there are only 2037 wallets holding 1,000 to 100,000 <span class="link-complex-target">BTCs.</span></p>
<p>However, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1600946173564502016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santiment</a> on-chain data platform tweeted that the supply of Bitcoin and Ethereum on crypto exchanges are now at a 4-year low. Thus, it indicates a lower sell-off risk.</p>
<p>As reported in a previous article, <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-prediction-on-chain-data-indicates-whales-still-selling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whales are still selling</a> their BTC holdings. Whales continued to reduce their Bitcoin holdings since June 2022 and sold nearly 367k BTC. Moreover, whales with 1k-10k BTC continued to liquidate their Bitcoin holdings during the <a href="https://coingape.com/slow-down-btc-mining-hamper-bitcoins-short-term-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miner capitulation phase</a> until November. Therefore, traders must observe whales increasing their BTC holdings to confirm a Bitcoin rally.</p>

<h2>BTC Price Risks Falling to $12.8K</h2>
<p>Analysts such as <a href="https://coingape.com/popular-analysts-predict-bitcoin-and-ethereum-prices-for-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael van de Poppe and “Wolf of the Wall Street” Jordan Belfort</a> believe Bitcoin can rally if it crosses $18k, suggesting $16.5k as a critical support level. However, the BTC price has failed to pass even $17.3k and on-chain data predicts <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-on-chain-data-analysts-predict-upside-level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$18k is a strong resistance level</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, miner capitulation and whales selling their BTC holdings indicate uncertainty. On-chain predicts that BTC price can bottom at $12.8k, the delta price for Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Elon Musk predicted a recession</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, in October, Elon Musk predicted that the recession would last &#8220;until the spring of 24.&#8221; In October, the Twitter account Tesla Owners Silicon Valley asked Elon Musk how long he thought the recession would last, and he replied, &#8220;Just guessing, but probably until spring of 24.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to economists, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/u-s-federal-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> will likely announce the final hike of 2022 in the coming week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also hinted that the central bank&#8217;s benchmark interest rate will most likely be raised by a smaller increment when it meets next week. However, whether the rate hike is 0.5 or 0.75 percentage points is in doubt. The US Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rates will be announced on December 14.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve last month announced a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate hike in November in an effort to tame inflation.</p>
<h3>Economists view on recession</h3>
<p>Many economists believe that a recession is more likely in 2023 as a result of continued rate increases discouraging borrowing. 42 economists responding to a Bloomberg survey estimate that the likelihood of a recession over the upcoming year has increased to 60%.</p>
<p>Between October and November, the cost of goods increased just 0.1%, while wholesale gas prices fell by 6%. (Food prices were an exception; they rises 3.3% last month as a result of higher-priced chicken, eggs, and vegetables.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the cost of services rises more, by 0.4%, primarily as a result of higher financial service prices. The consumer price index, the US government&#8217;s most widely known inflation indicator, will be released. Prices were up 7.7% from a year ago in the most recent CPI report for October, which showed a moderating of <a href="https://coingape.com/the-fed-reveals-when-inflation-will-be-curbed-fully/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation</a>. That was the lowest comparison figure since January, despite the fact that it was still high.</p>

Meanwhile, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried agrees to testify before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, but with some conditions.</p>
<h2>Prosecutors Probe SBF For Fund Transfers During Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Prosecutors looking for a fraud case against Sam Bankman-Fried and others involved in the collapse of cryptocurrency giant FTX. Transactions have revealed that funds held by FTX moved outside the U.S. while the firm was filing bankruptcy, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-10/us-probes-ftx-founder-for-fraud-examines-cash-flows-to-bahamas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> Bloomberg on December 10.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are investigating whether SBF, FTX, or any related parties illegally transferred millions of dollars to the Bahamas during the bankruptcy filing in Delaware on November 11.</p>
<p>The U.S. Dept. of Justice (DOJ) is investigating how FTX handled its customers&#8217; cash and assets. The DOJ officials met with court-appointed overseers to collect evidence materials related to the FTX probe. The investigation team is also looking into transactions between FTX and Alameda. SBF says he wasn&#8217;t involved with Alameda or denies knowingly misappropriating customer funds. However, transactions revealed Alameda and FTX operations were commingled with each other.</p>
<p>The meeting was held between officials from federal attorneys, Justice Department, the FBI, and the bankruptcy team led by new FTX CEO John J. Ray III, and FTX lawyers. It also included former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement director Steve Peikin and former Manhattan federal prosecutor Nicole Friedlander.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-to-be-arrested-during-house-testimony-visit-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBF on Friday agreed to testify</a> before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on December 13 and Senate Banking Committee on December 14. Former trial attorney CFTC Braden Perry believes SBF could be taken into custody if he enters the U.S.</p>
<h2>SBF and Alameda Behind the Terra-LUNA Crisis?</h2>
<p>Prosecutors are also investigating whether Sam Bankman-Fried with its hedge fund Alameda was engaged in market manipulation that led to the Terra-LUNA crisis.</p>
<p>Terra co-founder <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-do-kwon-sbf-genesis-terra-luna-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Kwon blamed SBF, Alameda, and Genesis Trading</a> for the UST depeg. He revealed Alameda borrowed billions in UST and Bitcoin from Genesis, Voyager, and other firms to manipulate prices and shorted Terra (LUNA) after the depeg.</p>
