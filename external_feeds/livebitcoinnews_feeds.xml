<li>Bitcoin price started a fresh increase above the $27,500 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $27,500 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $28,000 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $27,400 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is showing positive signs above $28,000 against the US Dollar. BTC might correct lower but dips could be limited below the $27,400 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">steady increase</a> from the $25,000 support zone. The price gained and cleared many hurdles near the $26,500 and $27,000 levels.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $27,500 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). The price even rallied above the $28,000 resistance zone. However, the bears were active near the $29,000 zone. A high was formed near $29,050 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>
<p>The price traded below $28,800 but is well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $24,750 swing low to the $29,050 high. The price is now trading well above $27,500 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-soon-revisit-28500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $29,000 level. The first major resistance is near the $29,250 level, above which the price could rise toward the $30,000 zone.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send the price toward the $31,200 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a downside correction below $28,500.</p>
<p>The next key support is near the $28,000 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $28,000 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $27,400 support zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $24,750 swing low to the $29,050 high.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, the world watched in horror as one of the most <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/twitter-hack-leads-to-120000-in-stolen-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">prominent crypto scams</a> to ever occur on Twitter unfolded before their very eyes.</p>
<h2>Man Faces Prison for Twitter Crypto Hack in 2020</h2>
<p>Many high-profile accounts – including those of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and former president Barack Obama – were hacked and featured posts about a phony bitcoin giveaway. The person committing the crime announced that anyone who sent BTC to specific addresses would see their money doubled. This, sadly, didn’t happen, and those who sent their money in merely saw it disappear from their digital wallets. The hacker made off with more than $120K in BTC before getting caught.</p>
<p>It later turned out that the culprit <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/graham-clark-revealed-as-the-alleged-twitter-btc-perpetrator/" data-wpel-link="internal">was 17 years old</a>. He agreed to a plea bargain that would see him spend three years in a juvenile detention center. Up to this point, it was always thought that he acted alone, though today, a new suspect has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-bitcoin-scam-elon-musk-joe-biden-man-pleads-guilty-2023-5" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">been taken into custody for</a> being part of the scam. 23-year-old Joseph James O’Connor – who was only 20 when he took part in the Twitter attack – is a British citizen who was found in Spain and was extradited to the U.S. to face his sentencing.</p>
<p>At the time of the attack, roughly 130 Twitter accounts were singled out by O’Connor and his cronies. In addition, the account of Binance – the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange – also saw its account overtaken by the hackers. Upon noticing what was going on, Twitter was quick to issue a halt to the activity and put out the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to taking part in the Twitter hack, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued a statement saying that O’Connor and his pals were engaged in various SIM-swapping hacks that allowed them to gain control of users’ phones so they could access further crypto accounts from there. Lastly, it is believed O’Connor also blackmailed an unnamed public figure with private Snapchat photos and stole close to $800,000 in crypto from an anonymous business.</p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. – who has a knack for always being involved in crypto-related scam cases – commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s criminal activities were flagrant and malicious, and his conduct impacted multiple people&#8217;s lives. He harassed, threatened, and extorted his victims, causing substantial emotional harm.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Not Privy to the Same Plea Conditions</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, O’Connor has entered a guilty plea, though as a legal adult, he will not be privy to the same conditions as his partner three years ago.</p>
<p>He will be sentenced later in the month and is facing more than 70 years behind bars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other mainstream forms of crypto <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/10/have-the-floodgates-opened-excitement-building-as-10-trillion-crypto-price-earthquake-looms-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum/?sh=48016bdf51cb" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">are gaining a lot</a> of traction and additional popularity as the banking crisis grows.</p>
<h2>Crypto Is Getting a Lot of Respect</h2>
<p>Not long ago, one of the banks to join the ongoing list of financial <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/first-republic-bank-is-gone-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">failures was First Republic</a>. The organization’s assets were doled out by government officials to JPMorgan Chase, a monetary giant that also played a similar role in the Great Recession banking crisis of 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>The fact remains that the world of standard finance is getting quite shaky under Biden and his incompetent, democrat cronies, and there are many people who no longer feel as confident in standard banks as they once did. They’re turning to bitcoin and crypto to keep their financials safe and sound, and this is an attitude that appears to be growing every day.</p>
<p>Elliot Han – the head of crypto, blockchain, and digital asset investment at Cantor Fitzgerald – commented in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re seeing a lot more maturity. Now, have the floodgates opened? No, I don’t think so, but I think you see a lot more that has come into the [space]. You’re seeing a lot more experimentation.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also pointed to the idea that crypto regulation is getting closer and closer. The calls for regulation have been growing intensely over the past several months given the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">crash of FTX</a>, one of the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchanges. Bradley Duke – co-chief executive at ETC Group – commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>While a well-conceived regulatory framework for crypto will improve investor confidence and encourage enterprise and job creation, the opposite – a lack of a framework for crypto – creates uncertainty and the retraction of the sector as we are seeing in the U.S. today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, crypto regulation – while important – is non-existent, and taking on more of a bullying form through organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency has long been criticized for its ways of enforcing its will upon crypto companies rather than trying to reason with them or work things out with the industry. Rather, it’s made a habit of going after all major crypto firms and trying to force them into conditions that the SEC – and only the SEC – sees fit.</p>
<h2>The SEC is a Bully</h2>
<p>Among the companies the agency has targeted are Coinbase and Kraken. The former received a Wells notice <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">from the agency informing</a> it that it would likely face charges in the coming future, while Kraken was made to part with a $30 million penalty fee and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">cease all its crypto staking</a> activities and services.</p>
<p>Coinbase took serious issue with the notice in that representatives claim to have met with SEC heads roughly 30 times over a nine-year period to ensure the company was fully compliant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An IIT Kanpur student named Shubransh Nayak and several <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/thane-naupada-police-detains-iit-kanpur-student-and-his-associate-in-cryptocurrency-fraud/ar-AA1aXBfv" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">of his friends were detained</a> by Naupada police after evidence emerged they were involved in a crypto fraud scheme.</p>
<h2>Naupada Police Investigate Crypto Scam</h2>
<p>A police report issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The initial complaint is of ₹2.5 lakh, but the scam could burgeon to several crores since we are expecting more complainants  to approach us.</p></blockquote>
<p>The trouble began when Sushil Kangya and several other residents of the Naupada area began sending complaints to police authorities saying they had been victimized by the crypto companies Dronx.Biz and BNB Pool. The residents said they had lost money to assorted scammers and needed help in retrieving their funds back.</p>
<p>Kangya said he and his sister were approached by Nayak and his associate Pankaj Pandhi and were offered a chance to invest in a crypto platform that would ultimately grant them eight percent in returns each day. They were also told these returns would increase if more people chose to get involved in the scheme.</p>
<p>This should have been a huge red flag for the parties in question given that crypto returns can never be guaranteed. Thus, it’s impossible to assume that one will – for sure – get any sort of specific funds back when they invest in the industry given how volatile and speculative it can be.</p>
<p>Kangya explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Initially, we invested ₹ 2.5 lakhs and got returns for a few months. Later, the returns stopped. When we asked Shubhransh and Pankaj about non-payment of the returns, they showed us a few videos of the prime minister allegedly promoting the organizations and that the companies were genuine.</p></blockquote>
<p>There were several allegedly phony promotions about the company saying that it had the support of India’s prime ministry and various government members, but these have not been verified. Kangya continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we realized that it was a scam, we asked for the refund of our money, but we were threatened with dire consequences.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sanjay Dhumal – the senior police inspector at the Naupada police station who’s been investigating the case – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We received the letter from complainant Sushil Kangya against two companies named DRONX BIZ and DRONX BNB Pool which are into MLM and [were] involved in a cryptocurrency scam. The names of people running it are Rajesh Bapodra, a diamond merchant who lives in Kandivali; Krish Reddy, alias Phanni Beejam from Hyderabad; Shubhransh Nayak; Dr. Peter Dhanraj; Avinash Upadhyay; and Pankaj Pandhi. Based on the complaint lodged by Kangya, we have detained them for [an] investigation. As of now, no FIR has been registered against them.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Many Crypto Problems!</h2>
<p>Crypto crime has become rather rampant in the past few years.</p>
<p>Scams like these are also particularly common and often take on the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">form of romantic partners</a> looking for dates.</p>

<li>The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.265 and $0.288 levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is recovering higher above $0.25 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.265 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, Cardano price saw a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-bulls-aim-fresh-increase-to-0-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">major decline</a> from well above $0.320 against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair traded below the $0.30 and $0.288 support levels to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The bears even pushed the price below $0.25. A low is formed near $0.230 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $0.250 and $0.255 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $0.3821 swing high to the $0.2300 low.</p>
<p>Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.260 on the 4-hour chart. ADA price is now trading below $0.288 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.265 zone. The next major resistance is near the $0.288 level. A clear move above the $0.288 resistance might start a steady increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise toward the $0.300 resistance or the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $0.3821 swing high to the $0.2300 low.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.252 level. The next major support is near the $0.250 level. A clear move below the $0.250 level might send the price toward the $0.230 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $0.205 support, below which the bears could aim for a test of $0.200.</p>

<p><em>Ethereum price is rising above the $1,720 level against the US Dollar. ETH/USD could rise further if it clears the $1,760 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Ethereum saw a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-consolidates-below-key-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bearish wave</a> from the $1,900 zone against the US Dollar. ETH price declined below the $1,800 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The bears even pushed the price below the $1,700 level. A low was formed near $1,620 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1,680 resistance level. The price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,898 swing high to the $1,620 low.</p>
<p>There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,725 on the 4-hours chart. It is now trading above $1,720 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,760 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-turns-red-below-1850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">downward move</a> from the $1,898 swing high to the $1,620 low.

<p>Any more gains could even send the price toward the $1,900 resistance zone or $1,920 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $1,700 level. The next major support is now near the $1,680 level.</p>
<p>A break below the $1,680 support could push the price to $1,620. Any more losses could lead the price toward $1,550 or even $1,500 in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trade Station Group, Inc. – a company in Florida that provides self-clearing online brokerage services for trading options, futures, stocks, and digital currencies – is joining hands with the University of Miami to help the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tradestation-announces-title-sponsorship-university-130000203.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">organization launch its first</a> ever Business of Blockchain Technology Conference, an event that will be devoted entirely to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> and crypto-based initiatives.</p>
<h2>Trade Station Pushes Miami&#8217;s Crypto Agenda</h2>
<p>The event will be presented by AIS SIGBIT and the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School. It will take place in Coral Gables, Florida.</p>
<p>For the past several years, Trade Station has been a state leader in the advancement of digital currency and blockchain education, training, and investing. With nearly four decades of experience under its belt, the company seeks to help financial investors find edges that allow them to stay ahead of the monetary game and keep competitive streaks going as long as possible.</p>
<p>John Bartleman – president and chief executive officer of Trade Station – commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the premier sponsor for Miami Herbert&#8217;s inaugural Business of Blockchain Technology Conference, we are thrilled to support this highly relevant gathering. This event paves the way for an insightful discourse on the obstacles presented by blockchain models that hold sway across multiple industries.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conference will also serve as a forum for international academics and policymakers to talk about the upcoming blockchain research initiatives they’re involved with. They’ll also discuss things like best practices for financial decentralization and how they can be enhanced through blockchain.</p>
<p>Ola Henfridsson – professor and associate dean of online business programs at Miami Herbert Business School – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are proud to have Trade Station be a title sponsor of our first-ever Business of Blockchain Technology Conference. As Miami continues to flourish as a prominent tech hub, we eagerly anticipate a long-lasting and fruitful relationship with Trade Station.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conference will kick off at the hands of James Putra, the vice president and group head of product management at Trade Station Group. He will provide the opening remarks, while Meena Mani – senior vice president of brokerage and crypto product development – will take part in a panel soon after.</p>
<h2>40 Years of Experience</h2>
<p>Last year, Trade Station became an official fintech sponsor of the University of Miami’s athletics department. In its role, the company was featured across all the UM athletics ventures. The company has also provided individual or separate education programs to students, faculty, fans, and alumni to help them trade better and make more focused investing decisions.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 1982 and has won multiple awards for all the work it’s done over the last 41 years. In 2022, the company commissioned what’s come to be known as the Miami bull, a large statue in the city commemorating its growing financial arena.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mathieu Michel – the digital minister of Belgium – is <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/belgium-digital-minister-eu-crypto-blockchain-092425913.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">confident that what the</a> European Union (EU) has in store for bitcoin, crypto, and blockchain will be huge not just for the continent, but for the world.</p>
<h2>Mathieu Michel Discusses the Prospects of the EU&#8217;s Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Not long ago, the region of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">Europe announced that</a> it was preparing a whole new string of high-end crypto regulations. Known as Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), the regulations are set to bring about a whole new level of trust in blockchain and crypto that nobody has ever seen before. These regulations will be the first of their kind and will take full shape somewhere between 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p>Michel explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new MiCA bill will boost the crypto industry in Europe because Europeans are really strong on building regulation, and the purpose of this regulation is always to build trust. There are lots of opportunities for blockchain in the way value is exchanged, but it [needs] to be done in a trusted ecosystem, which is why MiCA has the power to unleash the potential of this industry. If you think that crypto is just a currency, this is a bad way to identify crypto assets. Many people only see crypto assets as a financial tool. I see them as a way we can exchange values and a way we can protect privacy. The EU will use MiCA to bring order to crypto through regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michel further said that these regulations are not designed to give the EU a competitive advantage, but rather to expand innovation in the crypto space by ensuring it&#8217;s safe and trustworthy for all. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It will help us develop a strong crypto ecosystem because we have a lot of talent in Europe that understands the next wave of innovation will be web3.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Europe to Have Its Own Blockchain?</h2>
<p>In addition, the continent is looking to ensure it develops what Michel calls “concrete” blockchain applications within the next year or so. One of those applications will be called Europeum, a blockchain specifically built for and tailored to the European way of life. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Belgium will have the EU presidency in 2024, and one of my goals then will be to transform the European blockchain concept from a technical project into a political project, to create concrete applications for the blockchain, pioneering digital wallets and digital identity. I have suggested the idea of a European blockchain, called Europeum, for digital payments and smart contracts. The need for a European blockchain arises from concerns over the dependence on foreign technology providers and the potential risks associated with that. It would have several advantages…Additionally, a European blockchain could provide greater security and privacy for transactions, as well as offering benefits such as transparency and efficiency.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is beginning to appear bullish again in <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-janet-yellen-warns-us-of-cash-june-101930054.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">several technical charts after</a> Janet Yellen – the present U.S. Treasury Secretary – said it was Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling… or else.</p>
<h2>Janet Yellen Wants the Debt Ceiling Raised</h2>
<p>Yellen warned that this could be the month in which the United States runs out of money if Congress didn&#8217;t act quickly. The problem with raising the debt ceiling was that it’s already high enough as it is. Right now, the ceiling stands beyond the $31 trillion point, and Biden isn’t helping the situation given the high number of trillion-dollar spending bills he signed his name to.</p>
<p>Actions like these have caused record inflation and placed the American economy in a very unstable place over the past year and a half. The idea that this isn’t enough for Yellen is scary, and raising the debt ceiling could lead to more problems than solutions if not handled properly, and let’s just say it… What <em>has</em> been handled properly since Biden and his group of nation-hating cronies took their present positions in the American government?</p>
<p>In an interview, Yellen stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the debt ceiling is not raised by June, the Treasury would then find itself in the position where it is unable to pay all of the bills that are due that day, and this would be the first time in the history of America that we would fail to make payments that are due. Whether this is to default on interest payments, or [a] payment for social security recipients, we would simply not have enough cash to meet all our obligations, so it is widely agreed that financial and economic chaos would then ensue. It&#8217;s Congress&#8217; job to do this and if they fail to do it, we will have an economic and financial catastrophe that will be of our own making.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the time this speech was made, bitcoin was trading in the mid-$27K range, a clear dip from where it was the month prior. The world’s number one digital currency by market cap had been slightly higher before, but endured a short period of suffering <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/binance-halted-withdrawals-in-mid-may-btc-temporarily-fell/" data-wpel-link="internal">after Binance announced</a> that it was temporarily halting all withdrawals involving the asset due to high traffic.</p>
<h2>Trying to Keep Their Holdings Secure</h2>
<p>However, analysts say the amount of bitcoin that’s been removed from exchanges and placed in cold storage over the past few weeks is a good sign. It suggests traders are confident the price of the asset could rise, and they want to keep their assets safe in the hopes that price surges will occur soon.</p>
<p>In addition, they’re pointing to data that says many long-term bitcoin holders are now suddenly working to increase their holdings exponentially, suggesting even further that these individuals are confident in bitcoin’s bullish potential.</p>
