					<description><![CDATA[There are encouraging on-chain activities in Cardano. According to Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, on August 14, there were 25,294 wallet addresses with at least 100,000 ADA, the highest in over 16 months. The uptick could signal interest, especially considering that prices are under pressure looking at the performance in the daily chart.  ADA Whales Accumulating Looking at Santiment trends, it appears that ADA whales began accumulating as early as June 2022, and the number has been rising steadily ever since. However, amid this encouraging &#8220;bullish&#8221; signal, ADA prices have fluctuated, edged lower, and diverged with whales&#8217; actions in the past 16 months. ADA is changing hands at around $0.289 at spot rates, down from $0.465 when whales began loading up in mid-June 2022, as seen below.  There are over 25,000 whales with at least 100,000 ADA of writing in mid-August, up by over 3,000 since June 2022. Overall, and as aforementioned, this is a vote of confidence for Cardano and may signal optimism in how ADA&#8217;s future prices could pan out.  Related Reading: Michael Burry’s Massive $1.6 Billion Short: Is A $DXY Collapse The Catalyst For A Crypto Bloodbath? In crypto, token holders closely monitor whale activity, as their actions often influence market sentiment. Their continued accumulation, for example, of ADA, is an endorsement of a project&#8217;s potential and could ignite demand, lifting prices. Conversely, when they offload, it could trigger a sell-off, forcing asset prices lower. ADA whales are buying more of the coin when Cardano&#8217;s market capitalization has been pulling back from 2023 highs. At spot rates, the project&#8217;s market cap is down by at least 35%, dropping from $15.76 billion to $10.1 billion as of mid-August. Even so, ADA is one of the most liquid coins looking at the average daily trading volumes and position in the leader board.  Cardano Building, ADA Resilient But Weak Presently ranked eighth, Cardano is ahead of Solana and Tron but trailing XRP and Dogecoin in the top 10. ADA is trading at $0.289, down roughly 10% from August 2023 highs. While ADA remains within the June to July 2023 trading range, ADA buyers hold an advantageous position looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Despite recent lower lows, sellers have not yet reversed the gains of July 13, a conspicuous bar that shapes the immediate price action.

Cardano is in the Basho era, where developers look at enhancing scalability and network performance to support intensive decentralized applications (dapps), particularly those in decentralized finance (DeFi).

					<description><![CDATA[According to Bloomberg, a recent research report from Sanford C. Bernstein has shed light on the potential impact of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on the Bitcoin market dynamics. Related Reading: Silent Bitcoin Storm: Glassnode Uncovers What Lies Beneath The Surface Potential Surge In Bitcoin Market Value Sanford C. Bernstein&#8217;s research indicates that should the US green-light a fund investing directly in spot Bitcoin, ETFs could constitute roughly 10% of Bitcoin&#8217;s market value within the next three years. Such a shift could amplify Bitcoin&#8217;s presence in traditional financial portfolios and potentially foster more significant institutional adoption. According to Bloomberg, Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, highlighted the rising probability of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the report. In a separate report, this same analyst had recently disclosed that the SEC believes that a Bitcoin Spot ETF may be &#8220;unreliable&#8221; since crypto exchanges (such as Coinbase) aren&#8217;t under their oversight, leading to concerns about potential price manipulation and unreliability. While the speculation on the SEC approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF continues, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust currently holding about 4% of all Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg, a direct investment, ETF could more than double this figure, potentially aiding the growth of the crypto investment landscape. The “Growth Flywheel” Effect Once regulatory approval is in place, Bernstein anticipates a &#8220;growth flywheel&#8221; effect propelled by retail and other institutional inflows. Such a cascade effect would be reminiscent of other financial markets where introducing new financial products spurred fresh investments and liquidity waves. Notably, to understand the significance of this, one only needs to consider the broader ETF market&#8217;s growth trajectory. Since their inception, ETFs have grown exponentially, with assets under management surging across various sectors and asset classes. Introducing a Spot Bitcoin ETF would mean integrating a highly liquid, decentralized, and increasingly accepted asset into this mix, further validating Bitcoin&#8217;s place in the financial ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is struggling to break above the $30,000 mark after slipping below that price range last week. As of this writing, the asset trades at $29,623, recording a slight increase of 0.5% over the past 24 hours. Alongside its struggling price, BTC’s market capitalization has increased by more than $10 billion in just the past week. The asset market cap has surged from a high of $560 billion earlier last week to a current cap of $573 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Addresses In Loss Soar To One-Month High Amid Mixed Market Indicators The top crypto&#8217;s trading volume has also followed closely with its surging market cap and has seen a significant spike from last week&#8217;s daily trading volume.

					<description><![CDATA[While Bitcoin and the crypto market experienced, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu and the memecoin sector are blooming. Recent data points to double-digit gains across the board for these assets, with the potential for further profits if Bitcoin and larger cryptocurrencies continue trading sideways. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rally Ahead? This Positive Correlation Data Points To A Potential 20% Jump For DOGE As of this writing, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu trades at $0.14, with profits of around 30% during the last 24 hours. On the previous seven days, the token saw a 54% profit, but the last month has been the best in performance, with a 246% increase. HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu Leads Memecoin Sector’s Gains As Bitcoin Acts Like A Stock Data from market tracker CoinGecko indicates that HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu’s gains have been followed by ElmoERC and DogeKaki. These cryptocurrencies experienced 10% and 11% rallies’ respectively. Other cryptocurrencies that experienced positive price action in the memecoin sector include Mooncat CAT and Mog Coin. The last of these tokens recorded a 17% increase over the past hour and at the time of writing alone. As Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other significant cryptocurrencies trend sideways, traders are attracted to riskier and volatile assets. In addition, these tokens experienced more volatility as they possessed less trading volume and liquidity. In other words, smaller traders can influence the price action on some of these assets. While on Bitcoin, and even Dogecoin (DOGE), traders need billions of dollars to influence the price action. When Will The Bitcoin Price Move Again? But how long can traders in the memecoin sector benefit from a low volatility environment? Per a recent update from Bitfinex Alpha, the current status quo is bound to persist. As seen in the chart below, there has been a record-low liquidation in the derivatives sector, and as a result, prices have remained steady. Traders should look out for catalyst events in the macroeconomics landscape and a potential liquidation spike if they are betting on HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu and other memecoins. Related Reading: Silent Bitcoin Storm: Glassnode Uncovers What Lies Beneath The Surface If the spike finally comes through, Bitcoin’s price could finally move again, crushing memecoins and the altcoins market. The Bitfinex Alpha report stated: (…) the low volatility regime should continue for a while. The lack of futures liquidations, euphoria and pain in the markets are also the reason for lack of any significant orderflow developments as the BTC price continues to range sideways even after breaking down from a significant range between $29,500 and $31,500.

<p>If the spike finally comes through, Bitcoin’s price could finally move again, crushing memecoins and the altcoins market. The Bitfinex Alpha report stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>(…) the low volatility regime should continue for a while. The lack of futures liquidations, euphoria and pain in the markets are also the reason for lack of any significant orderflow developments as the BTC price continues to range sideways even after breaking down from a significant range between $29,500 and $31,500.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[In the ongoing market turbulence on higher timeframes, Bitcoin (BTC) is at a crucial juncture as a great consolidation phase persists. Research and analysis firm Material Indicators closely monitored the recent weekly candle close/open, paying particular attention to two key factors: the trend line and the 21-day, 21-week, and 21-month moving averages (MA) – all of which are currently influential in shaping market dynamics.  Uncertainty And Potential Turning Point For Bitcoin The opening of the weekly candle below the trend line triggered a “subsequent nosedive,” amplifying concerns. While the 21-week and 21-month moving averages continue to serve as robust support, the 21-day MA has faced a rigorous seven-day testing period, according to the firm’s analysis.  Notably, the tight correlation of the 21-MA across three distinct time frames is rare, indicating that the market is at a critical inflection point.  Despite the compressed volatility witnessed in recent days, the price action observed over the past 24 hours exemplifies the market&#8217;s attempt to shake out weak hands. According to Material Indicators, given the complexity of the current price action, it is prudent to zoom out and gain a broader perspective. Both Trend Precognition algorithms identified these moves on the four-hour chart, emphasizing the significance of adopting a comprehensive outlook. Moreover, according to Materials, the order book reveals a concerning trend in bid liquidity, with less than $40 million holding the price up.  The absence of substantial liquidity below this level raises fundamental worries. However, it also suggests that there may not be sufficient sentiment to drive prices significantly lower – at least not yet.  Related Reading: XRP Volume Jolt: How Did The $3 Billion Surge Impact Price Action? In addition, Material Indicators highlights that the examination of liquidity movements within the order book over the past month paints a picture of continued price volatility with a potential upward bias.  However, the lack of volume raises concerns about the market&#8217;s overall health. Despite a $13 million buy wall at $27,900, the bottom of the channel at $28,300 remains a critical threshold for BTC to extend its current trend. The firm claims: &#8230; the bottom of the channel at $28.3k remains my line in the sand for BTC to extend the trend, and I maintain that we must see weekly candles printing above the 100-Week MA to even consider a bull breakout. BCT Faces Renewed Pressure Amid Strengthening US Dollar As Bitcoin enters a new week of trading, market participants closely monitor the potential impact of the strengthening US Dollar Index ($DXY) on the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency.  According to Yan Alleman, co-founder of blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, recent developments suggest that BTC may face renewed pressure due to the upward momentum of the $DXY. Alleman highlights that the $DXY&#8217;s renewed strength could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the value of the US Dollar and the price of BTC, meaning that when the dollar strengthens, Bitcoin often faces headwinds.  However, options pricing indicates a bullish sentiment for Bitcoin in the coming month. Options are financial derivatives that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin.  The pricing of options contracts suggests an expectation of a bullish move shortly. This aligns with the technical analysis indicating potential upside for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? Analyzing the potential price movements, Alleman notes that it would require nearly twice as much selling pressure to push Bitcoin down to the low $28,000 range compared to the buying pressure needed to surpass the $30,000 level.  This observation suggests that there may be greater support and buying interest at higher price levels, making a sustained drop less likely. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,500, reflecting a marginal 0.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

		<title>BALD Deployer Moves Proceeds Of The Rug From Base To Ethereum</title>

					<description><![CDATA[In a shocking turn of events, the developer behind the controversial meme coin BALD initiated a series of significant transactions, raising eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community. The events surrounding the deployer’s recent actions have left both the coin&#8217;s value and its reputation teetering on the edge. BALD Deployers Send Funds To Kraken Exchange Blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain has revealed that the deployer of the BALD token has executed audacious moves, bridging a staggering 7,000 ETH ($12.9 million) out of the Coinbase Layer 2 network, Base. Of the 7,000 ETH that has been sent to the Ethereum network, the deployer sent 2,100 ETH ($3.87 million) in two different transactions to the Kraken crypto exchange, for purposes that can only be for selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin-Friendly Javier Milei Wins Presidential Primaries In Argentina Following this, the BALD deployer currently holds 4,902 ETH in their balance on the Ethereum blockchain, worth over $9 million at current prices. The wallet’s tokens holdings also remain significant, sitting at $1.115 million at the time of this writing. The recent transactions have now dredged up speculations about who the BALD deployer might be. On-chain investigator ZachXBT previously lent his expertise to the investigations, with findings pointing toward an X (formerly Twitter) user who goes by the username @milkyway16eth due to a previous transaction between the deployer wallet and Milkyway’s wallet. However, there is yet to be any concrete proof if Milkyway is actually the brains behind the rug. A Rollercoaster For Investors The BALD meme coin started making the rounds on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after being launched on Base. The coin which was named after Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong’s bald head rose rapidly, climbing more than 289,000% in less than two days. This growth rate served as an attraction for investors, who bridged quickly to the ETH blockchain to invest in the token. It continued to rise, crossing a $70 million market amid the euphoria. However, this would end up being short-lived. Related Reading: More Selling? Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase On August 1, the BALD deployer pulled liquidity from the token, making off with 10,705 ETH ($20 million at the time). The coin’s price declined rapidly after this, although the official X account for BALD continued to deny that it was a rug pull. Although BALD continues to trade on the Base network, it has been unable to reclaim its past glory. Its price is down over 90% from its all-time high and recorded 18% losses in the last 24 hours alone, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Its daily trading volume is sitting at $503,000 and its market cap is $9.03 million.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows large Maker holders have accumulated recently, a sign that the rally could extend soon. Maker Large Holders Have Continued To Expand Their Holdings Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, inflows to the wallets of the large MKR investors have been taking place for a while now. The &#8220;large holders&#8221; here refer to those investors who hold at least 0.1% of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s circulating supply. In Maker&#8217;s case, this value would equal about $1.2 million. Thus, the only holders who would clear these criteria would be the sharks and whales, the largest entities on the network. These investors generally hold some influence in the market, as they can move many tokens at once. Thus, the behavior of this cohort could be worth watching, as it may reveal answers about where the asset might be heading next. One way to track the behavior of these humongous holders is through the &#8220;netflow&#8221; metric, which measures the net amount of MKR that these large investors are adding into or moving out of their combined holdings right now. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that a net number of coins is entering into the supply of these investors currently, suggesting that they are participating in buying. On the other hand, negative values could imply that this group may be selling as its members are transferring a net amount of the asset away from their wallets.

There were a few dips into the negative territory, but the net outflows weren&#8217;t significant in scale then. In the past few weeks, there haven&#8217;t been any drops below the zero mark, suggesting that the large holders have only continued accumulating more MKR recently. Something to note here is that a positive netflow doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t any selling taking place at all. Instead, it simply suggests that the accumulation is enough to cancel any distribution. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin?

This conviction from these large holders can naturally be a positive sign for Maker, as the asset could potentially continue its rally soon.

					<description><![CDATA[Michael Burry, renowned investor, and hedge fund manager, has once again made headlines with his significant short position in the traditional market, which could impact the nascent crypto industry if his bet is to materialize. Burry, known for accurately predicting the subprime mortgage crisis, recently went mega-short with over $1.6 billion in S&#38;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) puts. These indexes often record a high correlation with the crypto market as they attract similar investors.  Burry&#8217;s $1.6 Billion Short Signals Potential Implications For Crypto Market Burry&#8217;s track record as an astute investor lends weight to his latest bet. By predicting and profiting from the subprime mortgage crisis, he gained a reputation as an investor capable of identifying market trends before they unfold.  It is important to consider that Burry has established himself as a prognosticator who is often ahead of the curve and is willing to wait for the anticipated market changes to come to fruition.

On this matter, Yan Alleman, co-founder of Glassnode, has supported Burry&#8217;s approach, suggesting that while the short-term effects may not be immediately evident, the long-term payoff is likely to be significant. Alleman also highlighted the potential impact of the US Dollar Index (DXY) on the cryptocurrency market, specifically Bitcoin. According to Alleman, the recent renewed strength of the DXY could exert pressure on Bitcoin. The DXY measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies.  On The Verge Of A Final Leg Up? As Burry predicts, a drop in the DXY could result in a significant surge in crypto assets, including Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. This surge would represent a final leg up before a presumed deep correction across financial markets. While the correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin has been subject to debate, the potential consequences of Burry&#8217;s short position on the market cannot be ignored.  If his prediction were to come true, it could trigger a domino effect, leading to a substantial downturn in traditional markets and a subsequent surge in crypto assets. Nevertheless, the implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in such a scenario are twofold. On the one hand, Bitcoin has often been hailed as a digital store of value and a hedge against traditional market downturns.  Burry&#8217;s short position on the market could reinforce this narrative, attracting more investors to Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s extreme volatility could magnify the potential crypto bloodbath if Burry&#8217;s bet materialized.  A sudden surge in selling pressure for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, coupled with a widespread market correction, could result in a sharp decline in the crypto market, causing substantial losses for investors who entered the market at its peak.

As of the current writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,300, indicating a marginal 0.3% decline over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has continued to be in a consolidation phase since the start of August. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
