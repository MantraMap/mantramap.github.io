This is seen as proof that "we've found the bottom" - many investors were standing by, waiting to see what the bottom would be - now that they have an answer, expect more to take positions as prices remain low.<br /><br />Others believe that these gains are only temporary. They point to the general economic uncertainty that can be found in most industries, in most countries - and top concern, inflation, far from resolved.</p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Make Smart Moves:&nbsp;</b></span></p><p>There's 2 strategies dominating in communities of experienced traders. <br /><br />Those who agree$16,000 is indeed 'bottom' will likely agree with the strategy shared by one trader&nbsp;<i>"Anything within $10k of that is an automatic buy - so if the price is $26,000 or less I'm accumulating."</i><br /><br />If you're not convinced that we've seen the worst of it, you'll probably agree with what another trader shared, saying&nbsp;<i>"I still believe a drop to $10-12k is possible before the next real, sustained bull run.&nbsp; So I'm&nbsp;going to keep my DCA strategy running"</i> - DCA stands for Dollar Cost Averaging, this method involves investing a set amount each week no matter what the price is. If it goes down from here, you still have funds to buy the dip.&nbsp; If the price continues to go up, you at least bought some near the recent low.<br /><br /><i><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Share your thoughts: </span></b><br />Do you believe recent gains will hold?
