<h2>ECB’s Christine Lagarde on De-Dollarization and Alternative Currencies</h2>
<p>The president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, shared her thoughts on the de-dollarization trend happening across the globe in an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations last week.</p>
<p>Noting that the U.S. dollar has become “the international, the global reserve, and the transaction currency” with the euro in second place, she warned that “new trade patterns may have ramifications for payments and international currency reserves.” The ECB president continued: “In recent decades, China has already increased over 130-fold its bilateral trade in goods with emerging markets and developing economies, with the country also becoming the world’s top exporter … New trade patterns may also lead to new alliances.”</p>
<p>Lagarde added, “Recent research indicates that there is a significant correlation between a country’s trade with China and its holding in renminbi as reserves.&#8221; Noting that “One study finds that alliances can increase the share of a currency in the partner’s reserve holdings by roughly 30 percentage points,” the ECB chief cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>All this could create opportunities for certain countries seeking to reduce their dependency on our Western payment system and currency frameworks.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, Lagarde emphasized: “These developments do not point to an imminent loss of dominance for the U.S. dollar or for the euro … So, so far the data do not show substantial changes in the use of international currencies.” Nonetheless, she admitted that data do suggest:</p>
<blockquote><p>International currency status should no longer be taken for granted, and that we should be really attentive to the currency in which trade transactions are organized.</p></blockquote>
<p>A growing number of countries are using local currencies for trade settlements instead of the U.S. dollar. In addition, the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are reportedly creating a new type of currency that will further reduce their dependence on the USD.</p>

<h2>Hillary Clinton on U.S. Debt Default and Dollar Losing World’s Reserve Currency Status</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton, a former first lady and the U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, warned in an opinion piece, published by the New York Times Monday, about the disastrous outcomes that could result from the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations, including the risk of the dollar losing its status as the world&#8217;s reserve currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The debt ceiling debate is not about authorizing new spending. It’s about Congress paying debts it has already incurred. Refusing to pay would be like skipping out on your mortgage, except with global consequences,&#8221; Clinton described, warning:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because of the central role of the United States — and the dollar — in the international economy, defaulting on our debts could spark a worldwide financial meltdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting that “the competition between democracies and autocracies has grown more intense,” the former first lady cautioned: “By undermining America’s credibility and the pre-eminence of the dollar, the fight over the debt ceiling plays right into the hands of Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.”</p>
<p>Clinton opined: “Playing games with the debt ceiling imperils the dollar’s pre-eminent position in the global economy and the power that gives the United States.”</p>

<p>The former secretary of state detailed that the USD is central to international transactions conducted by people, companies, and governments worldwide. They invest in U.S. Treasury bonds and rely on U.S. banks “because they trust that America pays its debts, upholds the rule of law and guarantees stability,” she asserted, adding that it has allowed the U.S. to impose sanctions, such as those against Iran and Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s no surprise that Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin are eager to disrupt the dollar’s dominance and defang American sanctions,&#8221; Clinton said, concluding:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Congress keeps flirting with default, calls for dethroning the dollar as the world’s reserve currency will grow much louder — and not just in Beijing and Moscow. Countries all over the world will start hedging their bets.</p></blockquote>
<p>A growing number of countries are already ramping up efforts to shift away from using U.S. dollars in trade settlements, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/asean-countries-take-steps-to-reduce-reliance-on-us-dollar-for-trade-settlements/">ASEAN countries</a>. Meanwhile, the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are reportedly creating a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">new currency</a> that will reduce their reliance on the USD.</p>

He further stressed: “All the bad stuff that they’re saying is going to happen if we don’t raise the debt ceiling is guaranteed to happen because we do raise the debt ceiling.”</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Schiff on U.S. Debt Default</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff warned Monday on the Peter Schiff Show podcast that the United States will default on its debt obligations and that raising the debt ceiling will have devastating consequences.</p>
<p>Commenting on politicians claiming that the U.S. debt ceiling must be raised &#8220;because we pay our bills,” the economist argued: “We never pay our bills … We have $31.7 trillion in debt. That’s $31.7 trillion of bills that we have not paid. We didn’t pay them. We borrowed the money. And we want to keep on borrowing the money. Nobody wants to pay any of these bills.” Schiff cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s only a question of time. It’s not a question of if. It’s just a question of when. We will default on our debt. All the bad stuff that they’re saying is going to happen if we don’t raise the debt ceiling is guaranteed to happen because we do raise the debt ceiling.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that eventually, the borrowing and money printing by the Federal Reserve will precipitate a financial and currency crisis. “It’s not about America not wanting to borrow. It’s about the rest of the world not wanting to lend because they know we’re not going to pay them back. And one of the reasons they know that is because we’ve already told them. We are telling them that repeatedly in the debt ceiling battle,” he opined.</p>
<p>The economist detailed that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations in two forms. The first is “an honest default where the government just doesn’t pay back bondholders&#8221; and the second is “a dishonest default where we pay with inflation.” In the latter case, he stressed that the Federal Reserve will just “print money and pay people back with worthless or near-worthless paper.”</p>

<p>Regarding commentary in the media framing the debt ceiling as the problem, Schiff argued that the problem is actually the debt. He cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is that Congress and the president keep running up more and more debt and every time we get to the ceiling, we either raise it or suspend it … The problem is that we keep raising the ceiling, not that we won’t raise it. In fact, the threat is that we raise it again.</p></blockquote>

<h2>De-Dollarization Happening Faster Than People Realize, Says Economist</h2>
<p>Economist Peter St Onge warned about the dire consequences of weaponizing the U.S. dollar in a video he posted on Twitter Monday. St Onge is a Research Fellow and the Mark A. Kolokotrones Fellow in Economic Freedom at the Heritage Foundation. Before joining the Heritage Foundation, he was a Fellow at the Mises Institute, a Senior Fellow at the Montreal Economic Institute, and an Assistant Professor of International Trade and of Marketing at Taiwan’s Feng Chia University.</p>
<p>Citing a former Morgan Stanley analyst, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/strategists-us-dollars-reserve-currency-status-eroding-at-alarming-pace/">Stephen Jen</a>, stating that the U.S. dollar has already suffered a “stunning collapse” and is losing its reserve currency status at an “alarming pace,” St Onge stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>De-dollarization is happening faster than people realize.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The dollar share went from 73% in 2001 to 55% in 2021, at which point it fell off a cliff, losing market share 10 times faster,” the economist detailed. “The dollar plunged 8 percentage points in share in a single year to just 47% so we lost about double the entire share of the Chinese yuan. And at that pace, the U.S. dollar would be eclipsed in about 6 years.”</p>
<p>He added: “Separate data from central banks around the world confirm that after decades of complacency, the landscape is shifting.”</p>
<h2>Effects of Sanctions on USD</h2>
<p>St Onge went on to explain that what severely affected the USD in 2022 was sanctions. He noted that last year, the U.S. froze approximately $300 billion in Russian central bank assets.</p>
<p>“These were Russia&#8217;s sovereign dollars. They and everybody else in the world thought of them like gold. This was something we hadn&#8217;t even done during the Cold War — during the height of the Cold War with hot proxy wars all over the world — because we were run by adults. Why did Biden do it? The goal was to cause bank panics and crash the Russian economy — perhaps to set off mass unemployment and civil unrest. Of course, it backfired, instead, sending countries around the world in panicked flight from the dollar … and so overnight, the U.S. dollar went from the world&#8217;s rock-solid store of value to a political football held hostage to whichever lobbyist or activist caught Joe Biden&#8217;s eye this week,” he opined.</p>
<p>The economist concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the U.S. dollar does continue on this path, we will see soaring inflation, a catastrophic fallen American standard of living, and a U.S. that falls off the world stage — not by choice but by necessity — all of it, 100% our own making.</p></blockquote>

<p>Numerous individuals have expressed similar warnings. A growing number of countries are also ramping up efforts to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iranian-professor-saudi-arabia-may-join-de-dollarization-shift-as-us-dollar-is-now-unreliable-and-dangerous/">shift away</a> from using the U.S. dollar in trade settlements. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/syrian-official-says-us-imposes-sanctions-to-steal-nations-assets-and-exert-control/">Syrian foreign minister</a> said last week that the U.S. imposes sanctions to steal targeted nations&#8217; assets and keep them under its hegemony.</p>
<p>Commenting on St Onge’s video, Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you weaponize currency enough times, other countries will stop using it.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Voyager&#8217;s Asset Purchase Agreement With Binance US Scrapped</h2>
<p>Towards the end of 2022, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-plans-to-acquire-voyager-digitals-assets-for-1-billion-in-bankruptcy-bid/">disclosed</a> that its US subsidiary had entered into a billion-dollar agreement with Voyager Digital Ltd. to acquire its assets. Despite <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-intervenes-in-binance-us-acquisition-of-bankrupt-crypto-lender-voyager-digitals-assets/">objections</a> from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the purchase was allowed to proceed after receiving <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-sec-objection-court-greenlights-billion-dollar-asset-purchase-deal-between-binance-us-and-voyager/">court approval</a>. However, on April 25, 2023, Voyager revealed that the deal was no longer moving forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we received a letter from Binance US terminating the asset purchase agreement. While this development is disappointing, our Chapter 11 plan allows for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers (a “toggle option”) via the Voyager platform,&#8221; Voyager <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917?s=20">announced</a> via Twitter.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS">https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS</a> has made the difficult decision to exercise its right to terminate the asset purchase agreement with Voyager. </p>
<p>While our hope throughout this process was to help Voyager&#39;s customers access their crypto in kind, the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Nine months prior, the TSX-listed Voyager Digital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tsx-listed-voyager-digital-temporarily-suspends-trading-deposits-and-withdrawals/">halted withdrawals</a> on July 1, 2022, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/voyager-files-for-bankruptcy-citing-contagion-in-crypto-markets-three-arrows-capitals-loan-default/">filed for bankruptcy</a> six days later. The firm cited &#8220;prolonged volatility and contagion in the crypto markets&#8221; as the reasons behind its failure. Before Binance stepped in to offer assistance, FTX was supposed to have helped Voyager, but Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire had collapsed.</p>

<p>The official Twitter account of Voyager&#8217;s Committee of Unsecured Creditors also expressed disappointment upon learning of the termination of the deal with Binance. &#8220;Around 2 hours ago, Binance US purported to terminate the asset purchase agreement with Voyager,&#8221; the account <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1650923721559777288?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#8220;The Committee is incredibly disappointed with this decision and is investigating potential claims against Binance US.&#8221;</p>

The intervention aimed to furnish U.S. dollar liquidity, with the intention of alleviating the impact of such severe shocks on the flow of credit to households and businesses. As per the joint statement published on Tuesday, the central banks have decided to curtail these newly introduced swap line arrangements, switching them from daily auctions to weekly operations.</strong></p>
<h2>Central Banks Cut Back USD Liquidity Backstop; Moody&#8217;s Downgrades U.S. Banking Sector and 11 Regional Banks</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2023/april/us-dollar-liquidity-providing-operations-from-1-may-2023">joint statement</a> from several central banks, including the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Swiss National Bank, and the U.S. Federal Reserve, the recently created U.S. dollar swap line arrangements will be reduced from daily to weekly.</p>
<p>The announcement cites &#8220;improvements in U.S. dollar funding conditions and low demand at recent 7-day maturity&#8221; as the reason for the auction cuts. However, the central banks say that the &#8220;liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets&#8221; could adjust the operations rate provision depending on &#8220;market conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The original coordinated emergency response <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/several-major-central-banks-take-coordinated-action-to-boost-liquidity-amidst-banking-crisis/">announcement</a> was made 37 days ago on March 19, 2023. The decision was made after the fall of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and Signature Bank. The demise of SVB&#8217;s UK branch and the fall of Credit Suisse followed with the Swiss National Bank urging UBS to acquire Credit Suisse. While the central banks cite U.S. dollar funding conditions improving, the world&#8217;s leading credit rating agency, Moody&#8217;s Investor Service, downgraded the U.S. banking sector five days ago.</p>
<p>“There are negative credit implications for the U.S. banking sector that extend beyond immediate funding challenges to downward pressure on banks’ earnings, combined in some cases with weaker capitalization and risks related to commercial real estate (CRE),” Moody’s <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/moodys-downgrades-u-s-banks-to-strong-from-very-strong-as-credit-strength-ebbs-fb9d0ac3">disclosed</a> on Friday.</p>
<h2>Western Alliance CEO: The Waters Are Now Calmer</h2>
<p>Amid the U.S. banking sector downgrade, the credit rating agency that evaluates and assigns a credit rating to each bank also downgraded 11 U.S. banks, including First Republic Bank, U.S. Bancorp, Comerica Inc., Zions Bancorporation, and Western Alliance Bancorp.</p>

<p>In a statement issued on behalf of Zions Bancorporation to the Wall Street Journal, the recent assessment provided by Moody&#8217;s was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/moodys-downgrades-11-regional-banks-including-zions-u-s-bank-western-alliance-174e4d7f">contested</a>. Disagreeing with the agency&#8217;s conclusions, James Abbott, the bank&#8217;s director of investor relations, expressed disappointment that Moody&#8217;s had overlooked the &#8220;tremendous value&#8221; inherent in Zions&#8217; inexpensive deposit foundation.</p>

<p>Several market observers believe that the banking crisis is ongoing, with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-says-banking-crisis-not-over-warns-of-repercussions-for-years-to-come/">stating</a> in early April that it is not over. Economist and gold investor Peter Schiff has also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-says-banking-crisis-not-over-much-worse-financial-crisis-incoming-warns-of-massive-recession/">warned</a> of a significant recession this month, indicating that the banking issues are far from resolved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lynette Zang, the chief market analyst at ITM Trading, recently <a href="https://youtu.be/PZyc13m_ymU">told</a> Kitco News in an interview that a banking fallout could trigger the onset of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), suggesting that there may be more to come. However, Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regional-banks-arent-collapsing-that-doesnt-mean-everything-is-fine-114526313.html">believes</a> that the banking crisis is &#8220;largely contained,&#8221; while Western Alliance CEO Ken Vecchione noted that &#8220;the waters are now calmer.&#8221; On Tuesday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, First Republic Bank’s (NYSE: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-FRC/">FRC</a>) shares slid more than 40%.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on the joint decision by several central banks to reduce U.S. dollar swap line arrangements from daily to weekly auctions, and Moody&#8217;s recent downgrade of the U.S. banking sector and 11 regional banks? Do you believe the banking crisis is far from over, or do you think the waters are now calmer, as some experts suggest? Share your views in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Along with nine others, Shin is suspected of deceiving investors and accumulating around 460 billion won ($350M) before the Terra project ultimately failed.</strong></p>
<h2>Daniel Shin Indicted With 9 Other Terra Associates</h2>
<p>KBS World, a regional South Korean publication, has <a href="http://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?Seq_Code=177381&amp;lang=e">revealed</a> that ten individuals, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korean-court-denies-arrest-warrant-for-terraform-co-founder-daniel-shin/">Daniel Shin</a>, have been indicted in South Korea. Although they have not been detained, the suspects have been charged with financial law violations, embezzlement, and fraud. The South Korean authorities suspect that this group of individuals raised 460 billion won ($350M) through unlawful means linked to the Terra blockchain project.</p>
<p>According to the KBS report, Shin was responsible for supervising terrausd (UST) (now known as USTC) payments for four years, starting from July 2018. Prosecutors have reason to believe that false advertising was utilized during this period. Seven of the ten suspects who were indicted worked for Terraform Labs, while one was Shin&#8217;s financial broker. Although the prosecution is aiming to seize 246.8 billion won ($184.7M), the process has been far from smooth.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korean-court-rules-terra-crypto-asset-lunc-is-not-a-security/">recent ruling</a>, the court in Seoul stated that the original Terra asset, now referred to as LUNC, is not a security. As a result, the Seoul prosecutors&#8217; office had difficulty confiscating Daniel Shin&#8217;s cryptocurrency assets due to this provision. After eleven months of investigations, the Seoul prosecutors&#8217; office is now bringing the accused to trial. Notably, the indictment report does not mention co-founder Kwon Do-hyeong, commonly known as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-challenges-secs-jurisdiction-in-multibillion-dollar-crypto-securities-fraud-case/">Do Kwon</a>.</p>

Four of the top five stablecoins experienced net redemptions over the last 30 days, except for tether, which grew by 2.3% during that time.</strong></p>
<h2>Four of the Top Five Stablecoins Experience Net Redemptions in the Past 30 Days</h2>
<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230329184118/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">March 31, 2023</a>, the top stablecoins by market capitalization represented $133.63 billion in value, and now the valuation is down to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">$131.21 billion</a>. A total of $2.4 billion worth of stablecoins has been withdrawn from the stablecoin economy since then. Data reveals that over the past 30 days, USDC, BUSD, DAI, and TUSD have all seen redemptions. Usd coin&#x2019;s (USDC) circulating supply dropped 10.2% compared to last month, and binance usd (BUSD) fell by 20.6%. Of the top five largest stablecoins, both USDC and BUSD experienced the most redemptions.</p>

<p>Further, DAI&#x2019;s circulating supply slipped 9% lower in 30 days and TUSD&#x2019;s supply decreased by 0.7%. Tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>), however, grew 2.3% since last month, reaching a market capitalization worth $81.39 billion. Tether&#x2019;s market valuation accounts for 61.65% of the entire stablecoin economy&#x2019;s $131.21 billion value. While tether&#x2019;s supply grew by 2.3%, pax dollar (USDP) rose by 33.9% since last month.</p>

<p>USDP now has a market valuation of approximately $1,037,832,268. Both frax dollar and Tron&#x2019;s USDD experienced losses during the past 30 days; frax dollar (FRAX) shed 3.8% while USDD lost 1% of its circulating supply. Gemini&#x2019;s dollar-pegged token GUSD saw its supply increase by 18.1% to $465.22 million. Liquity usd (LUSD) recorded a 2.4% rise, and magic internet money (MIM) increased by 5.9% last month. The entire stablecoin economy represents 11.02% of the crypto economy&#x2019;s $1.19 trillion net value.</p>

The price plunged as consumer confidence in the United States fell by more than expected, coming in at a reading of 101.3 in April. Solana also slipped, hitting a two-week low.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) dropped to a six-week low on Tuesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained bearish.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD dropped for a third straight session, hitting an intraday low of $0.9633 in the process.</p>
<p>The move came less than a day after polygon was trading at a peak of $1.01, with today’s fall sending it to its weakest point since March 10.</p>

<p>As a result of the sell-off, it appears that MATIC bears are targeting a floor at the $0.95 mark.</p>
<p>From the chart, one of the catalysts for the drop seems to be a breakout that occurred on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>The index fell below a floor at 32.00, and is currently tracking at 31.13, which is its lowest reading since last June.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) was another notable mover on Tuesday, as the token moved closer to a floor at $20.00.</p>
<p>Following a high of $21.95 to start the week, SOL/USD dropped to a low of $20.92 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>Today’s slippage sent solana to its lowest level since April 11, when price fell to a bottom at $20.83.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, SOL has somewhat risen from its earlier low, and is currently trading at $20.95.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the RSI indicator continues to track near a floor at 42.00, with a present reading of 42.66.</p>
<p>Should it fall below this point of support, it is highly likely that solana will drop below $20.00.</p>

The milestone marks a significant accomplishment in Venom’s roadmap as it prepares to launch on mainnet. Along with the testnet launch, Venom has also unveiled a host of in-house developed decentralized applications as part of its growing ecosystem.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The testnet design suits both ecosystem users and developers. It enables developers to test and debug dApps and blockchain protocols, while allowing users to experience these dApps firsthand. The goal of the program is to encourage innovation and community building within the ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers and users can try out the testnet in two simple steps. First, download the Venom Wallet on mobile via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, or on the desktop as a Google Chrome extension. Secondly, users can jumpstart their journey of testing the Venom ecosystem by claiming a free testnet allocation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to announce the launch of Venom&#8217;s public testnet, a crucial step towards our upcoming mainnet launch. With our highly scalable and reliable asynchronous blockchain, we&#8217;re confident that developers will be able to build innovative dApps, while users will be able to experience them firsthand,&#8221; said Peter Knez, Chair of the Venom Foundation Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers will be able to try their hand at building on the asynchronous Venom blockchain which boasts ultra-fast speed at 100k TPS, and a dynamic sharding feature that enhances scalability and network reliability. To kick things off, Venom has curated a repository of developer documentation to equip developers with the necessary tools and knowledge to start building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venom’s network boosts interoperability making it a viable tool for developers, while its low transaction fees makes it user-friendly for global adoption. </span></p>
<p><b>A host of dApps debut on the testnet</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several dApps are to make their debut on Venom testnet. Users can test them out by performing transactions, testing the native Venom wallet and much more. </span></p>
