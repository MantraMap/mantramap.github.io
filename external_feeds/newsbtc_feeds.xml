					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price failed to clear the $17,300 zone and corrected lower. BTC could find a strong buying interest near $16,900 or $16,700 in the coming sessions. Bitcoin failed to gain pace for a move above $17,300 and $17,450. The price is trading below $17,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $17,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could bounce back if it stays above the $16,900 and $16,700 support levels. Bitcoin Price Remains Supported Bitcoin price was able to clear the $17,000 resistance zone. However, the price failed to gain pace for a move above $17,300 and $17,450. A high was formed near $17,292 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a clear move below the $17,100 and $17,000 levels. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,700 swing low to $17,292 high. Bitcoin price is now trading below $17,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $17,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is now approaching the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,700 swing low to $17,292 high. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $17,150 zone and the trend line, above which the price may perhaps start a fresh increase. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price could rise towards the $17,300 resistance. The next major resistance is near $17,450, above which the price rise towards the $18,000 zone in the near term. Downside Break in BTC? If bitcoin fails to clear the $17,150 resistance, there could be more losses. An immediate support on the downside is near the $16,900 level. The next major support is near the $16,700 zone or the last swing low. A downside break below the $16,700 support might call a drop towards $16,500. Any more losses might push the price towards the $16,200 zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now in the oversold zone. Major Support Levels – $16,900, followed by $16,700. Major Resistance Levels – $17,050, $17,150 and $17,450.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cosmin Mesenschi is the Founder and CEO of FirstByte Media. A brand creator with a wealth of knowledge in the crypto gambling industry. His past experiences in the sector have shaped his way of thinking about the market, leading him to find a niche where he could match his own interests with the market&#8217;s needs. Recently, we asked him a few questions about CryptoGamble.tips and the benefits it offers. Q: Let&#8217;s start with FirstByte Media. Can you refresh our readers&#8217; memory by explaining what exactly your company does? FirstByte Media is composed of Brand Creators. Therefore, we create brands that serve users in search of valuable information. By doing so, we are incorporating the knowledge of the crypto and igaming industry we have accumulated over time. Q: Tell us about all the platforms operated by FirstByte Media FirstByte Media has three leading brands as of this moment. Our main one, CryptoGamble, is a crypto casino comparison website that helps players find reliable and accurate information about the crypto casinos and their offers (bonuses, games, etc.) BettingDose, similar in structure, provides information about crypto betting websites. We aim to educate our users about the betting markets and the advantage of crypto betting compared to traditional sports betting. MonsterGames, on the other hand, focuses on a rising trend in the igaming industry, crypto esports betting. On our website, players may find all the valuable information about it and learn what esports betting is all about and how they could use cryptocurrencies to bet on it. And soon more brands will be released, the team is working to develop more suitable projects for our future and current partners. Q: Can you please explain what CryptoGamble.tips is all about? How does it benefit the crypto community? As mentioned above, CryptoGamble is a valuable source of information and news concerning crypto casino recommendations. We poured all of our knowledge into this website and are working on improving it and providing our visitors with the most relevant and up-to-date information which will help them navigate the crypto gaming industry. We do so by reviewing each platform through our analysis process to identify and propose an objective view for all the players looking to make clear information about them. Q: What parameters does your website evaluate before listing any crypto gambling or casino platforms? The community is the main parameter we use in deciding what casinos to list and which not. Most of the new casinos are researched in forums beforehand, and that&#8217;s where we find most of the gambling houses, plus there are others that reach out directly. Lastly, we attend gambling conferences and meet most of the people working for big brands. Q: If I am a crypto gambling platform operator, how do I get my website listed on CryptoGamble.tips? A crypto gambling site can get listed by applying via our &#8220;list your site&#8221; page. Once we get the request, we start our analysis of the platform. Once we determine it&#8217;s a good fit for our audience, we review the casino &#8211; usually, the process takes 2 weeks. The last step is adding it to our 80+ crypto casino reviews directory. Q: Do you have any collaborations with gambling platform operators or game developers? Yes, we do. There are certain brands that we love more than others. However, our collaboration is available only to casinos with a particular rating score. Otherwise, there is no possibility for the casino to be promoted more than others. Meanwhile, as CryptoGamble focuses mainly on crypto casino reviews, collaboration with game developers is only one of our concerns. Still, we are publishing informative pages about them. Q: What makes CryptoGamble.tips different from other casino review and rating platforms that are currently available online? From the beginning, transparency and honesty have been our strongest motivators in overall shaping the website and brand. Keeping that in mind, we have developed a unique, unbiased rating system that can be easily accessible on our website. With the help of said rating system, we determine which crypto casinos are worthy of our visitors&#8217; time and money. To make things even more transparent, we have recently started streaming on several platforms that include Twitch (twitch.tv/theroyalgambler) Youtube, and Dlive, where we test the casinos in our offer with our users. In this way, the visitors and we can experience the crypto casinos firsthand and build a long-lasting and, more importantly, trusting relationship with our community. Q: Can you estimate how many crypto gamers have so far benefited from your offering? From our data since the day we went online (Jan 2020), we helped more than 43k people make better decisions regarding crypto gambling. Q: What are the future plans for CryptoGamble.Tips? Our future plans are to focus on and create a bridge between the casinos from web2.0 to web 3.0. That means recreating the standards of comparison websites for casinos in the crypto space. We will keep our central core of casino reviews and what surrounds them, which include exclusive offers, streaming, slot reviews, game guides, casino tips, and more. Also, as said in a previous article regarding the future of our market, crypto and gambling will keep on growing and we are making sure to be top of mind for future and current users. These are our plans for the future as a company and as a brand. &#160; In another interview on Sigma Cosmin shares his initial thoughts on how he launched and started his journey in the business. We can see that since the first interview he has overcome several challenges that brought him to be an international entrepreneur and speaker at several gaming conferences.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The entire crypto industry has been experiencing a winter since the last quarter of 2021. Some cryptocurrency prices experienced a massive price slump, with many declining over 65%. However bad things may look, crypto may not go extinct as its popularity has not reduced. A recent study by CryptoManiaks, a crypto education platform, shows that Turkey and the Netherlands ranked top in cryptocurrency awareness. As per the survey, 5.5% and 8.2% of the population in Turkey and the Netherlands searched for crypto-related terms. Turkey accounted for 4.7 million searches, topping the chart with large numbers. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Bulls Hold Strong, Indicators Suggest Fresh Rally To $1,400 Turkey has made tremendous improvements in crypto adoption since the beginning of 2022. A 2022 research by the Turkish crypto exchange Paribu estimated that at least 8 million people in Turkey engaged in crypto. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke about the benefits of blockchain innovations. In his statement, Erdogan added that Turkey wants to be a producer of digital assets, not a consumer. DOGE Outranks Ether In Terms Of User-Curiosity In Turkey The latest CryptoManiaks study analyzed the number of searches for some selected cryptocurrencies. They represented the number of cryptocurrencies as a percentage of the population for each country to calculate the monthly local searches. Turkey ranked second in the overall study and first with 812,000 monthly searches related to Dogecoin. According to the survey, the number of searches for Dogecoin doubled that of Ethereum, the third most searched crypto in the country. CryptoManiaks&#8217; spokesperson commented on the rising Dogecoin curiosity over the last 12 months. He said Dogecoin&#8217;s popularity has significantly exceeded Ethereum&#8217;s, with almost 2 million monthly searches worldwide. DOGE became popular after Elon musk revealed plans to make it the official token for Twitter monetization. As a result, the memecoin&#8217;s price soared to an all-time high within the week of the complete official acquisition of the social media platform by Elon Musk. The survey didn&#8217;t feature only DOGE and Ethereum. It also featured Solana, BNB, Bitcoin, and others. After Turkey and the Netherlands, Canada, Germany, and the Czech Republic followed in ranking. Bear Market Didn&#8217;t Cripple People&#8217;s Interest In Crypto Although the United Kingdom and the United States are top global players in the cryptocurrency industry, none ranked in the top. That is because the number of searches is insignificant compared to their population sizes. For example, the United States ranked 15th, with 1.9% of its population searching for crypto-related terms, whereas the United Kingdom took the 12th spot with 2.6%.

Recent research by Cointelegraph also showed that the bear market did not affect the interests of several institutions in the Crypto industry. According to the report, top institutions are still interested in the cryptocurrency industry and continue to invest millions in crypto-related projects.

<h2>Bear Market Didn&#8217;t Cripple People&#8217;s Interest In Crypto</h2>
<p>Although the United Kingdom and the United States are top global players in the cryptocurrency industry, none ranked in the top. That is because the number of searches is insignificant compared to their population sizes. For example, the United States ranked 15th, with 1.9% of its population searching for crypto-related terms, whereas the United Kingdom took the 12th spot with 2.6%.</p>

<p>Recent research by Cointelegraph also showed that the bear market did not affect the interests of several institutions in the Crypto industry. According to the report, top <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2022/innovation/porsche-unveils-entry-into-virtual-worlds-at-art-basel-in-miami-30519.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">institutions</a> are still interested in the cryptocurrency industry and continue to invest millions in crypto-related projects.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amid the crypto winter and the Ripple lawsuit saga, XRP is breaking records with over a 4% price surge in 30 days. Unfortunately, the past 30 days have been terrible in the market after the FTX collapse, which broke down cryptocurrency values. However, the low price period proved very beneficial to some fat wallet holders who seized the opportunity to accumulate more assets. Ripple&#8217;s native token, XRP, recorded more recovery than Bitcoin amid whale accumulations in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Ethereum: On-Chain And Social Metrics Reveal Bulls Vs. Bears Battle – Who’s Winning? WhaleAlert reported that crypto whales moved over 275 million XRP tokens, worth more than $107 million, throughout the past 24 hours. The data also revealed that whales purchased over 113 million XRP, about $44 million, in the past 24 hours. Is XRP Showing Signs Of Dominance Over Bitcoin? Most of the transactions came from the Bitso crypto exchange, with the highest record being XRP tokens worth over $15.3 million. These movements saw a price surge in the XRP token, bringing over a 4% increase. However, Bitcoin trades at the $17,153 level, with a 3% dump in the last 30 days. Around the same time, Ripple&#8217;s general counsel, Stuart Alderoty, announced the filing of their final briefing in the XRP lawsuit. The two-year-long legal tussle between the SEC and Ripple is approaching the summary judgment stage. The crypto industry anticipates the outcome of the court&#8217;s ruling as it would affect the future of XRP and the broader digital assets. If the SEC wins the case, XRP will be seen as a security, and other similar tokens may follow suit. Ripples believe the long-standing battle with the Securities and Exchanges Commission is a fight for the crypto industry. However, Stuart Alderoty affirms that the Securities and Exchanges Commission holds no proof to satisfy its claims that XRP is a security. The attorney believes the defendants have an advantage over the commission in the case. Whales&#8217; Continuous Transfer Of XRP: Hold Or Sell signal? Meanwhile, as the firm faces the watchdog in their lawsuit, whales continue accumulating more tokens. To book more profit as the token price surged, whales transferred over 162 million XRP, worth about $63.1 million, in the past 24 hours. On-chain data revealed that most tokens went to the Bitstamp crypto exchange. The report shows that whales moved another 160 million of the token on Thursday as the Ripple/SEC lawsuit approaches the final round.

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum price has moved in the same direction as the broader market. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum has moved up by 2.5%. On the weekly timeframe, the altcoin has rarely registered any movement. This reflects lateral trading for ETH. In the short term, the altcoin might be registering gains, but as the technicals indicate, the coin can depreciate again before it rallies. Accumulation has been considerably low on the chart. Buying activity must significantly increase if ETH is to break above the $1,300 price mark. Even though ETH remained comfortably above the $1,220 price, buying strength has been weak on the daily chart. Ethereum has to keep trading above the $1,240 and $1,250 price levels for the coin to take a shot at $1,300. The bulls will lose all strength if the Ethereum price moves below the $1,240 mark and closes near $1,230. This price pullback can then further fuel a rally to $1,300.

					<description><![CDATA[A quant has explained why the recent retest of a critical support level by Nasdaq may help Bitcoin reverse its own trend. Nasdaq-100 Has Recently Retested A Critical Support Trendline As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, Nasdaq-100 is currently above a support line that has historically been important. Nasdaq-100 (NDX) is a stock market index that includes 102 equity securities issued by 101 of the largest non-financial companies (based on their market caps) listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Here is a chart that shows how this trendline has acted as a bounce in the index&#8217;s price over the past decade: The value of the asset seems to have touched this line recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the price of NDX has been supported five times by this trendline since the year 2010. In each of these instances, the line has put a check on the decline in the index, and has consequently reversed it back up. Related Reading: Upcoming FOMC Meeting Is The Most Important Ever For Bitcoin – Watch Out For The Dot Plot Recently, the Nasdaq-100 index has once again made a touch of this trendline, and has so far managed to stay above it. The quant notes that this retest could have been the end of the latest downwards trend, and might have also been the point of return of a bullish trend. However, if the trendline is lost instead, it would show the extreme strength of the downtrend, and would suggest that there is more drawdown ahead for the market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bottom In? This On-Chain Condition Hasn’t Been Met Yet At the same time, Bitcoin has also been testing a support line, as the analyst has highlighted in the chart: Looks like BTC is also just above a support trendline right now &#124; Source: CryptoQuant In the past year or so, Bitcoin has shown to be highly correlated with the stock market. The reason behind this correlation has been the rise of institutional investors in the crypto who treat it like a risk asset. The quant believes that if the current support retest in the stock market proves to be successful, then BTC could also be expected to see a reversal of its own due to its correlation with the stocks. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin&#8217;s price floats around $17.2k, up 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 7% in value. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the price of the coin over the last five days. The value of the crypto seems to have observed a sharp surge to $17.2k over the past day &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Maxim Hopman on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com]]></description>

<h2>Nasdaq-100 Has Recently Retested A Critical Support Trendline</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/6393014da60e9b7fa21dbbf7-Bitcoin-Correlation-with-Stock-market-Nasdaq-is-at-a-sensitive-point-above-trend">post</a>, Nasdaq-100 is currently above a support line that has historically been important.</p>

<p>Here is a chart that shows how this trendline has acted as a bounce in the index&#8217;s price over the past decade:</p>

<p>The quant believes that if the current support retest in the stock market proves to be successful, then BTC could also be expected to see a reversal of its own due to its correlation with the stocks.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-regains-strength-17k/">Bitcoin&#8217;s price</a> floats around $17.2k, up 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 7% in value.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The LUNA Classic (LUNC) price has noted a fresh decline in the last 24 hours. In that time frame, the altcoin depreciated by 1%. In the past week, LUNC logged gains worth 2.5%. Much of the weekly gains have been lost due to losses on the daily chart. At the moment, LUNC depicts consolidation beneath its immediate resistance mark. With the FTX collapse, LUNC has been teetering under a bearish influence for quite some time. Over the last month, the coin has lost more than 10% of its market value. On the development front, there is a new update. This is the introduction of the new Alpha package for TerraDart. TerraDart is a Dart SDK that is used for writing applications that would be interacting with the Terra blockchain, which has launched a new package called Alpha. The Alpha package has been available to communicate with the LUNC blockchain within Flutter and Dart environments.

The altcoin just fell from $0.000170 due to intra-day losses. Even with developments in the ecosystem, the LUNC price remains largely unaltered. The rigid price ceiling was at $0.000175, but demand for the coin was too low for bulls to take charge. Once the altcoin topples above the $0.000175 mark, it will be an easy path to the psychological level of $0.00019. On the flip side, with lesser accumulation, LUNC would eye its closest support line of $0.000148. Falling through the $0.000148 mark will bring LUNC to $0.00012. The amount of LUNC traded in the last session was low, indicating bearish strength. Technical Analysis In the past month, the coin displayed a bullish divergence, after which LUNC noted a slight increase in price. Despite that, the bulls could not build on their strength. The Relative Strength Index was near the 40-mark, which meant that the coin was moving toward the oversold zone. Similarly, the LUNC price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which denoted a lack of demand. The reading also indicates that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. In regards to buying strength, capital inflows have also declined due to a lack of investor interest. The Chaikin Money Flow depicts capital inflows and outflows at a given point. The indicator was below the half-line which meant low capital inflows. Related Reading: Ethereum: On-Chain And Social Metrics Reveal Bulls Vs. Bears Battle – Who’s Winning? The Directional Movement Index indicates the general price direction and trend of the asset. DMI was negative as the -DI (orange) line was above the +DI (blue) line. The Average Directional Index (red) was below the 25 mark, indicating a loss of strength in the current price action. Presently, LUNC is trading at 100% lower than its all-time high secured approximately eight months ago. Featured image from Wccftech, Chart: TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin whales have continued to shave off their holdings in recent weeks, suggesting that the current lows may not be attractive enough to them. Bitcoin Whales Continue To Sell Despite The Recent Deep Lows As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the number of investors with balances in the 1k to 10k BTC range have continued to decline recently. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;UTXO Count &#8211; Value Bands,&#8221; which tells us about the number of UTXOs (or wallets) that are currently in each Bitcoin value band. These value bands are groups that define ranges between which the balances of UTXOs falling into said bands lie. For example, the 100-1k BTC value band includes all UTXOs (or wallets) that currently have between 100 and 1,000 coins. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales And Sharks Continue To Add To Their Holdings The value band of interest in the current context is the &#8220;1k-10k BTC&#8221; group. Here is a chart that shows how the UTXO Count of this value band has changed over the last several months: Looks like the value of the metric has taken a hit in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin UTXO Count for the 1k-10k BTC value band has observed some steep decline over the past month. Wallets with such large balances usually belong to the whales. This means that the holdings of these humongous holders have gone down in this period. This entire latest decline has come following the crash caused by crypto exchange&#8217;s FTX collapse, which means whales have sold their coins while the prices have been hitting lows. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bottom In? This On-Chain Condition Hasn’t Been Met Yet Historically, whales have shown accumulation behavior as bear markets have bottomed out. But recently instead of seeing an increase or even sideways movement, the UTXO Count of this whale value band has been strangely decreasing. This trend could be a sign that whales are still not finding the current lows attractive enough to buy more, and that they may rather be selling off their reserves as they expect the bearish winds to continue further. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin&#8217;s price floats around $17.2k, up 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 7% in value.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) has failed to rise above key resistance at $1,300 despite rising around 4% over the past 24 hours. At press time, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $1,289. As the trading volume shows, the bulls and bears have woken up again. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume was $6.4 billion, which is about 31% higher than the previous day. Ethereum On-Chain And Social Metrics Show Uncertainty Analysis company Santiment has conducted an analysis of bullish and bearish signs in on-chain and social data for Ethereum and the result is mixed. A bullish argument is made by Ethereum&#8217;s shark and whale addresses. As Santiment writes, just as with Bitcoin, the ETH millionaire addresses gave up much of their supply while conditions looked poor. Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department However, this circumstance has fundamentally changed recently. A month ago, large ETH addresses started accumulating Ethereum again. Since November 7, Ethereum addresses holding 100 million to 1 million coins have accumulated 1.36% of the total supply and 2.09% more ETH overall (than before). Social volume, on the other hand, looks bearish. As with the majority of all cryptocurrencies, the number of discussions on Ethereum is decreasing, but this seems normal for a bear market. As Santiment notes, this is not necessarily a bad thing when the weak hands leave the market. What is negative, however, is that &#8220;there is so little talk about Ethereum compared to other top assets.&#8221; Related Reading: Upcoming FOMC Meeting Is The Most Important Ever For Bitcoin – Watch Out For The Dot Plot At the same time, this could also turn into a bullish argument if bullish whales can drive the price higher with little resistance, thus significantly affecting the general market sentiment. Currently bearish is also the MVRV (average trading return of addresses). The average return among long-term (365-day) addresses still indicates a &#8220;lot of pain.&#8221; However, based on an emerging long-term uptrend in the MVRV, the metric could also be moving into bullish territory. Extremely bullish is the remaining supply of Ethereum on exchanges. This is at a 4-year low of 12.1% of total supply. Thus, the metric clearly points to a nascent bottom that is forming. Sides Are Still Polarized In contrast, funding rates (perpetual contracts) are neutral. Neither the bulls nor bears can prevail on this metric at the moment. ETH funding rates have been too flat to swing in either direction since the FTX implosion. In terms of realized gains/losses, the bears are clearly winning at the moment, according to Santiment&#8217;s analysis. Given the recent surge in the Ethereum price, there is currently a lot of short-term profit-taking. Ultimately, Santiment summarizes: Overall, Ethereum&#8217;s on-chain and social metrics are about as mixed as the crowd&#8217;s perspective is. [&#8230;]Long-term? [&#8230;] Ethereum is very likely closer to its upcoming 3-year low vs. its 3-year high. But are we at maximal pain? Probably not yet.]]></description>

<h2>Ethereum On-Chain And Social Metrics Show Uncertainty</h2>
<p>Analysis company Santiment has conducted an <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1601028485941600257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> of bullish and bearish signs in on-chain and social data for Ethereum and the result is mixed.</p>
<p>A bullish argument is made by Ethereum&#8217;s shark and whale addresses. As Santiment writes, just as with Bitcoin, the ETH millionaire addresses gave up much of their supply while conditions looked poor.</p>

<p>However, this circumstance has fundamentally changed recently. A month ago, large ETH addresses started <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-addresses-holding-32-eth-or-more-on-the-rise-this-on-chain-data-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accumulating</a> Ethereum again. Since November 7, Ethereum addresses holding 100 million to 1 million coins have accumulated 1.36% of the total supply and 2.09% more ETH overall (than before).</p>
<p>Social <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/chainlink-rally-in-social-activity-hits-ath-of-44173-will-link-price-climb-as-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volume</a>, on the other hand, looks bearish. As with the majority of all cryptocurrencies, the number of discussions on Ethereum is decreasing, but this seems normal for a bear market.</p>
<p>As Santiment notes, this is not necessarily a bad thing when the weak hands leave the market. What is negative, however, is that &#8220;there is so little talk about Ethereum compared to other top assets.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time, this could also turn into a bullish argument if bullish whales can drive the price higher with little resistance, thus significantly affecting the general market sentiment.</p>
<p>Currently bearish is also the MVRV (average trading return of addresses). The average return among long-term (365-day) addresses still indicates a &#8220;lot of pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, based on an emerging long-term uptrend in the MVRV, the metric could also be moving into bullish territory.</p>
<p>Extremely bullish is the remaining supply of Ethereum on exchanges. This is at a 4-year low of 12.1% of total supply. Thus, the metric clearly points to a nascent bottom that is forming.</p>
<h2>Sides Are Still Polarized</h2>
<p>In contrast, funding rates (perpetual contracts) are neutral. Neither the bulls nor bears can prevail on this metric at the moment. ETH funding rates have been too flat to swing in either direction since the FTX implosion.</p>
<p>In terms of realized gains/losses, the bears are clearly winning at the moment, according to Santiment&#8217;s analysis. Given the recent surge in the Ethereum price, there is currently a lot of short-term profit-taking.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Santiment summarizes:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Overall, Ethereum&#8217;s on-chain and social metrics are about as mixed as the crowd&#8217;s perspective is. [&#8230;]Long-term? [&#8230;] Ethereum is very likely closer to its upcoming 3-year low vs. its 3-year high. But are we at maximal pain? Probably not yet.</strong></p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Yearn Finance (YFI) has performed relatively well over the last 30 days, painting its charts in green despite the lingering uncertainty in the crypto market. According to information from Coingecko, at press time, the ERC20 governance token built on the Ethereum blockchain is changing hands at $7,087, going up by 5.7% during the past week and tallying an impressive 15.7% jump on its bi-weekly gauge. Here&#8217;s a quick glance of YFI performance: YFI is experiencing a significant decline in its daily trading volume Yearn Finance could fall all the way down to $6K within the next few days The altcoin could start 2023 with a bullish run to reclaim the $8K territory However, the altcoin’s technical indicators, specifically its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), on its 4-hour chart doesn’t give much for traders to desire as they indicate a potential bearish run for the asset. The RSI settled below the 50-neutral zone at 48.97, suggesting that selling pressure increased and a lot of buyers veered away from the asset. Meanwhile, Yearn Finance’s CMF fell into a negative value of -0.07 – an indication of a weakened buying activity.

According to latest data, at the moment, only 59 new addresses were present at the network – 48% lower than what was observed within the last eight days.
