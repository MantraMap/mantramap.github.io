<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Labs has announced plans to introduce Layer 2 (L2) interoperability for its ENS domains during a community call on June 28.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The implementation aims to improve performance, scalability, and cost efficiency for users managing their ENS domains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The decentralized domain name system is set to implement off-chain resolvers, leveraging an ENS off-chain registrar contract and the services of Coinbase&rsquo; cb.id, Lens Protocol, and OptiNames on the Optimism network. This step comes as the L2 ecosystem continues to witness an influx of projects and protocols.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to L2Beat data, the total value of assets locked on L2 service providers has surged by over 190% in the past year, standing at $9.78 billion at the time of writing. Arbitrum leads the market with a 60% share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">ENS domain name registrations experienced robust growth in Q2 2021. Dune Analytics data shows monthly ENS domain name registrations totalling 79,463 last quarter. June, marked by a significant drop in gas fees on the Ethereum Network, recorded the highest number of registrations during the quarter with 35,932 ENS name registrations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While .eth name registrations ended Q2 with a surge, primary ENS name registrations saw a notable decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform. Moreover, ENS registered a cumulative profit of $4.8 million between April 1 and June 30, despite a 21% dip in revenue during this period. ENS&rsquo; annualized revenue has fallen by 5.11%, as per Token Terminal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The daily price performance chart of ENS showed an increase in ENS token accumulation since mid-June, along with a corresponding 22% value growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were on an upward trajectory, indicating a bullish run.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the user-friendliness of the Ethereum network by replacing complex blockchain addresses with easy-to-remember names. With the latest move of introducing Layer 2 interoperability, ENS Labs takes a significant stride towards improving the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of managing ENS domains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This development arrives amidst a growing trend of Layer 2 adoption across the blockchain sphere, an effort to counteract the scalability and performance bottlenecks often associated with the Ethereum mainnet. By enabling Layer 2 solutions, ENS is not only keeping pace with industry trends but also reaffirming its commitment to user experience and network efficiency.</p>
