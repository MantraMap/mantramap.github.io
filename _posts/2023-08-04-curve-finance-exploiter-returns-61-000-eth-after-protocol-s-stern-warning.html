Here’s What On-Chain Data Says The attack on Curve Finance, which took place on July 30th, significantly impacted the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and raised concerns about its security.  The hack targeted several pools on Curve Finance, withdrawing more than $47 million from various DeFi projects.

Following the attack, Curve Finance has taken measures to improve its security, including updating its contracts and implementing stricter security protocols. The protocol has also called on the hacker to return the stolen funds and offered a reward for their cooperation. The hack had caused significant concern among the cryptocurrency community. Still, the Alchemix Finance team&#8217;s swift response and the hacker&#8217;s decision to return the stolen funds demonstrate the importance of protocols taking swift action to protect their users and assets.
