<p>Bitget &mdash; the largest global copy trading platform, ranked 8th on Coingecko by trading volume, is pledging up to $10 million to the development of the Fetch.ai blockchain-based artificial intelligence and machine-learning platform after signing a partnership agreement. The statement highlights that the funds will be directed at the future growth of the promising startup, with options for listing of promising projects launched within its ecosystem on the native Bitget Launchpad.</p>
<p>The blockchain sector is becoming the next arena for the deployment of AI-based solutions, which have stormed the global digital industry with the successful launch of OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT model. Among the leading companies in the blockchain space developing such neural network solutions is the Fetch.ai startup &ndash; an ecosystem comprising a number of modules leveraging decentralized AI agents.</p>
<p>The services Fetch.ai offers include AI-facilitated trading tools, decentralized machine-learning software, and an automated smart wallet supporting GPT model API integration. Other solutions provided within the Fetch.ai ecosystem include CLI tools, indexer services, and a client library, allowing it to act as an off-chain bridge for traditional layer 1 blockchain networks for facilitating P2P interactions in a decentralized environment.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership with Bitget and the $10 million pledge come as the exchange launched a fund dedicated to supporting promising startups that foster a positive approach towards blockchain on the part of global users. The Bitget team will be providing consultations on marketing to Fetch.ai in an effort to ensure higher exposure before potential partners. Projects deploying on the Fetch.ai infrastructure will also be eligible for listing on the Bitget Launchpad, with support for sales events and feature showcasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know value when we see it. Fetch.ai already consists of a host of functioning and applicable technological AI solutions that can have a real impact on the way businesses and individuals interact. That is the main reason we have decided to pledge our support to this promising startup and will continue to do so as we identify others in need of assistance from our dedicated fund. Blockchain progress is unstoppable, but it can be accelerated if we lend it a helping hand, which is what we at Bitget intend to do,&rdquo; as Gracy Chen, the Managing Director of Bitget, commented regarding the announcement of the pledge.</p>

<p>The rising wave of hype surrounding AI-based solutions has permeated blockchain space as well, making such partnerships as the one between Bitget and Fetch.ai essential for maintaining the traction of technological development in the industry and related areas. Bitget is also interested in supporting such initiatives and startups, as it goes in line with its new expansion strategy that has already seen the exchange engage in corporate social responsibility projects with global brands in an effort to promote blockchain adoption and education to attract new audiences of users.</p>
