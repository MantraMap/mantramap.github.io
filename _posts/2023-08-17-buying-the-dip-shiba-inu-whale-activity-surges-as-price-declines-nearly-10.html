Shiba Inu (SHIB), a dog-inspired meme coin, originally dismissed by many as just another fleeting fad, is now drawing serious attention from big players, or &#8220;whales,&#8221; in the crypto space. This attention comes amid the tokens&#8217; recent sloppy launch of its other project, Shibarium. Blockchain security team Beosin recently reported that the newly deployed Shibarium platform has had transactions stalled in a pending state, tying up approximately 1,003 ether, equivalent to $1.8 million in locked funds.¬† üö®Transactions on #Shibarium are stuck in a pending state. $1.7M are currently locked on ETH. Users are advised to temporarily stop using shibarium.https://t.co/io5puAibBc https://t.co/q2SXqtthoO ‚Äî Beosin Alert (@BeosinAlert) August 17, 2023 This sloppy launch has affected the SHIB token negatively seeing the tokens&#8217; price decline by nearly 10% over the past 24 hours. However, despite this plunge whales are reportedly still making moves on Shiba Inu.

Santiment&#8217;s data shows that there&#8217;s been a surge in transfers of SHIB valued at $1 million or higher. According to Santiment, a possible reason for the increase in whale activity could be that these large investors are attempting to &#8220;capitalize on discount prices&#8221; of Shiba Inu and the other cryptocurrencies recording a surge in whale activity Furthermore, this uptick in activity closely follows significant events in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, particularly the mainnet launch of Shibarium, which could be another contributing factor. Shibarium represents a crucial advancement for the SHIB community and its broader ecosystem. And though its launch didn&#8217;t go as planned, its introduction likely plays a role in attracting these large investors and traders to SHIB, looking to capitalize on new opportunities brought about by the platform&#8217;s capabilities.
