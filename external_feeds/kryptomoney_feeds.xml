<li>Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading marginally at $1,270</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-trading-at-this-juncture-implies-one-thing-this-is-what-on-chain-data-says/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> is currently trading marginally at $1,270 after the price slightly recovered at 2023’s start. According to blockchain data provider Glassnode, Ethereum’s 1-month realized volatility has collapsed to 39.8%. The ETH price has only been this stable on three occasions in the past: February 2017, November 2018, and July 2020. Small to medium-sized investors holding between 1 and 100 Ethereum (ETH) have reportedly been accumulating the cryptocurrency in recent years, according to Onchain analytics company Santiment. Only twice on significant occasions have these investors liquidated their ETH holdings: in March 2019 when the price crossed the $150 threshold and in 2020 when it crossed the $500 threshold. This might indicate that these investors are cashing out when they think the price is &#8220;overextended&#8221; or too high. These small to medium-sized investors have been aggressively acquiring ETH since the 2021 crash, demonstrating confidence among the retail crowd. This shows that these investors are ready to hang onto their positions despite short-term market fluctuations because they have faith in ETH&#8217;s long-term potential.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1,700, $1,500, $1,300<br />Support Levels: $1,200, $1,000, $800</p>
<h4>ETH/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="773" class="alignnone wp-image-63870 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-300x156.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-1024x532.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-768x399.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-750x390.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-Daily-Jan-8-1-1140x592.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /></p>
<h6><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The recent slight <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-ethereum-7-day-exchange-outflow-volume-drops-to-lowest-in-two-years-will-this-impact-price/">ETH/USD positive</a> trend must be verified by a sustained break above the $1,300 level, as seen on the daily charts. The moving average (MA 200) might also impede expected growth to the upside. Meanwhile, a break below the daily moving average (MA 50) at $1,240 may briefly temper bullish optimism and might lead sellers to another low.<br /><br />A break above the $1,300 horizontal resistance will show a medium-term bullish bias and potentially signal the continuation of a long-term rebound from the $1,073 low. The ETH/USD pair will need to break through the $2,000 psychological level. A break of $1,000, on the other hand, will continue the long-term downward trend.</p>
<h4>ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63871 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Jan-8-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, the general ETH/USD rally continues, reaching $1,270, with an attempt towards $1,300. Intraday bias has returned to the crucial upper areas today. A clear breakout might have a significantly bullish outcome. The next objective is to breach $1,300 before launching towards $1,500.<br /><br />On the other hand, a breach of the near-term support band at $1,200 would suggest a recent high in the case of a downturn, though the pattern might still be upwards. The uptrend move seen on the moving average can offer the ETH/USD bulls technical support. On the other hand, any descent below $1,200 could incite the bears.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-bitcoin-finishes-2022-down-64-as-whale-addresses-dump-10-75-billion-worth-in-13-months/">Bitcoin</a>’s advance has stalled under the $17,000 mark. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was dabbling at $16,934, marginally up in the last 24 hours. In terms of realized market volatility, December saw little activity. Just 24.6% was the extreme low for Bitcoin&#8217;s 1-month volatility; lower values were only sometimes observed, most notably in November 2018, April 2019, and August 2020. The realized cap drawdown in the 2022–23 Bitcoin bear market was -18.8%, the second-largest in history, only surpassed by the pico-bottom of the 2011 bear market, according to Glassnode. Investors have endured net realized losses totaling $88 billion. On the other hand, small to medium-sized investors holding between 0.1 and 100 BTC in their wallets have generally been accumulating Bitcoin over the past few years, according to Santiment&#8217;s Balance of Addresses metric. These investors have been active buyers since BTC&#8217;s price fell below $20,000 in July last year, increasing their holdings by 9% over the last six months. Overall, it appears that these investors are usually right over the long run, but they might not always be able to foresee short-term price changes.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $20,000 $18,500, $17,500<br />Support Levels: $16,500, $15,500, $13,500</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-bitcoin-tackles-barrier-at-17000-current-bear-market-ranks-second-largest-in-history-per-this-metric/">BTC</a> is holding just above its one-month low at $16,934 and trading within a narrow range at the close of the week, following Saturday&#8217;s mild bounce, which further strengthened its near-term structure. The daily chart studies show receding negative momentum while the relative strength index (RSI) is in recovery mode, which weighs on the near-term structure. <br /><br />Fresh bullish pressure might take on an initial horizontal barrier at $17,500, a break of which would accelerate BTC ascent and expose key resistance at $18,385/$20,000. Diverged moving averages are on track to create a bullish cross and mark solid support, which should cap the market and keep bears in play as soon as a rebound plays out.</p>

<p>BTC/USD started a slight recovery while crossing the 4-hour moving average (MA 200) at the resistance zone of $16,900. The BTC/USD pair bounced above the (MA 50) at the $16,600 level to move into a bullish zone. The pair even broke above the $17,000 level. It traded as high as $17,017 the prior day and is currently consolidating gains. <br /><br />Immediate support is near the $16,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $17,500 level. A break above the $17,500 resistance level could start another increase. In the stated case, it could rise toward the $20,000 resistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-developers-aim-next-hard-fork-shanghai-for-march-2023/">Ethereum developers</a> announced that they are moving forward with a crucial software upgrade that would allow users to withdraw Ether coins used to run the blockchain network during their first online meeting of the year.</p>
<p>The upgrade is anticipated to go live in March, as the developers stated in December. Some important features that many developers wanted to add to the Shanghai update are being deferred to enable token withdrawals as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Shanghai comes after the Merge update, which enabled the network to use staked currencies rather than power-hungry computers to order transactions in September. The modification was dubbed the most ambitious software upgrade ever in that it reduced Ethereum&#8217;s power consumption by roughly 99%.</p>
<p>While the price of Ether increased for several months before the Merge, it has since dropped by around 15% along with much of the rest of the cryptocurrency market due to the repercussions of the FTX exchange&#8217;s collapse in November. More individuals and institutional investors are anticipated to stake their coins in Shanghai to support the Ethereum network and generate yield.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Still Weak, Analyst PlanB Says</h2>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-will-be-spent-more-in-next-bull-run-says-tone-vays/">BTC</a> is displaying weak indications despite starting on a route that is slowly gaining, claims PlanB. In a recent tweet, PlanB, an analyst and the creator of the Stock-to-Flow model, claimed that despite recent advances, Bitcoin is still &#8220;weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relative Strength Index data for bitcoin was used by PlanB to highlight his point. The monthly timeframe BTC RSI on PlanB&#8217;s chart is slightly above 40.</p>
<p>Investors have been encouraged by analysts to be patient, emphasizing that everything is a part of the price cycle. The global stockpile of negative-yielding bonds has disappeared as a result of central banks hiking interest rates at a record rate to battle inflation, which makes it less compelling to earn returns from risky alternative assets like cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#8217; monthly nonfarm payrolls report released on Friday, the US gained 223,000 jobs in December, which is higher than the 200,000 jobs experts had predicted. This is down from the revised 256,000 jobs added in November. In contrast to predictions that the jobless rate would remain at 3.7%, it decreased by 3.5%.</p>
<p>BTC was recently trading at around $16,964, essentially unchanged over the previous 24 hours as investors considered early 2023 economic statistics that appeared to be at odds with one other and the U.S. central bank&#8217;s continuous commitment to raising interest rates for at least the first half of 2023. Ethereum followed a similar trajectory to trade up 1.31% at $1,269.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/52152-2/">Huobi</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore, revealed it would lay off around 20% of its entire workforce after weeks of rumors.</p>
<p><em>“The planned layoff ratio is about 20%, but it is not implemented now. With the current state of the bear market, a very lean team will be maintained going forward,”</em> a Huobi spokesperson said, adding: <em>“The personnel optimization aims to implement the brand strategy, optimize the structure, improve efficiency and return to the top three.”</em></p>
<p>The news comes almost a week after <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1608774459124781059?s=20&amp;t=c99c55iaBDTgpAm7nskqTg">journalist Colin Wu</a> revealed on Dec. 30 that there had been layoffs at the cryptocurrency exchange. Wu reportedly claimed that Huobi has decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1610615698254102529?s=20&amp;t=c99c55iaBDTgpAm7nskqTg">require</a> wage payments to be made in stablecoins rather than fiat money, prompting employee objections.<br /><br />All domestic pay will now be paid in USDT, according to a recent internal Huobi email. Employees must <em>&#8220;to register a Huobi account to receive salary,&#8221;</em> the email adds. It also implies that additional benefits, such as welfare payments, have been terminated along with year-end bonuses. <br /><br />However, the representative for Huobi indicated that the claim that bonuses and benefits have been reduced is false.<br /><br />On October 7, Huobi was purchased by the M&amp;A fund of About Capital Management. A few days later, Huobi named Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, as an advisor. There was widespread speculation that he was the real buyer behind the About Capital transaction, although Sun consistently refuted such allegations. Sun presented a strategy to make Huobi once again one of the largest exchanges in the world in late November. A key component of this ambition is the creation of a hub in the Caribbean.<br /><br />Twitter is already <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=huobi%20communication&amp;src=typeahead_click&amp;f=top">awash</a> with claims that Huobi has shut off internal feedback and contact channels, however, Huobi&#8217;s representative has refuted these claims. <br /><br />The exchange, which is starting a global development strategy, will<em> “fully respect the legitimate demands of local employees, and continue to provide industry-competitive incentives and treatment for outstanding talent.”</em> according to a representative for Huobi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau wants to strengthen the country&#8217;s grip on crypto firms this year ahead of EU-wide regulation set to take effect in 2024.<br /><br />Villeroy made the following <a href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en/intervention/new-year-wishes-2023">statement</a> during a speech on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The disruption seen in 2022 is nourishing one basic conviction: France should switch as soon as possible to the compulsory authorization of DASPs (digital asset service providers) rather than simply requiring their registration,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The French financial regulator, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), now <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/professionals/fintech/my-relations-amf/obtain-dasp-authorisation">offers</a> registration and optional licensing to crypto firms wanting to lawfully deliver services. The coming year may see the implementation of mandatory licensing requirements for crypto asset service providers.<br /><br />The crypto giant <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-appoints-uk-director-mentions-need-to-uphold-regulations/">Binance,</a> as well as Société Générale, one of France&#8217;s largest banks, were granted the French license earlier this year.<br /><br />Regulators from around the world have become concerned as a result of a string of crypto sector collapses and market declines over the past year.</p>
<p>Policymakers encouraged hastened adoption of the EU-wide Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation following the most recent collapse of crypto exchange titan <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-transferred-assets-to-bahamas-government-after-bankruptcy/">FTX</a>. The financial regulators who will be writing the implementation laws in the upcoming year retorted that they are already under time constraints.<br /><br />The MiCA regulatory framework lays out detailed licensing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses. Many policy experts believe that had MiCA previously been in place, the impact of the FTX collapse on Europeans may have been lessened.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The price of<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/trx-price-analysis-tron-trx-hovers-above-0-0120-breaks-past-triangle-structure-as-network-releases-non-obligatory-upgrade-odyssey-3-7/"> Tron (TRX)</a>, the 15th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell on Friday as the overall cryptocurrency market remained stable due to issues related to the cryptocurrency exchange, Huobi.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tron-ceo-foundation-founder-justin-sun-finally-meets-warren-buffet-at-charity-lunch/">Justin Sun,</a> the founder of Tron, is a member of Huobi&#8217;s advisory board. The exchange announced Friday that it would reduce its staff by 20% and mandate that workers receive their pay in stablecoins. To put an end to a mutiny, it also cut down internal staff communications channels, according to sources on Twitter.<br /><br />Before the price of TRX began to change, it decreased by almost 8%. TRX is currently trading at $0.053, a decrease of 1.53% over the previous day. As traders rushed into the current volatility to make profits, TRX trading volume also increased by 314% in the past 24 hours.<br /><br />The USDD stablecoin, which is developed on Tron, lost its intended peg to the US dollar by 3 cents. The USDD stablecoin exchange rate at the time of writing was $0.97. According to DefiLlama data, this price movement led to a 2% decrease in the value locked on Tron-based decentralized applications.</p>
<h2>Justin Sun Moves $100 Million of Crypto To Support Huobi</h2>
<p>TRON founder and crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun transferred around $100 million worth of stablecoins to cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global, which has been hammered by a wave of withdrawals, according to a report by Bloomberg.<br /><br />On Friday, an Ethereum wallet linked to Sun withdrew $50 million of USDT and $50 million of USDC from the Binance exchange and moved the tokens to Huobi around three hours later, according to blockchain research firm Nansen. “It just shows the confidence in Huobi Exchange,” Sun said of the move in a Telegram message. “It’s just my personal funds.”<br /><br />The transactions took place amid increased pressure on Singapore-based Huobi, which, according to statistics from Coinglass, had nearly $85 million in cryptocurrency outflows in 24 hours. The exchange announced on Friday that it would now operate with a &#8220;very lean team&#8221; as the crypto market downturn entered its second year.<br /><br />According to a November Bloomberg News report, Sun invested nearly $1 billion to acquire a roughly 60% stake in Huobi. Moving stablecoins to Huobi <em>&#8220;could be to help with the higher withdrawals or preserve a level of confidence in the exchange,&#8221;</em> Lee, a Nansen data journalist, suggested in a tweet on Friday.<br /><br />Another development is the closure of the wealth management section by cryptocurrency behemoth Digital Currency Group, the latest indication of difficulties amid a severe and protracted downturn in the cryptocurrency market. <br /><br />The Stamford, Connecticut-based company, which also owns brokerage Genesis and asset management firm Grayscale Investments, is coping with some problems after letting go of 10% of its workforce at the end of the previous year. Additionally, Genesis cut more than 60 roles or 30% of its workforce.<br /><br />After the abrupt failure of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-founder-sbf-pleads-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges/">FTX</a>, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, around the end of 2022, the business led by Barry Silbert is coping with changes and difficulties among some of its main subsidiaries.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/avax-price-analysis-avalanche-is-trading-up-in-a-sea-of-red-enters-top-10-as-vaneck-avax-etn-launches/">Avalanche (AVAX)</a> is currently down 1.51% in the last 24 hours at $11.67. Shopify merchants can now mint and sell NFTs through a no-code interface thanks to Venly&#8217;s Avalanche app. Avalanche support has been expanded by Venly, a blockchain technology startup, via its Shopify NFT minting app today. Before recently, only a small number of Shopify users had access to the layer-1 blockchain platform, which is touted as a quicker and less expensive substitute for the leading NFT platform Ethereum. According to the firm, Shopify is a major eCommerce platform that supports the online shops of millions of retailers worldwide. In late 2021, Venly made their Shopify NFT minting tool available on Polygon, the Ethereum scaling network. The second network to be supported is Avalanche. In response to the anticipated rise of Web3 gaming on the platform, the leading NFT marketplace, OpenSea, extended support for Avalanche NFTs in October.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $17.50, $14.50, $12.50<br />Support Levels: $11.35, $10.50, $8.50</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/avax-price-analysis-avax-tackles-barrier-japanese-media-giant-gree-to-build-web3-games-run-nodes-on-avalanche/">AVAX/USD</a> remains in extended sideways mode, hovering around the daily moving average (MA 50) at $12.0, with the psychological $10.50 level providing good support and holding the action for the third week in a row. <br /><br />On the daily chart, technicals are mixed, as momentum continues to be negative, while the relative strength index (RSI) is rising and the moving averages are neutral. The action is supported by growing optimism for a rebound, but it lacks the momentum to break higher.</p>

<p>The Avalanche (AVAX) bounced over concerns that the USD might shift away from its strong stance. The pair bounced off a 4-hour MA 50 and low of $11.34, resulting in a vertical rise above the level of $11.50, which prompted some sellers to close their positions. <br /><br />At the moment, the short-term RSI has returned from the overbought situation, resulting in a temporary pause in the rally as buyers became wary of chasing higher bids. More short-covering could ensue if AVAX stays above $11.00, fuelling the recovery. Then the 4-hour moving average (MA 200) at $12.40 would be the next stop.</p>

<p>The former CEO of the now-defunct cryptocurrency lender<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/celsius-now-directed-to-refund-44-million-to-users/"> Celsius</a>, Alex Mashinsky, is accused of defrauding investors in a case brought up by the attorney general of New York.<br /><br />According to the complaint filed today,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The collapse of Celsius left many individuals in a state of desperation and financial ruin,&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Celsius’s business model was unsustainable. As Celsius proved unable to generate sufficient returns through safe loans and investments, it began to make uncollateralized loans to institutional borrowers and engage in risky strategies on unregulated decentralized finance protocols.&#8221; <br /><br />“As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin,” <span style="color: #333333">said </span><span style="color: #333333">Attorney General Letitia James in a statement.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the civil suit, James and her staff claim that Mashinsky misled investors by claiming that Celsius had $11 billion under management while failing to disclose that the company also had $11.9 billion in liabilities.<br /><br />The civil lawsuit would prevent Mashinsky from running any firm in the state of New York and compel him to pay damages and return investor funds.<br /><br />A judge ruled on Wednesday that digital assets stored in Celsius accounts by customers were considered the company&#8217;s property due to the terms of service. Celsius is also embroiled in a lengthy bankruptcy process in federal bankruptcy court.<br /><br />While promoting its cryptocurrency deposits as being similar to bank accounts, Celsius gave its users substantial interest rates on their holdings. However, such accounts lacked insurance, and the company went down during the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-stablecoin-ftt-reserves-fell-after-binance-threaten-to-sell-token/">stablecoin</a> fall last year. Users are currently rushing to release funds embroiled in legal actions.</p>

<p>The founders of <a href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1611018579532742657">Three Arrows Capital,</a> a failing cryptocurrency hedge fund, were recently served with a subpoena by the Southern District of New York United States Bankruptcy Court. The founders, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu are the targets of the subpoena, which was delivered by liquidators via the well-known social media site Twitter.<br /><br />They have been ordered to allow an inspection of the premises at a specified date and time and to produce all papers in their possession (regardless of whether they are held by them directly or by a third party).</p>
<p>In July, Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy, leaving many investors with no money.<br /><br />The collapse of Three Arrows Capital continues to have an impact on the markets for digital assets. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/genesis-ceo-asks-for-more-time-to-address-lending-issues/">Genesis</a> Global Trading&#8217;s parent company, Digital Currency Group, sued them for $1.2 billion after its subsidiary&#8217;s lending division was compelled to halt new loan originations and redemptions in November. <br /><br />Even though the controversial founders are still active on Twitter, nobody knows where they are. The founders of 3AC were not willing to help, according to a spokeswoman for Teneo Consulting Group, which is in charge of overseeing the bankruptcy processes for 3AC.</p>

<li>ETC was trading at $18.66 at the time of publication</li>
<li>ETC trading volume has increased significantly</li>
<li>The ETC collaboration says it is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Ethercluster to Rivet</li>
</ul>
<p>As its price increased from its low of $15.64 on December 3, ETC, the native asset of the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/etc-price-analysis-ethereum-classic-primed-for-60-rally-in-september-top-mining-pool-announces-support/">Ethereum Classic</a> chain, unexpectedly printed a gigantic green daily candlestick. The daily high of $19.96 was reached on January 4 thanks to the kick, which appeared to break a barrier. ETC was trading at $18.66 at the time of publication, up 21% over the previous 24 hours. Likewise, the Ethereum spinoff has increased by 27% over the previous week. Ethereum Classic, according to blockchain analytics company Sentiment, is experiencing a decent bounce of its own. The statement continued,<em> &#8220;Not only is volume large, but it is also heavily shorted by traders on exchanges.&#8221;</em> Data from <em><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/">CoinMarketCap</a></em> shows that in the past day, ETC trading volume has increased significantly. In other news, the ETC collaboration says it is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Ethercluster to Rivet. The Ethercluster RPC endpoints will be discontinued on July 1, 2023, a notice in a blog post reads.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $30.00, $25.00, $20.00<br />Support Levels: $17.00, $15.00, $13.00</p>
<h4>ETC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63815 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-Daily-Jan-5-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETC/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The bias is turning positive over long and medium terms, and if the breached daily moving average (MA 50) at $18.00 holds as support, a rally toward $25.00 is anticipated. On the other hand, a break and closing below the daily moving average (MA 200) at $25.00 would refocus attention on the $20.00 level. This week, the pair has recovered and might go higher.<br /><br />On the other hand, given the strength of the USD, we might expect further losses below $25.00, with targets not below $20.00. Technically speaking, a breakout south may occur throughout the course of the upcoming trading days. In this case, the $15.00 level can provide support for the ETC/USD pair.</p>
<h4>ETC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63816 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ETCUSD-4-Hour-Jan-5-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>From a technical perspective, the recent breakout toward $20.00 is anticipated to continue during the upcoming trading sessions. In this instance, in the event of a continuous retracement, the horizontal support level of $18.00 might offer support to the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/etc-price-analysis-buyers-push-ethereum-classic-higher-by-14-as-date-for-eths-proof-of-stake-transition-is-unveiled/">ETC/USD pair</a>. The relative strength index (RSI) remains overbought.<br /><br />The initial level of support for the pair is predicted to be $17.00; however, a further breach lower might result in a fall-through that would take it to the next support level of $15.00. The pair is anticipated to encounter its first level of resistance around $20.00, with a subsequent spike pushing it to $25.00.</p>
