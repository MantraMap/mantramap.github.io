					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum is currently following the general crypto market trend at this point and has been posting only slight gains in the last 24 hours. With the bear market in full swing, a large number of cryptocurrencies remain at risk of losing more of their value. However, for Ethereum, there could be a bull trend on the horizon and it has to do with staking on the network. Shanghai Upgrade Will Drive Ethereum Up Currently, compared to the other Layer 1 proof of stake networks in the sector, Ethereum sees the lowest percentage of supply staked. At less than 14 of ETH supply being staked, it comes down to there not being a withdrawal mechanism for those who stake on the network but this could change very soon and bring with it renewed vigor to the market. Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Market Gains, How Long Will This Continue? The Ethereum “Shanghai” upgrade is expected to take place sometime in March 2023 and a Matrixport report shared with NewsBTC via email expects this to be a bull trigger for the digital asset. As it puts it, “it seems extremely likely that more ETH will be staked after March and this could put upward pressure on ETH prices.” The reasoning behind this is a simple one; the more ETH is staked, the less supply in the market, and scarcity leads to higher prices. Instead of staked ETH volume actually declining, it is expected to increase because once withdrawals are possible, investors will be more confident to stake their coins, knowing that they can easily get it back. “With more ETH being staked and removed from circulation, the downside price pressure seems limited as long as ETH remains staked.” Another Rally To $1,600 for ETH The report further elaborates on its expected price reaction for Ethereum following the “Shanghai” upgrade. It notes that the digital asset is already breaking out of its sideways consolidation which is a good thing as such a breakout from previous consolidations had seen ETH rally as high as 39% in 2022. ETH jumps above $1,250 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com So if another breakout such as this were to take place, it is possible that the digital asset could see an over 27% increase just like it did in October 2022. This would obviously bring its price back up to $1,600 with a 27% rally, and above $1,750 with a 39% rally. It also predicts lower volatility for the year 2023, but still expects investors to see a 9.8% increase with a 63% implied volatility for March 23. Related Reading: Bottom Signal: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Falls To Three-Year Lows Besides the factors outlined in the Matrixport report, another thing that could support this bull case is a “buy the rumor” event. These often occur leading up to important upgrades such as “Shanghai” where investors capitalize on the anticipation to drive the price of a digital asset up. Therefore, in the months and weeks leading up to the upgrade in March, multiple rallies could be triggered which would bring ETH’s price to at least $1,500.

					<description><![CDATA[MATIC’s price looks to be holding up quite well in the market given current circumstances, but given how much the crypto’s price has fallen from its 2021 all-time high price, the vast majority of its holders are still nursing losses from their investments. 80% Of MATIC Investors Suffer Losses Data from the on-chain analysis platform IntoTheBlock shows that 80% of MATIC investors are seeing losses at current prices. These analyses take into account the price at which the tokens were moved into a wallet and compare that against the price of the digital asset currently to give these figures. Related Reading: Bottom Signal: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Falls To Three-Year Lows The summary for MATIC puts only 15% of investors currently in profit with 5% at neutral territory, meaning they purchased their tokens at the same prices as the current value of the coin. It also puts into perspective just how much investors have lost. MATIC’s price is down more than 72% from its all-time high price of $2.91, according to data from Messari, but is doing quite well on a year-to-date basis. It is currently sitting at a 147% profit from its cycle low of $0.32 marked on June 18, 2022. 80% of MATIC investors in loss &#124; Source: IntoTheBlock The asset is still mainly dominated by medium-term holders, meaning those who have held their coins between 1-12 months. This holder base makes up 56% of MATIC investors. Long-term holders are still significant at 38% and short-term holders who bought in the last month are sitting at 7%. This shows that despite the losses, it is a digital asset with an investor base looking to hold for the long term. Polygon Is Still A Big Player Even with the bear market, MATIC has been able to show strength in the market. It is now officially one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, placing 10th on the list, with important partnerships that have increased attention on the blockchain. MATIC trending below $0.8 &#124; Source: MATICUSD on TradingView.com One of the most recent of these was the announcement that the DeGods and y00ts NFT collections, which are the largest on the Solana blockchain, would be migrating to Polygon in January 2023. Other notable partnerships include Reddit, Meta, Stripe, Starbucks, Adidas, Disney, and Nike, among others. Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Market Gains, How Long Will This Continue? Polygon’s total value locked (TVL) also surpassed those of competitors such as Solana and Avalanche. This makes it one of the top 5 largest decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems in the crypto sector. MATIC’s price is currently trending between $0.79-$0.8 at the time of this writing. It is down 0.13% in the last 24 hours with a trading volume of $233 million.

These analyses take into account the price at which the tokens were moved into a wallet and compare that against the price of the digital asset currently to give these figures.</p>

<p class="p2">The summary for MATIC puts only 15% of investors currently in profit with 5% at neutral territory, meaning they purchased their tokens at the same prices as the current value of the coin. It also puts into perspective just how much investors have lost.</p>
<p class="p2">MATIC’s price is down more than 72% from its all-time high price of $2.91, according to data from <a href="https://messari.io/asset/polygon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Messari</a>, but is doing quite well on a year-to-date basis. It is currently sitting at a 147% profit from its cycle low of $0.32 marked on June 18, 2022.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-514920 aligncenter" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-05-at-12.42.55.png" alt="MATIC " width="296" height="218" /></p>

<p class="p2">The asset is still mainly dominated by medium-term holders, meaning those who have held their coins between 1-12 months. This holder base makes up 56% of MATIC investors. Long-term holders are still significant at 38% and short-term holders who bought in the last month are sitting at 7%. This shows that despite the losses, it is a digital asset with an investor base looking to hold for the long term.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Polygon Is Still A Big Player</h2>
<p class="p2">Even with the bear market, MATIC has been able to show strength in the market. It is now officially one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, placing 10th on the list, with important partnerships that have increased attention on the blockchain.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/6lSxyU7y/" alt="MATIC price chart on TradingView.com" width="3284" height="1646" /></p>

<p class="p2">One of the most recent of these was the announcement that the DeGods and y00ts NFT collections, which are the largest on the Solana blockchain, would be migrating to Polygon in January 2023. Other notable partnerships include Reddit, Meta, Stripe, Starbucks, Adidas, Disney, and Nike, among others.</p>

<p class="p2"><a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Polygon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Polygon’s total value locked (TVL) also surpassed those of competitors such as Solana and Avalanche</a>. This makes it one of the top 5 largest decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems in the crypto sector.</p>
<p class="p2">MATIC’s price is currently trending between $0.79-$0.8 at the time of this writing. It is down 0.13% in the last 24 hours with a trading volume of $233 million.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A quant has broken down how the Bitcoin MVRV MACD oscillator could be used to check for signals in the price. Bitcoin MVRV MACD Oscillator As Price indicator As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this metric can help detect both the lows and the highs in the price, as well as the greater trends. The &#8220;Bitcoin MVRV&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap and the realized cap. Here, the &#8220;realized cap&#8221; is a capitalization model for BTC that values each coin in circulation at the price at which it was last moved, rather than taking the same current BTC price as the value of all the coins, as the normal market cap does. Since the realized cap is sort of a &#8220;true&#8221; value model for the coin, its comparison with the market cap (in the MVRV) can tell us whether the coin is undervalued or overvalued at the moment. When the MVRV is greater than 1, it means BTC is overpriced right now, while having values below the threshold suggests it&#8217;s underpriced. Now, to use MVRV as a trading tool, the quant has taken the MACD oscillator of the indicator. A MACD oscillator is just the difference between the short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMA) of the metric in question. Here, these EMAs are the 50-day and the 100-day versions.

On the other hand, values less than -0.3 have signaled underbought conditions. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that while these signals haven&#8217;t coincided with the cycle tops and bottoms, they have still correctly indicated some local tops and bottoms.

In the graph, it&#8217;s visible that whenever the MVRV MACD has moved up inside the negative region while the price consolidates sideways or declines, a bullish divergence has formed for Bitcoin. Similarly, a bearish divergence has taken shape when the value of the crypto has been rising, but the indicator has been going down in the zone above zero. At present, none of these signals have formed in the current bear market so far. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $16,800, up 1% in the last week.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quant has broken down how the Bitcoin MVRV MACD oscillator could be used to check for signals in the price.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin MVRV MACD Oscillator As Price indicator</h2>
<p>As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63b66c52c694b7554b14adef-How-to-use-on-chain-data-trading2-MACD-Oscillator" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, this metric can help detect both the lows and the highs in the price, as well as the greater trends. The &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-mvrv-ratio-falls-to-3-year-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin MVRV</a>&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap and the realized cap.</p>
<p>Here, the &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-long-term-holders-own-80-realized-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realized cap</a>&#8221; is a capitalization model for BTC that values each coin in circulation at the price at which it was last moved, rather than taking the same current BTC price as the value of all the coins, as the normal market cap does.</p>
<p>Since the realized cap is sort of a &#8220;true&#8221; value model for the coin, its comparison with the market cap (in the MVRV) can tell us whether the coin is undervalued or overvalued at the moment. When the MVRV is greater than 1, it means BTC is overpriced right now, while having values below the threshold suggests it&#8217;s underpriced.</p>
<p>Now, to use MVRV as a trading tool, the quant has taken the <a href="https://newsbtc.com/topic/macd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MACD oscillator</a> of the indicator. A MACD oscillator is just the difference between the short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMA) of the metric in question. Here, these EMAs are the 50-day and the 100-day versions.</p>

<p>The below chart shows how the Bitcoin MVRV MACD can be used for finding tops and bottoms in the price:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/368049/quicktake/9QHo95ZoV_de238d73294589a0846ed4640be2756a816a6deb189040965e36ed55b842c5e6.png" alt="Bitcoin MVRV MACD" width="1280" height="592" /></p>

<p>According to the quant, whenever the MVRV MACD has been higher than 0.3, it has been a signal that BTC is overbought currently. On the other hand, values less than -0.3 have signaled underbought conditions.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that while these signals haven&#8217;t coincided with the cycle tops and bottoms, they have still correctly indicated some local tops and bottoms.</p>

<p>Now, here is another graph where the analyst has highlighted how divergences between the price and the MVRV MACD can signal future trends:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/368049/quicktake/m5Y7Ydj_45ff2399c7ff70a612e54fc82aabe4bdbd7a367b232737e6bb9533380193f2ae.png" alt="Bitcoin MVRV Trends" width="1280" height="586" /></p>

<p>&#8220;A divergence occurs when the direction of a technical indicator and the direction of the price trend are moving in opposite directions,&#8221; explains the analyst. In the graph, it&#8217;s visible that whenever the MVRV MACD has moved up inside the negative region while the price consolidates sideways or declines, a bullish divergence has formed for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Similarly, a bearish divergence has taken shape when the value of the crypto has been rising, but the indicator has been going down in the zone above zero. At present, none of these signals have formed in the current <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bear-market-momentum-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a> so far.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $16,800, up 1% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) is back to its range after a failed attempt to reclaim previously lost territory, with a likelihood of seeing further losses. The crypto market has seen a weak price action in 2023, but BTC has been notably more fragile than other digital assets.  Related Reading: Research Firm Issues Warning For Bitcoin And ETH Investors Over DCG Situation As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,800 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, BTC records 1% in profits. Over the same period, Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), and others have seen gains north of 6% and 12%. Bitcoin Investors Hedge Their Positions? As price stalls in the Bitcoin spot market, the derivatives sector might provide more clues about price expectations. According to a recent report from crypto exchange Deribit, expectations of a spike in Volatility due to the New Year decreased.  The report claims that market participants have been “hesitant” to jump into the current price action due to ambiguity around macroeconomic conditions. In addition, the crisis between Gemini and the Digital Currency Group (DCG) has added fuel to this sentiment.  The DCG owns crypto lender Genesis, which owes Gemini Earn customers billions of dollars. If the first of these companies decides to liquidate one of their products to pay off their debt, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will likely trend to the downside. Deribit noted: The Option market is dismissing material directional reaction to the Gemini-DCG deadline, and the relatively flat Skew across Terms is not signaling strong bias. Implied Volatility, a measure of the market’s expectation around price movement, has declined. The option sector has been selling off under the current environment; the report notes some buying action around put (bearish) contracts for February and March.  These contracts could be part of a hedging strategy from prominent players with Bitcoin spot positions. If the situation around DCG and Gemini resolves favorably, the market will likely trend higher.  Related Reading: Ethereum Surges 4% As Whales Show Elevated Activity Additional data provided by Deribit reflects the current state of the market, which is dominated by no clear direction. As seen in the chart below, there is a lot of Open Interest, predominantly call option, around $17,000.  This data suggests that market participants expect sideways price action going into the January 27 expiry. As mentioned, the DCG/Gemini situation and macroeconomic developments could shift this situation. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum has seen an upwards push of 4% in the last couple of days as whales have displayed elevated levels of activity. Ethereum Whale Transactions At Highest Level Since December 16th As per data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whales have made 611 transactions in the past day. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;whale transaction count,&#8221; which measures the total number of Ethereum transfers taking place on the chain that is worth more than $100,000. When the value of this metric is high, it means whales are making a large number of transactions right now. Since whale transactions involve the movement of a significant number of coins, enough of them taking place close together can cause visible effects on the price of the crypto. Thus, periods with high values of the metric can be quite volatile. On the other hand, low values suggest whales aren&#8217;t that active at the moment, which can lead to the price not observing any significant action. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum whale transaction count over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively high in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment As the above graph displays, the Ethereum whale transaction count has observed a surge in the past day. During this period of elevated activity, whales have made 611 transactions so far, which is the highest level since December 16, when the price of the crypto saw a sharp downward move and created a local bottom of around $1,160. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Inflows Spike, Is This Bearish For BTC? This spike on the December 16 bottom was higher in magnitude than the current one and was a sign that a large number of whales were buying up the crypto at those low prices. The latest spike, on the other hand, has occurred while the ETH price has been climbing up, as is apparent from the chart. One possibility is that this could imply whales are optimistic about this latest buildup and are thus buying more while they still can. Such backing from these humongous holders could sustain the rally further, and take Ethereum to higher levels. Related Reading: Brace For Impact?

					<description><![CDATA[Renowned crypto firm Arcane Research has issued a warning to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investors in light of the escalating events surrounding Digital Currency Group (DCG), Genesis, and Grayscale. In an article by analyst Vetle Lunde, the firm warns: Investors should pay attention to the ongoing financial distress related to Digital Currency Group (DCG) as the outcome could severely impact crypto markets. In the reasoning behind the warning, Arcane Research states that if DCG goes bankrupt, it could be forced to liquidate its assets. &#8220;This could force DCG into selling its sizable positions in GBTC and unknown positions in ETHE and other Grayscale trusts,&#8221; Lunde said. Further, the analyst argues that a &#8220;natural, less liquidity-constrained&#8221; solution could be a Reg M solution that allows holders of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH), and the other trusts to redeem shares at net asset value. This would resolve the near-record NAV &#8211; the value by which the fund trades below the Bitcoin spot price. GBTC was trading at -45.35% yesterday, while ETH was at a NAV of -55.83%. Dissolution of the trust via Reg M would trigger tangible impacts on crypto markets, as GBTC comprises about 3.3% of the circulating BTC supply and 2.5% of the ETH supply. Related Reading: These Altcoins Will Be Hit The Hardest If DCG And Grayscale Fall Arcane describes the threat to the market in the massive arbitrage opportunities: A Reg M would cause a massive arbitrage strategy of selling crypto spot versus buying Grayscale Trust shares. If this scenario plays out, crypto markets could face further downside. In the long run, however, Arcane Research calls this scenario a positive event, as the crypto market is &#8220;finally relieved of the huge burden&#8221; caused by the &#8220;Grayscale widowmaker trade.&#8221; According to Lunde, this could even be the potential final market bottom event. Bitcoin Facing Final Intrinsic Shock? As NewsBTC BTC reported, the pressure on DCG is growing day by day. Earlier this week, Gemini founder Cameron Winklevoss published an open letter claiming that Barry Silbert&#8217;s DCG was using stalling tactics in bad faith. Winklevoss gave Silbert a deadline of January 8 to return the $900 million in Gemini Earn client funds. Related Reading: Billion-Dollar Hedge Fund Is Betting Against Bitcoin And Grayscale, Not Just USDT If Silbert does not comply, this could culminate in the coordination of a voluntary DCG Chapter 11 filing, according to Arcane Research. In addition, Valkyrie Investments and $3.5 billion asset manager Fir Tree also took the stage. Valkyrie made an offer to become the new sponsor and manager of GBTC while announcing the launch of an opportunistic fund to take advantage of GBTC discounts. Fir Tree has filed a lawsuit, presumably in a tactical move to hurt DCG&#8217;s valuation and reduce the likelihood of investment by third parties. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $16,817, still lacking volatility. Featured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cryptocurrencies offer a world of opportunities. Quick and easy payments, innovative financial services, and inclusivity to previously unbanked regions in the world are all made possible by the crypto ecosystem. But with these opportunities come challenges and risks. Many crypto platforms lack strong operational, governance, and risk practices. These problems have emerged with huge ramifications in 2022 with the collapse of Terra Luna — one of the biggest stablecoins — and FTX — the second biggest exchange that filed for bankruptcy. Beyond these collapses, there are also several high-profile cases of hacking-related theft of customer funds on centralized and DeFi platforms. These problems have reinforced the debate about the importance of private keys. We recently caught up with Georgios Kalmpazidis, co-founder and CEO of Swaps.app, who shared his thoughts on the topic. Q — What do you think about the current security problems plaguing the blockchain industry? Talking about blockchains, maybe this is the most transparent, secure and democratic technology and system humanity has ever created. It’s getting increasingly popular over the years, and today besides crypto, it is widely used in many other fields, such as health care, property, smart contract, etc. Blockchain is a relatively new technology that currently meets several security challenges, but I would like to look at those challenges from two perspectives &#8211; blockchain and users. From the blockchain perspective, most vulnerabilities are related to the sybil, 51% and routing attacks, which are common issues, are successfully taken care of by cyber security professionals. Regarding the user side, the main challenges are phishing attacks and the security of private keys, which are some of the top issues. When we look deeper, the problems here are similar to the ones in traditional financing, and consistently guiding and educating the users is the key to protecting their funds and fighting fraudsters.  It should be one of the top priorities for the companies. Above all the mentioned factors, there is another major problem, which is the biggest roadblocker for the industry&#8217;s organic development. I call it an irresponsible and immature business strategy, which misleads and mistreats the users bringing them enormous losses. Unfortunately, we have several similar cases in the industry that we all can recall. Q — Do you think the collapse of major crypto platforms threatens crypto adoption? The drop in market capitalization and what happened with some of the major crypto platforms during 2022 led to a sense of uncertainty regarding the crypto adoption rate. Past events have eroded trust in the industry and affected the market, raising the urgency over keeping private keys independently and securely. At Swaps.app we are optimistic that the industry will survive after all those collapses. Definitely, the pace would be different, but through more comprehensive regulation, the industry will become much healthier, more trustworthy and more consistent. Q — How important is it for users to hold their private keys? As I mentioned earlier, the security of private keys remains one of the top issues, especially amid the current market situation. It’s the main key to the users’ funds and should be owned and kept by them. Of course, it also depends on the users’ needs and trading behaviour. Many crypto platforms offer custodial wallet services that offer high-level security and protection of the wallet and are convenient for those who actively trade crypto. In this case, users must be picky when choosing between public custodial wallets. Nevertheless, we advise always keeping most of your funds on your private key. Q —- How can crypto users best protect their private keys from being guessed or hacked? When protecting private keys, I always compare it with the situation when we lock the front door after leaving home. We never keep it open or leave the key on the lock. It&#8217;s the same with the private keys.  If it is weak or unprotected, your funds are at risk. The first step, maybe a trivial one, for users to protect their private keys is to keep their credentials private from others. I call it trivial because it sounds basic, but in most cases, users mistakenly share it with hackers during phishing attacks. Also, it’s vital to use keep the two-factor authentication on, avoid simple combinations of passwords, don’t save your password in the browsers, regularly clear the cookies and caches of your browser, and save your credential in a safe way where no one, even a close friend or a family member, has access, use malicious link detection software or apps, improve device security with antivirus software, keep the device system and browser up to date, avoid connecting to the open or public WiFi networks. We constantly remind our users of these simple rules and encourage them to keep their personal information and credentials safe when they buy crypto at Swaps.app. Q —-  What are the security features that crypto platforms need to incorporate to prevent high-profile hacks and scams Security is the cornerstone of the crypto industry, and while platforms compete over price, rates, speed and other important parameters, security wins the competition. After it comes the rest. A cryptocurrency system requires secure creation of cryptographic keys and seeds. Companies shoul examine their organization&#8217;s security measures in this area, paying close attention to confidentiality and unguessable numbers. Maintaining cryptocurrency wallet/key usage integrity is also critical. Risks such as lost or stolen keys or unintentional disclosure of the wallet holder&#8217;s identity can be avoided with best practices such as key storage and more firm ongoing assessments. Q —-   What do you think will be the biggest trend in blockchain for the next 12 months? There are many blockchain trends to look out for in 2023, but the biggest one for me is the wide usage of CBDCs, as more governments will introduce their digital assets. At Swaps.app, we look forward to supporting CBDCs for users and business partners whenever they are public. The rising investment in stablecoins and more interest towards DeFi will be blockchain trends, too, during the next 12 months. Q  —-  What has been the toughest challenge you’ve faced in our industry so far? High velocity and trust issues in the industry were our toughest challenges. I can proudly notice that due to the consistent improvements and updates Swaps.app succeeds in providing high-quality and seamless crypto purchases for customers and quick and secure crypto and fiat payment processing for online businesses. Also, we are very careful and selective about choosing liquidity, fraud-prevention and payment partners, making us a secure crypto platform. During the last 12 months, we’ve finished our integration with industry-leading companies, including TrueLayer, Stripe, Sumsup, and Binance, updated our services, and introduced new coins and features, making a big leap to the next chapter of the company&#8217;s history. Swaps.app is a fully compliant and regulated European crypto company which effectively combines industry-leading security with a blazingly fast and incredibly easy-to-use platform to bring buying and selling crypto to everyone, beginner or expert, company or individual. &#160; Image: Swaps.app blog]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Following Ethereum whale interest in the Lido Finance token, LDO has gained massive momentum over the past week, up by 20%. Whalestats recently reported LDO was one of the most used smart contract tokens among the top 5,000 ETH investors.   While the reason for the token adoption may be quite glaring, its recent spike has begged questions from individuals wondering if whales are actively accumulating the Lido Finance token. Whales Accumulating LDO? According to on-chain data, whales are interested in LDO. LookOnChain reported earlier today some investors received a massive amount of LDO tokens. As on-chain data reveals, 3.5 million tokens were received by an investor, and almost half a million were sold on the market at an average selling price of $1.37. 9 hours ago, when the price of $LDO rose from $1.24 to $1.42, an $LDO investor received 3.5M $LDO ($4.8M) and sold 500,000 $LDO ($685,000) out, with an average selling price of ~$1.37.https://t.co/FNpLOXv8Ad pic.twitter.com/23vrf7KBOb &#8212; Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 5, 2023 Though the sum was large enough to move the LDO market, given the token is not the most liquid asset, LDO survived the massive sell-off, remaining at a solid price.   Related Reading: Lido DAO Shows Strength To Breakout; Will The Downtrend Line Be Invalidated? Aside from that, the rapid increase in trading volume is also a point worth noting on the accumulation of the liquid staking token. LDO trading volume has gone from $9.3 million at the beginning of this year to $85 million at present.  LDO Gaining Momentum Just a few days ago, Lido Finance TVL (total value locked) overtook Maker DAO emerging as the largest DeFi protocol in terms of total value locked. The Liquid staking protocol&#8217;s TVL went from a ranging $5 billion to $5.99 billion. Alongside the protocol TVL increase, Lido’s LDO token also surged amid its TVL rise up by almost 20% in the past week. The reason behind the rapid increase in the momentum of Lido is the Ethereum Merge, which triggered the popularity of liquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance. Following the merge, the total ETH stake in Lido increased 10% from 4.43 million ETH on September 15, 2022, the date of the merge, to 4.9 million ETH today.

LDO and Crypto Market Overview As of now, the momentum on LDO still seems to be solid, sitting at a trading price of $1.39 with a trading volume of $83 million. Regardless, LDO is still down from its historical all-time high of $11.  LDO price trending at $1.384 &#124; Source: LDOUSDT on TradingView.com Overall, LDO is not the only token in the market gaining upward momentum. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have also gained a few percent to the upside.  As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is currently trading at $16,819, with a 24-hour trading volume of $15 billion. In contrast, Ethereum currently trades for $1,251, up by 0.25%, with a trading volume of $4.9 billion in the past 24 hours.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView]]></description>

<p>While the reason for the token adoption may be quite glaring, its recent spike has begged questions from individuals wondering if whales are actively accumulating the Lido Finance token.</p>
<h2>Whales Accumulating LDO?</h2>
<p>According to on-chain data, whales are interested in LDO. LookOnChain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1610817023516499968?s=46&amp;t=-etawpwaYYt2K444BJCuXw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> earlier today some investors received a massive amount of LDO tokens. As on-chain data reveals, 3.5 million tokens were received by an investor, and almost half a million were sold on the market at an average selling price of $1.37.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Though the sum was large enough to move the LDO market, given the token is not the most liquid asset,<a href="https://newsbtc.com/analysis/lido-dao-ldo-struggles-at-1-8-after-ethereum-merge-what-next/"> LDO</a> survived the massive sell-off, remaining at a solid price.  </p>

<p>Aside from that, the rapid increase in trading volume is also a point worth noting on the accumulation of the liquid staking token. LDO trading volume has gone from $9.3 million at the beginning of this year to $85 million at present. </p>
<h2>LDO Gaining Momentum</h2>
<p>Just a few days ago, Lido Finance TVL (total value locked) overtook Maker DAO emerging as the largest DeFi protocol in terms of total value locked. The Liquid staking protocol&#8217;s TVL went from a ranging $5 billion to $5.99 billion. Alongside the protocol TVL increase, Lido’s LDO token also surged amid its TVL rise up by almost 20% in the past week.</p>
<p>The reason behind the rapid increase in the momentum of Lido is the<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/company/the-ethereum-merge-what-is-trading-headed-towards/"> Ethereum Merge</a>, which triggered the popularity of liquid staking protocols such as <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/defi/lido-gets-all-clear-signal-from-blockchain-auditing-experts-statemind/">Lido </a>Finance. Following the merge, the total ETH stake in Lido increased 10% from 4.43 million ETH on September 15, 2022, the date of the merge, to 4.9 million ETH today.</p>

LDO and Crypto Market Overview
<p>As of now, the momentum on LDO still seems to be solid, sitting at a trading price of $1.39 with a trading volume of $83 million. Regardless, LDO is still down from its historical all-time high of $11. </p>

<p>Overall, LDO is not the only token in the market gaining upward momentum. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have also gained a few percent to the upside. </p>
<p>As of the time of writing, <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-facing-pump-whack-market/">Bitcoin</a> is currently trading at $16,819, with a 24-hour trading volume of $15 billion. In contrast, Ethereum currently trades for $1,251, up by 0.25%, with a trading volume of $4.9 billion in the past 24 hours. </p>
