<li>Litecoin started a steady increase above $92 against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>LTC price is now trading above $92 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $85 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $95 and $98 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is showing positive signs above $92 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-27250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. LTC price could climb further if there is a clear move above $95.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, there were mostly positive moves in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-drop-below-1700/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, Ripple, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC formed a base above the $75 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $80 and $92 resistance levels. During the increase, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $85 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. The pair even cleared the $92 resistance zone.</p>
<p>It is now trading above $92 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). A high is formed near $95.00 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $90.40 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75.32 swing low to the $95.00 high. The next major support is near the $85 level and the trend line.</p>
<p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75.32 swing low to the $95.00 high is also near the $85 level. If there is a downside break below the $85 support, the price could accelerate lower toward the $80 level in the near term.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $95 level. A clear move above the $95 level could push the price toward the $98 level. The next major resistance sits near the $100 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $112 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has appeared to be on something of a roll over the past three months, but according to many analysts, the problem <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-faces-low-risk-of-liquidations-induced-price-volatility-after-70-surge/ar-AA19FzSs" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">of volatility is not quite</a> over. In fact, 2023 could be prone to some rather unexpected volatility trends that may lead to a short squeeze, thus causing value losses for the BTC network.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Isn&#8217;t Out of the Woods Yet</h2>
<p>Over the past four or five months, BTC has risen by about 70 percent from where it was at the end of 2023. During that period, bitcoin was trading in the mid-$16K range, a huge dip from the all-time high of about $68,000 per unit it achieved in November of 2021. Nothing could have predicted that bitcoin was going to endure what arguably turned out to be the worst year on record for the world’s number one digital currency by market cap.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the asset is just below the $28K mark, meaning that while there’s still plenty of room to heal, the currency has done much better for itself during the previous quarter, and the digital token is on the road towards recovery.</p>
<p>Still, analysts at Block Ware Solutions don’t think traders and investors are quite out of the woods yet. They said in a recent report that the currency remains prone to price swings, and that the level of volatility they’re predicting could make 2023 another problematic year for the digital asset. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>High open interest relative to market cap means the market could be vulnerable to a short squeeze or liquidation cascade, which would result in a price swing being more volatile than it otherwise would have been due to forced buying or selling, respectively… The medium-term trend of decreasing open interest/market cap has not been broken, which is reassurance that, even in the event of downward volatility, price is most likely not going to decrease to the level it was at to begin the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The futures open interest to market ratio has been trapped in a downward spiral since the collapse of the trading platform FTX in November of last year. Despite the recent price consolidation of bitcoin, investors haven’t been as eager to jump into this arena of bitcoin trading for a while. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>BTC has essentially traded sideways for the past three weeks, yet we haven’t seen a build-up in open interest. This is a signal that the market is still in a risk-off mode.</p></blockquote>
<h2>FTX: A Major Embarrassment</h2>
<p>FTX has affected the crypto space in more ways than anyone could have possibly imagined. The digital currency exchange was listed in the top five exchanges just three years after it came to fruition.</p>
<p>However, it eventually collapsed into a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">heaping pile of bankruptcy</a> and fraud, and its former chief executive is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">now awaiting trial</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dieter Wermuth – a noted economist and partner at Wermuth Asset Management – <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-economy-would-be-better-off-without-bitcoin-as-it-s-a-negative-sum-investment-that-comes-at-a-social-cost-economist-says/ar-AA19E0BE" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained in a</a> recent note that he thinks the overall economy would be better without bitcoin, and that people should try to forget about the currency for a little while.</p>
<h2>Dieter Wermuth on Why Bitcoin is Pointless</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> has been traveling a meandering road over the past two years or so. In 2021, things were really rather solid for the world’s number one digital currency by market cap. It rose to a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of that year and it looked as though the currency was unstoppable.</p>
<p>However, things took a very ugly and drastic turn just a few months later when the asset lost more than $20,000 during the early portions of 2022. Throughout that year, the currency continued to lose value and ultimately fell into the mid-$16K range by the time the end of 2022 rolled along. This means that in just over a year, the asset lost over 70 percent of its value.</p>
<p>Now, the asset appears to be on a turnaround mission, though while there’s been plenty of progress for BTC to enjoy in just the last few months alone, the currency still has a way to go, and apparently, Wermuth doesn’t think this is a path worth taking. He commented that BTC was a wasteful investment that ultimately steals funds away from other things that could lead to valid, legitimate growth of the American economy. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin activities are a negative-sum game. Without crypto, the economy would be better off. There would be more money for consumption and investment… Bitcoin has been brought to market with the narrative that it would be a better, more stable currency than traditional money. This story has been a deception.</p></blockquote>
<p>He says that at this time, bitcoin cannot be widely used as a method of payment, which ultimately works against the asset holding value. He also said that its volatility is a major problem not likely to lead to solid results in the coming future. Lastly, he doesn’t like that it’s not utilized to pay taxes. Wermuth said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back in November 2021, bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization reached 1.27 trillion dollars. When Lehman Brothers went belly up in 2008, a smaller amount of money had triggered the largest financial crisis and the deepest recession of the post-World War period.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Too Much Environmental Damage</h2>
<p>In his final comments, he issued the age-old argument that bitcoin mining is contributing heavily to climate change and to many other environmental problems. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder whether it will be enough to just up regulatory efforts, or to forbid the participation of banks and other financial institutions, or to get rid of these markets altogether (if this is still an option).</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou – a global market strategist with JPMorgan, one of the biggest finance giants in the world – recently gave his <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-has-been-boosted-by-the-banking-crisis-%E2%80%94-and-these-two-other-factors-says-jpmorgan-strategist/ar-AA19xyUZ" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">thoughts on why bitcoin</a> and several other digital currencies are up so high since the beginning of the year.</p>
<h2>Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou Discusses His Thoughts on BTC</h2>
<p>He commented that while <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-crashed-following-news-of-silvergate-shutdown/" data-wpel-link="internal">the banking crisis</a> of recent months has certainly helped bitcoin move along, there are other contributing factors as well. Panigirtzoglou said:</p>
<blockquote><p>For crypto supporters, the U.S. banking crisis exposed the weaknesses of the traditional financial system given banks’ maturity mismatch is susceptible to bank runs. Crypto supporters have been arguing for a long time that the crypto ecosystem is superior, not least because deposits are held in entities such as stable coins, which as a digital form of money market funds, are 100% backed with high quality liquid assets and are thus less susceptible to runs.</p></blockquote>
<p>He says the launch of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-ordinals-nfts-are-bringing-the-space-back-from-disaster/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin ordinals</a> – the new non-fungible token (NFT) series that’s now available via the bitcoin blockchain – is a huge deal given how often NFTs are distributed via the Ethereum chain. He says this is going to open several doors not only for NFTs, but for bitcoin, and that more developers will likely be attracted to the network in the future when looking to establish new projects. Panigirtzoglou mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is because metadata such as text [and] images can be inscribed on the bitcoin network itself without relying on smart contracts as seen with other blockchains, where NFTs are created through smart contracts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, he believes the upcoming bitcoin halving – which is slated to occur in April of 2024 – is helping with the newfound bitcoin bull run. He commented that many people are becoming mentally and psychologically prepared for the maneuver, which should happen in about 12 months, and that every time, without fail, bitcoin experiences heavy price surges when a halving takes place. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>While this is some way away [from] ceteris paribus, this would mechanically double bitcoin’s production cost to around $40K, creating a positive psychological effect. This is because bitcoin’s production cost has historically acted as an effective lower bound.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Asset Has Really Shot Up</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of 2023, the price of bitcoin has shot up by more than 70 percent, a huge change from where it was during the previous year. 2022 was arguably the worst year on record for bitcoin, with the world’s number one digital currency by market cap dropping from its new all-time high of about $68,000 (which it achieved in November of 2021) to the mid-$16K range. It was a sad sight to see.</p>
<p>However, the price of the asset has endured a few bullish pushes over the last four to five months, and the currency appears to be well on its way to reversing itself.</p>

TRX’s price could rise further if it clears the $0.070 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, Tron price started a decent increase from the $0.0670 support zone against the US Dollar. TRX’s price remained well-bid and was able to climb above the $0.0688 zone.</p>
<p>It traded above the $0.0692 and $0.0695 levels to move further into a positive zone. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $0.0695 a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0685 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>A high is formed near $0.0711 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above $0.0700 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-fresh-increase-to-0-072-seems-likely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.071 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.072 level. A close above $0.072 could send the price toward the $0.0735 resistance zone. Any more gains might send TRX price toward $0.075, above which the price could even rise toward $0.080.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $0.0685 level. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0685 on the 4-hours chart. The trend line is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0640 swing low to the $0.0699 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is now forming near $0.070 or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0668 swing low to the $0.0711 high.</p>
<p>If there is a downside break below the $0.070 support, the price might revisit the $0.0688 support or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0668 swing low to the $0.0711 high. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $0.067 zone in the near term.</p>

<li>Bitcoin price is correcting losses from the $26,000 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near $27,000 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $27,250 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $27,250 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is rising from $26,000 against the US Dollar. BTC might eye another increase if the bulls remain active above the $26,250 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-turns-red-below-29k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">fresh decline</a> below the $28,000 support zone. There was a clear move below the $27,500 and $27,200 support levels. The pair even tested the $26,000 support zone.</p>
<p>It traded as low as $25,810 and recently started a fresh increase. There was a break above the $26,500 resistance zone. The price gained pace once it broke the $26,800 resistance zone and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $29,850 swing high to the $25,810 low.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is now trading near $27,000 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-extend-losses-below-27000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $27,200 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $27,250 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>The next major resistance might be near the $27,850 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $29,850 swing high to the $25,810 low.</p>
<p>A clear move above the trend line and $27,850 might send the price toward $28,500, above which the price might rise toward the $29,200 level. Any more gains might push the price toward the $30,000 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a fresh decline below the $26,750 level.</p>
<p>The first major support is near $27,250. The next key support is near the $27,000 level, below which the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $26,000 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article will share the eight best cryptocurrencies to invest in Australia in 2022. So, if you&#8217;re based in Australia and planning to invest in crypto this year, this article will help you make the best decision.</p>
<p>In the same way, Australian investors are increasingly financing cryptocurrencies and adding them to their investment portfolios for diversity. In addition, there are around 15,000 cryptocurrencies, which are growing every day.</p>
<p>Because of that, choosing a suitable virtual currency to invest in is one of the essential elements in achieving a positive return on investment. Indeed, we want that you don&#8217;t lose money on bad choices. Further, to ensure your investment goes on the right, you must know <a href="https://www.business2community.com/au/cryptocurrency/buy-bitcoin" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">how to buy bitcoin in Australia</a>, the ways, and the steps guide. Generally, people pick the most well-known coins when investing in cryptocurrencies in Australia.</p>
<p>However, there are varied causes for picking a well-known cryptocurrency. Reason number one is security issues.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a beginner, it&#8217;s very important to learn how to buy bitcoin in Australia. Read on to get begun with the best Australian cryptocurrencies in 2022.</p>
<h3>Top 8 Profitable Cryptocurrency in Australia in 2022</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;re eight of the most profitable cryptocurrencies you can invest in after finding the perfect one. Let&#8217;s say something about each one below.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin (BTC) &#8211; The Most Popular Cryptocurrency 2022</h3>
<p>In addition, Bitcoin has been around for the most extended of any cryptocurrency. It was the first cryptocurrency publicized in 2009, celebrating the start of the cryptocurrency generation. Thus, it launched the foundation of digital money.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin is still the most famous cryptocurrency for Australians to fund. Likewise, Bitcoin is the first decentralized online money, permitting wallet holders to achieve quick, safe, and cost-effective P2P trades.</p>
<p>Beyond all this, using Bitcoin, you may earn houses, luxury items, automobiles, services, food, and beverages, among other items. Despite this, numerous vendors now approach Bitcoin as gold instead of digital money.</p>
<p>Hence, Nakamoto restricted the total number to 21 million coins, and Bitcoin has evolved significantly expensive as its circulation has fallen. Moreover, Bitcoin gained a record of $65,000 in April 2021. But it may seem just overstated to indicate that it will shortly exceed $100,000. Bitcoin will surprise us soon as it did before.</p>
<h3>Ethereum (ETH) &#8211; Trade Just Anything With</h3>
<p>Ether (ETH) is the native currency on the Ethereum network, a well-known open-source ledger technology that allows decentralization. Thus, in 2013, Vitalik Buterin created the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether. After that, in July 2015, the Ethereum blockchain became online, with 72 million ETH currencies pre-mined.</p>
<p>Except for Bitcoin, there is no lid on the number of Ether that may develop, making it potentially more adaptable. Further, those confused about which cryptocurrency to invest in should consider Ether. Despite this, Ethereum is open at significant sales that allow you to buy cryptocurrency online in Australia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has a variety of real-world applications. Its biggest power, though, is undoubtedly its fundamental ties to the Ethereum blockchain, which has overall recognition and credibility.</p>
<p>Also, its declared ambition is to allow users to &#8220;codify, secure, decentralize, and trade just about anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore, if completely recognized, it can boost whole economies. Moreover, Ether itself has extremely speedy transaction times. Also, its market worth has even risen dramatically over the last five years.</p>
<p>Accordingly, numerous top billionaires who purchase cryptocurrency in Australia visit cryptocurrency exchanges daily to grow their Ether asset portfolio. As a result, it is calculated that the importance of Ethereum will be at $7,190 by the end of December 2022. Great news for you.</p>
<h3>Dogecoin (DOGE) &#8211; The Most Attractive Coin</h3>
<p>DOGE has to be one of the leading cryptocurrencies to purchase this 2022. Dogecoin is one of the most attractive coins. Particularly with Elon Musk spearheading the discussion on Twitter every time.</p>
<p>Further, it is supported by one of the most significant futures in crypto. The community behind it also keeps pushing. Also, the coin, which utilizes an image of the Shiba Inu as its avatar, is accepted as a form of payment by some major companies, including the Dallas Mavericks, Kronos, and SpaceX, an American aerospace factory possessed by Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Hence, Dogecoin was made by two software engineers, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, in 2013. However, Markus and Palmer reportedly produced the coin as a parody, commenting on the wild hypothesis of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>So the fee of DOGE hit an all-time high of approximately 0.74 cents during the week when Musk was scheduled to appear on Saturday Night Live.</p>
<h3>Litecoin (LTC) &#8211; Litecoin &#8211; Second Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Accordingly, Litecoin (LTC) was established in 2011. Surely, it was the first cryptocurrency to follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin. Also, it has usually been referred to as &#8220;silver to Bitcoin&#8217;s gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hence, Charlie Lee, an MIT graduate and former Google engineer designed it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Litecoin is founded on an open-source international payment network. It&#8217;s not maintained by any central authority and uses the script as a PoW, which can be decoded with the help of consumer-grade central processing units (CPUs).</p>
<p>Thus, Litecoin is like Bitcoin in many forms. For example, it has a quicker block generation rate and thus proposes a faster trade confirmation time. As a result, other than developers, numerous sellers accept Litecoin.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) &#8211; The Great Investment Choice</h3>
<p>Bitcoin Cash is the result of a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, which happened in August 2017. It is a crypto that focuses on peer-to-peer online transactions and wants to make paying with crypto easy, simple, and cheap.</p>
<p>If you believe that cryptocurrency will continue to grow, you would also believe that Bitcoin will become less and less usable for typical transactions. But on the other hand, if you think that Bitcoin Cash and its workable solution to the scaling problem are the future of peer-to-peer transactions, then Bitcoin Cash is a wise investment choice.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Coin (USDC) &#8211; Great and Steady Coin</h3>
<p>Truly, US Dollar Coin (USDC) is another great and steady coin. It&#8217;s exchangeable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars, funded by dollar-denominated assets kept in segregated accounts with US-regulated financial institutions.</p>
<p>Likewise, USDC is charged by Ethereum. It makes a stablecoin just like Tether. Hence, the use case of USDC is similar to USDT. Such as investors utilizing it for arbitrage or crypto conversion opportunities.</p>
<h3>Ripple (XRP) &#8211; Low Transaction Fees</h3>
<p>The XRP is one of the most famous cryptocurrencies on this list. Surely, it&#8217;s a helpful token providing lower transaction fees and fast transactions. In addition, it helps make cross-border financial transactions more efficient. Hence, by working with financial institutions, Ripple lowers currency exchange rates and provides real-time exchange rates.</p>
<p>Further,Ripple, the company that issued XRP, has proved its reputation as the most sought-after partner of many countries in creating digital currencies. Also, Ripple&#8217;s technology is being operated by hundreds of banks to promote transactions across the world.</p>
<p>Before Ripple, banks usually had to use intermediates for cross-border transactions. Indeed, these were costly and could take days to finish. But, Ripple has significantly improved efficiencies in how cross-border transactions operate. For an investor, this shows that Ripple is providing real matter in the world beyond the basic stock or exchange of value premise.</p>
<h3>Tether (USDT)</h3>
<p>Unlike some cryptocurrency rivals, Tether is a type of &#8216;stable coin.&#8217; Stable coins attempt to peg their market value to an external reference. For Tether, this indicates it&#8217;s backed by regular &#8216;fiat&#8217; currencies such as UK pounds, US dollars, or the euro and hypothetically holds importance equal to one of those denominations.</p>
<p>As a result, Tether&#8217;s value, the theory runs, ought to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies. Also, it cares to be favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This article is a clear walkthrough of the eight best cryptocurrencies you must invest in if you are based in Australia. Which one offers an attractive upside potential for you in 2022.It&#8217;s time to find your best crypto that is perfect for you and make your first investment(if you&#8217;re a beginner). Then, start investing full of safety, low cost, and the simplest way.</p>
<p>Further, choosing one specific cryptocurrency as the best investment in Australia is not easy. So if you&#8217;re new to cryptocurrency, and looking for the best token for beginners, then start with Bitcoin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone keeps talking about crypto regulation as of late. It appears the topic has gained a lot of steam since crypto <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">exchange FTX collapsed</a> into a steaming pile of bankruptcy and fraud.</p>
<h2>Regulation Should Wait Until We Can Replace Those in Charge</h2>
<p>Under normal circumstances, a situation like this would indeed serve as a bridge to regulation, but in many ways, right now is probably the worst time to instill any sort of regulatory oversight in the crypto space.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this, one big one being who’s in charge. When one considers the level of incompetence they’ve witnessed over the last few years, they realize that those tasked with running their countries (and ultimately, the world) aren’t up to the job. Look at Janet Yellen, for example. This is a woman <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Janet-Yellen" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">with a Ph.D. in economics</a> from Yale. Serving as the United States’ current Treasury Secretary, Yellen commented in 2021 that she <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/01/janet-yellen-admits-she-was-wrong-about-inflation/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">felt inflation was a problem</a> that would ultimately fix itself.</p>
<p>You have a Ph.D. in economics and statements like <em>that</em> are coming out of your mouth? Under Yellen’s hand, the U.S. economy has fallen into a complete state of disarray. Food and gas prices have reached new highs, inflation is the worst it’s been in over 40 years, and job numbers continue to be disappointing. Do we really want someone like this to have anything to do with the crypto industry? She can’t even handle the arena of standard finance, which has been around for hundreds of years. What makes anyone think she’ll competently reside over the still infant digital currency space?</p>
<p>Fed chair Jerome Powell has also proven incapable. His solution <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">to everything has just</a> been to hike rates. Despite everything showing him regularly that this methodology isn’t working, he can’t seem to change his mind or implement new tactics for fighting the economic downfall of America.</p>
<h2>Nobody Knows What They&#8217;re Doing!</h2>
<p>Right now, crypto prices are trying to make a comeback after suffering at the hands of his rate hikes during 2022. In addition, many people have been shut out of the American dream and can no longer afford homes or cars or anything else that might require a loan given the interest rates are practically unaffordable, but in the end, not much has really changed. Inflation is still a problem, and what did Jerome Powell say recently about it? <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rates-again-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">That 2023 would likely</a> be a year of continued hikes, meaning we can look forward to more of the same over the next seven months.</p>
<p>Some might think that regulation is the only thing that can save crypto from situations like FTX, but while there may be a degree of truth to this, fans may want to wait on their calls for regulation until the American political spectrum can endure a few necessary changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin marketplace Paxful <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/drugs-erratic-dismissals-and-feuding-founders-behind-bitcoin-marketplace-paxfuls-unraveling-1032221094" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">has closed its doors</a>, meaning the digital currency space is still not yet out of the woods when it comes to exterior, negative circumstances.</p>
<h2>Paxful Says Goodbye</h2>
<p>Paxful used to be one of the most prominent, well-known bitcoin marketplaces in the world. Employing 200 people, the company was run by Ray Youssef and Artur Schaback. The company was founded in 2015 and saw more than $5 billion in BTC trades at the hands of roughly 12 million users.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, however, Youssef claimed that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/paxful/" data-wpel-link="internal">Paxful</a> has been trapped in the doldrums for some time, saying that “key staff departures” and “regulatory challenges” eventually made it so that the enterprise could no longer operate. He also said he’s been struggling to see eye to eye with his co-founder Schaback, and that their differences eventually got in the way of the firm’s future.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been several reports – either through former employees coming forward or in various lawsuits issued by past staffers – that the daily cannabis use from people like Youssef (currently 46 years of age) grew into something that aided in the depletion of the company’s resources. The former employees now engaged in lawsuits against Paxful say the enterprise suffered from unprofessional management that got in the way of the firm’s functionality.</p>
<p>Schaback is also suing Youssef in a separate lawsuit, claiming he was cut out of the company’s computer network and data information systems while he was on paternity leave. He also says Paxful’s coffers were looted by Youssef and his cronies and that his co-founder went so far as to try and avoid international sanctions on “transactions into and out of Russia.”</p>
<p>He mentioned in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Youssef took unilateral action to permanently shut down Paxful. His plan has been going for the better part of 15 months, but thanks to our civil proceedings in the United States, his plan was discovered and thwarted.</p></blockquote>
<p>By contrast, Youssef is hitting back and said that Schaback was fired from his position as COO with the company due to his growing “incompetence and bad behavior.” He also said that Schaback was a huge contributing factor in the closure of the firm. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was clear to everyone at the company that Schaback did not have any understanding of what a COO was supposed to do.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How the Pair Met</h2>
<p>Youssef met Schaback at a 2014 bitcoin event. A year later, they formed what became Paxful, and it appeared that the company had been on a steady roll since that time. Who would have known that so many ugly cracks had been forming in the foundation? Schaback concluded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>We met because we believed the idea of bitcoin helps the little guy.</p></blockquote>
