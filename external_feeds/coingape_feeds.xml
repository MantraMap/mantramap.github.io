After the local bottom of the Ethereum price on December 16, large wallet investors in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> began scooping up ETH tokens in bulk. And, due to the whales&#8217; increased activity over the past several days, Ethereum has experienced a 5% increase in price.</p>
<h2>Massive Whale Activity Recorded</h2>
<p>Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, reported that 611 transactions were made by whales throughout the course of the previous day; which was valued to be more than $100,000. However, on Thursday, this number picked up steam and raced towards 419 transactions which totaled to be around a whopping $1 million.</p>
<p>The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1611039830003298304" rel="nofollow">data</a> also suggested that there was an ever-increasing demand for Ether among the whales, which lends credence to the previous statement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134376" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06015956/FluPb-TacAAyvKs1.jpg" alt="" width="2952" height="1853" /></p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge</h2>
<p>This spike reported by Santiment is of a higher magnitude than the one recorded on December 16. One interpretation of this data point is that it indicates <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/">whales are bullish</a> about the altcoin and are consequently purchasing more while the opportunity exists. This kind of support from such enormous holders might keep the surge going and drive Ethereum prices further higher.</p>

<p>After the successful shift from the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/">proof-of-work</a> consensus process to the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/#:~:text=Proof%20of%20Stake%20is%20a,them%20to%20the%20existing%20blockchain.">proof-of-stake</a> consensus mechanism, the next key milestone for ETH holders will be the unstaking of Ethereum from the December 2020 contract. In recent weeks, developers have placed a higher priority on the token unlock than on other upgrades to the ecosystem, and have scheduled it to take place after the <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-price-prediction-why-eth-price-could-see-major-selling-ahead/">Shanghai hard fork</a>.</p>
<p>As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,259. This represents an increase of 0.02% in the past 24 hours, which is in contrast to its increase of 4.9% during the last seven days, as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

The ongoing bullish sentiment in the crypto market assisted buyers in driving prices 7.6% higher within a week and reached the current price of $0.00000852. This bullish rally also breaks the overhead resistance trendline, offering a long-entry opportunity for interested traders.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wedge pattern breakout sets Shiba Inu price for a 22% rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing below the falling will undermine the bullish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $271 Million, indicating a 143% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bt8l6DOM.png" alt="Shiba Inu Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the last two months&#8217; downfall in the Shiba Inu coin, the daily technical chart showed the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>. Under the influence of this pattern, the prices fell inside two converging trendlines and reached a low of $0.000007869 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this pattern formation indicates a losing bearish momentum as prices fail to achieve a longer downfall. Furthermore, with the recovery sentiment developing in the crypto market since the beginning of 2023, the SHIB price has steadily risen since last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the bullish rally backed by rising volume indicates that buyers are committed to this growth. Moreover, the Shiba Inu coin shows a 3% intraday jump, which breaches the pattern’s resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-official-shibarium-account-update-launch/">Breaking: Shiba Inu’s Official Shibarium Account Shares Update On Launch</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish breakout is an early sign of price recovery and offers a long entry opportunity for interested trades. Thus, if the breakout sustains above the trendline, the buyers will drive the price 22% higher to hit $0.0000104. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the potential rally may face in-between resistances of 50-day EMA and $0000096 before hitting the mentioned target.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, if the daily candle closes below the trendline, the bullish thesis will get invalidated, and the coin price may witness a longer correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a>, which represents the strength of current price action, has surged above the midline. The indicator value of 52% indicates a positive sentiment building up for SHIB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> Along with $0.0000086 resistance, the 50-day EMA acts as a strong resistance and tries to undermine the potential rally.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.00000865 and $0.0000096</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels: $0.0000075 and $0.00000664</span></li>

This has led to a strong indication of the financial instability that the crypto giant currently faces and also raises doubts about its sustainability in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>.</p>
<h2>Genesis 2nd Round Of Layoffs</h2>
<p>The company sustained significant losses as a result of the provision of loans to the trading firms like <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>, and to prominent cryptocurrency hedge fund <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/three-arrows-capital/">Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</a> back in 2022. Due to the financial crisis faced by these firms, bankruptcy petitions were submitted to courts while cryptocurrencies took a sharp nosedive; erasing all the gains they made earlier.</p>
<p>As reported earlier on CoinGape, Genesis had laid off another 20% of their 260-person workforce during the summer of 2022. However, the failure of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> only made matters worse for the company. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-lender-genesis-lays-off-30-of-staff-11672939434" rel="nofollow">information</a> obtained, Genesis had extended credit in the amount of at least hundreds of millions of dollars to FTX&#8217;s sibling trading firm Alameda Research, before the latter&#8217;s collapse in November. It also made sizeable contributions to the 3AC hedge fund, which was reported to be around $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman of Genesis was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we continue to navigate unprecedented industry challenges, Genesis has made the difficult decision to reduce our head count globally. These measures are part of our ongoing efforts to move our business forward</p></blockquote>
<h2>Genesis On The Verge Of Bankruptcy?</h2>
<p>On November 16th, Genesis temporarily ceased new loan funding and principal repayments. Due to Genesis&#8217;s action, Gemini, a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> that collaborated with Genesis on a yield scheme, has also suspended withdrawals worth $900 million from their Earn program. For survival, Genesis has even turned to investors for a $1 billion emergency loan. Attempts were made to secure funding from private equity powerhouses like Apollo Global Management and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">leading crypto exchange Binance</a>.</p>

<p>This week, the company&#8217;s interim CEO, Derar Islim, informed its clients that the firm was <a href="https://coingape.com/genesis-ceo-solution-requires-more-time-winklevoss/">working towards finding a solution</a> for its borrowing and lending arm, even though, it would require additional time to do so. This came after Gemini’s co-founder Cameron Winklevoss penned an <a href="https://coingape.com/barry-silbert-dcg-genesis-geminis-cameron-winklevoss-funds/">open letter</a> highlighting the delay in resuming withdrawals, which they owe to their customers.</p>
<p>Increasing interest rates and concerns about an economic slowdown have caused investors to flee riskier assets, which has roiled the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, the recent bankruptcies and the recent layoffs, have led many to doubt Genesis&#8217; feasibility and survival in the broader crypto industry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the attorney general of the state of New York filed a civil lawsuit against Alex Mashinsky, founder of the crypto-focused company Celsius Network; accusing him of plotting to defraud hundreds of investors by inducing them to deposit billions of dollars in digital assets with his crypto-lending product. Mashinsky is charged with breaking the <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-sued-new-yorks-attorney-general/" title="Breaking: Celsius Ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky Sued By New York&#8217;s Attorney General"></a></p>

Mashinsky is charged with breaking the state&#8217;s Martin Act, which provides Attorney General Letitia James extensive authority to pursue civil &amp; criminal charges involving securities fraud and other violations.</p>
<h2>Celsius&#8217; Alex Mashinsky Sued</h2>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Celsius&#8217;s former CEO misled investors about the lender&#8217;s financial stability and concealed its precarious status when it lost hundreds of millions of dollars on risky and questionable bets. Mashinsky made the erroneous notion that Celsius lent assets to only reliable organizations and that it was a safer alternative to the banks.</p>
<p>While speaking on Celsius&#8217; fraudulent activities &amp; its following bankruptcy, Ms. James, a prominent Democrat was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin. The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal.</p></blockquote>

<p>As of 31st of December 2021, the office of Ms. James reported that more than 26,000 residents of New York had deposited around $440 million into the now-bankrupt Celsius Network.</p>
<h2>Severe Charges To Be Levied</h2>
<p>In addition to seeking restitution and damages, Ms. James is demanding that Mashinsky be prohibited from conducting business in the state of New York &#8212; that is in any way connected to the issuance or sale of securities and commodities. In addition to that, she further wants to prevent the former CEO from holding any official <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="nofollow">positions</a> in businesses that are active in the state.</p>
<p>In 2017, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alex-mashinsky/">Alex Mashinsky</a> released Celsius, advertising it as a secure and risk-free investment option. The company expanded rapidly over the course of five years, becoming one of the top crypto lenders and eventually handling over $20 billion in assets. In July, as the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> plummeted and withdrawals were frozen, the company filed for bankruptcy.</p>

This led to the Terra Classic validator KuCoin fall in voting power down to 0.21% and rank to 44th on the validator list.</p>
<p>KuCoin on Thursday revealed that it will continue the pledge of LUNC tokens after the 14-day lock period. The reason to undelegate LUNC tokens was part of a normal node switch.</p>
<h2>KuCoin To Redelegate Terra Classic (LUNC) Tokens</h2>
<p>Terra Classic influencer and YouTuber ClassCrypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1611011617814188032" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on January 5 revealed that validator KuCoin will <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">continue pledging their 48 billion </span><span class="r-18u37iz">Terra Classic (LUNC)</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> delegation</span>. Meanwhile, KuCoin now ranks 46th on the validator list and has a voting power of 0.19%.</p>
<p>A Twitter user asked KuCoin if the crypto exchange is going insolvent or stepping back from running validators. He noted that <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-price-soars-5-developments-proposals-burns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KuCoin</a><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> began undelegating all of their holdings on their validators related to </span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNC</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">, </span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNA, and</span> <span class="r-18u37iz">ATOM.</span></p>
<p>In response, KuCoin <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/KuCoinUpdates/status/1610938001932308480" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> the <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">KuCoin validator undelegated 48 billion Terra Classic (</span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNC)</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> as the pledge node of the internal financial account switched. However, the crypto assets belonging to users are marked safe. Moreover, the validator will continue to pledge LUNC tokens after the 14-day lock period.</span></p>
<p>Recently, the community noted several validators announcing ending support for LUNC staking and asked users to redelegate their LUNC tokens to another validator.</p>
<p>FUD sparked in the Terra Classic community after KuCoin undelegated all 48 billion LUNC tokens last week. Some even removed their LUNC tokens and transferred them to Binance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-price-soars-5-developments-proposals-burns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 11168 by Terra Classic</a> core developers Edward Kim and Tobias “Zaradar” was passed by the community. It formed a “Joint L1 Task Force” team, which now looks into the maintenance upgrades and L1 layer developments on the Classic <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a>.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price To Rally Again?</h2>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) price rallied nearly 50% in the last few days due to a breakout above the 3-month descending channel. However, a market-wide selloff and <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-suspends-terra-classic-lunc-burn-lunc-price-falls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance temporarily suspending</a> LUNC burn caused the LUNC price to fell below $0.00015.</p>
<p>The LUNC price is currently trading at $0.00015. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001516 and $0.0001598, respectively.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">The report found that <strong>$3.7 billion was lost to hacks in 134 different hacking incidents</strong>, and <strong>$174 million was lost to fraud in 34 different scams.</strong></p>
<p style="color: #252525">The majority of those funds were lost by four projects: Ronin Network, BNB Chain, Wormhole, and FTX.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">While it may appear to be a large sum of money to get stolen and scammed, it is down 51.2% from 2021, when over $8 billion was stolen, according to the report.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">Major Loss Trends</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">According to the report, hacking proved to be the predominant cause of losses, accounting for 95.6% of total losses. Whereas, frauds, scams, and rug pulls accounted for 4.4% of the total losses.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">Both <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralised finance (DeFi)</a> and centralised finance (CeFi) took hard hits in 2022. 2022 witnessed  the implosion of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem and the downfall of the centralised crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">In addition to this, DeFi was the main target for hacking, accounting for 80.5% of total losses, while CeFi accounted for 19.5%.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">In 2022, DeFi losses soared by 56.2% to $3.18 billion (in 155 different incidents), from $2 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, CeFi&#8217;s losses decreased by 87.3%, from $6 billion in 2021 to $768.8 million in 2022.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The BNB Chain and Ethereum were the two most targeted <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchains</a> in 2022, with 65 and 49 incidents, respectively. BNB Chain and Ethereum accounted for 63.3% of all blockchain attacks. Solana came in third with 12 incidents, or 6.7% of overall attacks in 2022.</p>
<p>Crypto &#8220;losses&#8221; are likely to be in the billions in 2023 unless all projects, blockchains, protocols, and other digital asset organisations prioritise security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="675" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05201111/image-1455.png" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Silvergate Stock Crash" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>On Thursday, shares of Silvergate Capital have been hit hard and are currently on a steady decline of nearly 50%. This comes after the crypto-focused bank revealed its preliminary results for the final quarter which showed a large number of crypto withdrawals. The total deposits made by clients of digital assets fell to nearly $3.8 billion by the end of the fourth quarter in 2022; representing a fall of almost 68% from its previous closing figure of $11.9 billion.</p>
<h2>Silvergate Stock Price Crashes</h2>
<p>The withdrawals took place at the same time the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, one of Silvergate&#8217;s clients, shut down in the midst of a crisis, which raised concerns regarding the reliability of the digital asset business. According to Silvergate, there is currently a &#8220;crisis of confidence across the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silvergate&#8217;s CEO Alan Lane was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>In response to the rapid changes in the digital asset industry during the fourth quarter, we took commensurate steps to ensure that we were maintaining cash liquidity in order to satisfy potential deposit outflows,</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;At the end of December, $150 million of the bank’s deposits were held by customers who had filed for bankruptcy protection&#8221;, Silvergate stated in its official announcement on Thursday.</p>
<h2>Silvergate&#8217;s Weak Q4 Stats</h2>
<p>The fourth quarter of 2022 saw a 68% decline in deposits tied to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>, according to the bank&#8217;s early publication of quarterly data. The corporation liquidated the debt it had on its balance sheet in order to cover the withdrawals.</p>

<p>This also includes an impairment charge of $196 million relating to the buyout of Diem from Facebook (now <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/meta/">Meta</a>) back in early 2022. In addition, Silvergate disclosed that it will be terminating the employment of around 200 employees, which accounts for approximately 40% of the company&#8217;s total staff, and will also be leaving the mortgage warehouse lending sector.</p>
<p>While speaking about <a href="https://coingape.com/silvergate-ditches-its-digital-currency-plan-writes-off-196-mn-in-crypto-acquisition/">Silvergate&#8217;s detachment from the digital currency Diem</a>, the firm stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the significant changes in the digital asset industry landscape, this charge reflects the company’s belief that the launch of a blockchain-based payment solution by the company is no longer imminent,</p></blockquote>
<p>A significant bounce that Silvergate experienced on Wednesday when its shares gained by 27%, has been completely wiped out by the staggering 50% <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/si" rel="nofollow">drop</a> it&#8217;s currently witnessing in the U.S. stock market today.</p>

Right!</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Finding the best undervalued <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> may need substantial research and be challenging. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes all you need is common sense, smart judgement, or long-term vision (as well as a little bit of help).</p>
<p style="color: #252525">So let&#8217;s go deep to uncover crypto assets that are undervalued owing to market conditions and other variables and have the potential to give huge returns in the next bull run.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Look at this list with a long-term perspective. Remember, these assets are not a get-rich-quick scheme. It takes time for ecosystems to grow and go mainstream, and they come with certain risks (you have been warned).</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">1. Chain (XCN)</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Chain is a cloud <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> infrastructure that helps businesses build their financial services infrastructure from the ground up.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The Chain Protocol specifies how assets on a blockchain network are issued, transferred, and managed. It enables a single company or a collection of companies to run a network, permits many types of assets to coexist, and is compatible with other independent networks.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Organizations can use Chain&#8217;s infrastructure to establish and administer a blockchain network, or link to a growing list of other networks.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">With a market cap of $258 million, XCN is currently trading at $0.01202. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coincodex.com/crypto/chain-new/">Coincodex&#8217;s</a> technical analysis, <strong>XCN is undervalued at the moment</strong>. It can be give good returns in the long term, with Coincodex predicting its price to be between $ 0.144714 and $ 0.434572 by 2025 (3,381.57% rise in the best case scenario).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134358" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05195024/Chain-XCN.jpg" alt="Chain" width="939" height="614" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">2. Bitcoin Standard Hashrate (BTCST)</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">BTCST is a token backed by genuine Bitcoin mining power, with each token representing 0.1 TH/s of Bitcoin mining power at a 60 W/TH efficiency.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Its mission is to improve the liquidity and efficiency of the mining power markets. It will provide customers with access to mining rewards and hashpower of any scale at a minimal cost. Staking BTCST allows holders to receive daily Bitcoin contributions equal to the staked mining power.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Users can mine <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> using BTCST from within the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralised finance (DeFi)</a> ecosystem.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">BTCST is currently trading at $0.8505.

Facebook abandoned its digital currency project in 2021 in response to persistent pressure from political and regulatory authorities.</p>
<h2>Silvergate&#8217;s Crypto Ambitions</h2>
<p>Silvergate was Facebook&#8217;s first choice when choosing which company would issue the USD-based stablecoin. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a> warned Silvergate &amp; threatened to freeze the firm, which dealt an effective and fatal blow to Meta&#8217;s blockchain aspirations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/silvergate-stock-crashes-reports-decline-crypto-deposits/">Silvergate Stock Crashes Nearly 50% As Firm Struggles With Crypto Deposits</a></em></p>
<p>However, the failure of the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> triggered a run on Silvergate Capital Corp., which caused the bank to be forced to liquidate assets at a significant loss in order to cover the approximately $8.1 billion in withdrawals.</p>
<p>In a filing with the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a>, the firm was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the significant changes in the digital asset industry landscape, this charge reflects the company’s belief that the launch of a blockchain-based payment solution by the company is no longer imminent,</p></blockquote>
<p>Silvergate further stated that they would continue to investigate new avenues for extracting value from these technological assets. The crypto-friendly bank acquired the software assets from Facebook, now <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/meta/">Meta</a>, with the intention of initially launching the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> around the end of 2022.</p>
<h2>Silvergate&#8217;s Dismal Q4 Figures</h2>
<p>According to the bank&#8217;s early release of quarterly figures, cryptocurrency-related deposits dropped by 68% during the final quarter of 2022. In order to meet the withdrawals, the company liquidated the debt it held on its balance sheet. This also includes an impairment charge of $196 million relating to the buyout of Diem as well as the layoff of 200 employees at a total cost of $12 million in severance payments.</p>
<p>As things stand, the Silvergate (SI) stock is currently trading at a pre-market valuation of $13.20, which is a whopping -40% decline from its last traded value of $21.95.</p>

Trader Joe is a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi trading platform</a> based on Avalanche. This comes as following the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/">trend of decentralized</a> protocols deploying to multiple chains.</p>
<p>Trader Joe has the highest total trading volume on Avalanche. The company released a statement in which it said the trading volume is decreasing drastically since the month of June, last year. The firm claimed that Joepeg has over 34,000 users and helped over 9.5 million USD transactions in secondary sales. It also noted investors will be able to trade coins using Liquidity Book. Hence, now the users on BNB chain can collect their NFTs through Joepeg’s NFT Marketplace.</p>
<p>Alvin Kan, the director of growth and ops, BNB chain added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe the efficiency and security of BNB Chain, combined with the user-friendly offerings of the Trader Joe DEX and Joepegs NFT Marketplace, will drive growth and success for the wider NFT and DeFi ecosystem,&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Expansion of Trader Joe on Ethereum chain</h2>
<p>In the month of December 2022, Trader Joe also expanded itself on Arbitrum. Arbitrum is a scaling platform for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. This was the first step from Trader Joe towards expansion since its launch in 2021. The company then said that main focus will be on development of Avalanche but it wants to expand to the global market by getting on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>We have seen several <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralized finance</a> protocols expanding itself on various platforms. For example- Uniswap and Aave, who have gradually deployed on various chains.</p>

<h2>Launch of Liquidity Book</h2>
<p>Last year itself, Trader Joe came up with the version 2 of Automated Market Maker, named the Liquidity Book. It improves the efficiency of liquidity suppliers by enabling them to earn trading commissions within a defined price range, whereas in a standard AMM the liquidity offered by users is divided evenly throughout price ranges from 0 to infinity.</p>

Crypto companies face increased scrutiny following the collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> and the overall decline in trading volumes in the crypto market. COIN price fell 6% in pre-market trading hours, with the current price trading near the $35 level.</p>
<h2>Cowen Downgrades Coinbase (COIN) Stock</h2>
<p>Cowen downgrades Coinbase stock (COIN) from &#8220;Outperform&#8221; to &#8220;Market Perform&#8221; rating despite investors hoping for a recovery in the crypto market.</p>
<p>Cowen&#8217;s analysts Stephen Glagola and George Kuhle believe the collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>&#8216;s crypto exchange FTX has led to increased scrutiny from the regulators U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;COIN&#8217;s monthly trading volumes have seen a fairly consistent drawdown each subsequent month since November 2021, and there remains low visibility into either a stabilization or rebound in retail trading volumes over 2023 given the macro backdrop and FTX contagion risks on crypto asset prices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The analysts also its COIN price target to $36 from $75. Coinbase shares fell nearly 84% in 2022, from $232 a year ago to $37.70 at Wednesday&#8217;s close. At the time of writing, the COIN price is trading at $35.12, down 6% in pre-market trading hours.</p>
<p>In December, Mizhuo also downgraded Coinbase to &#8220;underperform&#8221; and said the COIN stock could drop 30%. The fall in revenue due to the continuous downfall in crypto prices and the FTX crisis were the main reasons behind the downgrade.</p>
<h2>Can Crypto Market Recover Amid Increased Scrutiny?</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Coinbase also has to <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-to-pay-100-mn-fine-in-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay a $50 million fine</a> to the New York State Department of Financial Services for allowing consumers to register accounts without background checks. Also, the exchange will invest $50 million to strengthen its compliance program.</p>
<p>However, experts remain hopeful about the crypto market recovery in 2023. <a href="https://coingape.com/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-coinbase-tesla-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood</a> has been purchasing Coinbase shares as she believes a turn of events in 2023.

As companies declared bankruptcy, there was a lot of upheaval in the market. Despite the market breakdown and repeated attacks on the sector, especially from legacy media and regulators, there were a few developments that went under the radar.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the events that accelerated <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> adoption worldwide.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The world population crossed the 8 billion mark in 2022. With this, the number of crypto users worldwide also reached new highs.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">According to Singapore-based blockchain company <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/#:~:text=Global%20crypto%20adoption&amp;text=As%20of%202022%2C%20we%20estimated,320%20million%20crypto%20users%20worldwide">TripleA</a>, the global crypto ownership rate is approximately 4.2% as of 2022, with over 320 million crypto users globally.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">According to market research company <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-global-overview-report">GWI</a>, up to 10.2% of global internet users aged 16 to 64 hold cryptocurrencies. The majority of these holders live in countries suffering from high inflation or volatility in the value of their fiat currency.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Honduras</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">In 2022, the Próspera region of Honduras announced that<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/"> bitcoin</a> would be considered legal tender there. A legal framework has also been established to allow for the issue of bitcoin bonds.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">UK</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">The British Web3 community rejoiced in 2022 when the High Court of Justice in London declared that <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">nonfungible tokens (NFT)</a> are &#8220;private property.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The Financial Services and Markets Bill, which was introduced in July 2022, broadened regulations for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/stablecoins-2/">stablecoins</a> and gave them a new term: Digital Settlement Assets (DSA).</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The measure will provide the Treasury with the authority to regulate DSAs, including payments, service providers, and insolvency procedures.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, introduced in 2022, suggested &#8220;developing authorities to more swiftly and easily seize and recover crypto assets&#8221; in order to help people targeted by ransomware attacks.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">Brazil&#8217;s Regulatory Framework</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Brazil established its own regulatory framework in 2022. Brazil&#8217;s former president, Jair Bolsonaro, approved legislation authorising the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method within the country.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The legislation does not make cryptocurrencies legal tender; however, it provides a legal definition of digital currencies and a licencing framework for virtual asset service providers.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">In August 2022, the country&#8217;s tax authorities reported 12,053 distinct entities having cryptocurrency on their balance sheets. The Central Bank of Brazil is planning to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) by 2024.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">United Arab Emirates</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">In 2022, Dubai adopted a legislative framework for cryptocurrency with the goal of safeguarding investors and creating much-needed worldwide standards for industry governance. Dubai also announced the Dubai Metaverse Strategy. The strategy calls for collaborations in research and development (R&amp;D) by attracting companies and projects from around the world. It also launched Sharjahverse, a metaverse city.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Abu Dhabi issued preliminary proposals regarding NFT trading. They designated NFTs as intellectual property rather than investments or financial instruments, and they authorised the operation of NFT markets through multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and Virtual Asset Custodians (VACs).</p>

There were major collapses, the last being the implosion of once leading exchange FTX. This was followed by the arrest of a crypto billionaire, Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>The market has been sluggish since then and is finding it hard to recover. It can also be due to the tough economic situations surrounding the world. However, there are certain cryptocurrencies to watch out in 2023. These cryptos are considered to be of extraordinary potential, specifically this year.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer: This is just a prediction or an analysis. It nowhere guarantees that investing in theses tokens will give great returns. Invest at your own risk.</strong></em></p>
<p>We have analysed and listed such coins in this article.</p>
<h2>The 3 Crypto tokens to possibly implode in 2023 are:</h2>
<h3>Binance Coin (BNB)</h3>
<p>BNB is the native token of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a>. The crypto is planning to join Twitter with 500 million USD because of the hype around it. This is a strong reason for the token to boost in 2023.</p>
<p>BNB was launched in 2017 and has been growing exponentially all these years. Even in 2022 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/">bear market</a>, the token performed extremely well. However, recently Binance has been <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/">facing FUD</a>, which <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/changpeng-zhao/">CZ, the founder</a>, claims to be because of external factors.</p>
<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/mumbai-indians-seeks-proposals-to-build-nft-solutions/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">Mumbai Indians Seeks Proposals To Build NFT Solutions</a></p>
<h3>Ripple (XRP)</h3>
<p>Ripple is one of the most advanced <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>s in the world and it facilitates trade of both <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fiat-money/">fiat money</a> and other cryptos.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec-vs-ripple/">Ripple is currently facing a lawsuit against SEC</a>. If Ripple wins this there are high chances of it growing in 2023. January 30th might mark as an important day according to reports.</p>
<h3>Cardano (ADA)</h3>
<p>After <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/">Cardano</a> comes on the list of largest smart contract platform for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/">DApps</a>. It is considered as a safe crypto for long-term investments. Cardano has been making slow but gradual progress and doesn’t generally remain in hype for claims or remarks.</p>
<p>This coin is to watch out in 2023.</p>

The total crypto market volume decreased by <span class="sc-f1e838b2-0 dRLonq">2.08% </span>over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices hold near the $16.8K and $1,250 levels, respectively.</p>
<p>Will the hawkish <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a>&#8216;s restrictive interest rate hike to curb inflation in the coming months impact the anticipated Bitcoin and Ethereum bullish rally in 2023?</p>
<h2>Highlights From the FOMC Minutes</h2>
<p>Key points from the minutes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s December FOMC meeting released on January 4 paint an interesting picture for the crypto market in 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision to step down to a 50 bps hike after four consecutive 75 bps rate hikes do not indicate slowing inflation.</li>
<li>Strong commitment to continue rate hikes in 2023 as the FOMC “would continue to make decisions meeting by meeting” and returning inflation to the 2% target.</li>
<li>Restrictive monetary policy stance is expected to lift the unemployment rate to 4.6% by the end of the year and the fight to reduce prices will continue.</li>
<li>Fed staff suggests considering the possibility of a recession in 2023 for continuing restrictive rate hikes.</li>
<li>Fed warns financial markets not to underestimate the central bank&#8217;s bringing down inflation as an effort to restore price stability</li>
</ul>
<p>The CME FedWatch Tool <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicates</a> a 64.2% possibility of a 25 bps rate hike and a 35.8% possibility of a 50 bps hike in February. The possibility of a 50 bps rate hike increased after the FOMC minutes release.</p>
<p>Moreover, the U.S. dollar index (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DXY</a>) remained above the 104 level on Thursday. The futures tied to stock market indexes trade marginally higher as FOMC minutes induced mixed reactions in the markets.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Ethereum Price in 2023</h2>
<p>Wall Street banks anticipate a Fed pivot in 2023 as the central bank wants to continue interest rate hikes this year. Experts predicted the change in the monetary and economic policy cycles in mid-2023.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is currently trading near the $16.8K level, above the 50-EMA at $16,714. The BTC price will show low volatility due to the Bollinger Band Squeeze. After the FOMC minutes release, the trading volume dived lower. Thus, it indicates that the price will continue to make range movement.</p>
<p>Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1610730409662218246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicts</a> Bitcoin is poised to run up to $17K before the next FOMC rate hike decision on February 1. However, the BTC price could witness a correction after the meeting. People looking for longs could go around $16.5-16.6K.</p>

Source: Michael van de Poppe</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Ethereum price can also have a better upside move before a correction near the FOMC meeting. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,252, moving sideways with low trading volume.</p>
<p>The recent price jump in ETH is due to the <a href="https://coingape.com/eth-up-5-as-ethereum-whales-turn-active-once-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed whale activity</a> in Ethereum. In the last 24 hours, over 600 ETH transactions worth more than $100K have taken place on the Ethereum blockchain, as per Santiment.</p>
<p>Michael van de Poppe earlier suggested investors to go <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-price-prediction-analyst-suggest-best-level-buy-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long on Ethereum near $1,170</a> as it is the crucial support level for Ethereum.</p>

The comments came at the back of the flurry of withdrawals from the bank when the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a> unfolded in November 2022. The bank said its mission in the digital assets industry has not changed. In an early sneak peak of the company&#8217;s fourth quarter results, it said there was huge drop in crypto related deposits.</p>

<h2>Crypto Deposits Plunge</h2>
<p>In the last quarter, deposits associated with cryptocurrencies dropped by a whopping 68%, the bank said. According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silvergate-raced-to-cover-8-1-billion-in-withdrawals-during-crypto-meltdown-11672895207" rel="nofollow">Wall Street Journal</a> report, Silvergate has more cash in hand than the remaining deposits. However, there was a spike in daily average volume at the bank. The bank had $4.60 billion in cash while it had deposits worth $3.80 billion during the quarter. A statement from the bank said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While Silvergate is taking decisive action to navigate the current environment, its mission has not changed. Silvergate believes in the digital asset industry.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There was fear and uncertainty around Silvergate&#8217;s stability after crypto lender <a href="https://coingape.com/silvergate-blockfi-exposure-stock-price-shows-more-fud-ahead/">BlockFi filed for bankruptcy</a> following FTX meltdown. With news of exposure to the lending company, Silvergate stock price went down after the bankruptcy announcement. At the time, the bank said it had minimal exposure to BlockFi.

<p style="color: #252525">Due to its versatile and robust mechanism, as well as a vibrant Ethereum community, ERC-20 tokens gained popularity and saw quick adoption. For those who don&#8217;t know, ERC-20 enables tokens to be used across the Ethereum ecosystem, such as in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi</a> projects,<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/"> dApps</a>, etc.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s look at some of the top Ethereum tokens that might roar in the next bull run.</h3>
<h3 style="color: #252525">BNB</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">BNB, the native currency of the BNB Chain ecosystem, is considered the most popular utility token. It is used to pay for goods and services, settle transaction fees on Binance Smart Chain, participate in exclusive token sales, and so on. BNB has become quite popular due to its auto-burn mechanism.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">With a market cap of $41 billion, it is currently trading at $256.45. BNB has been seeing a downward trend for quite some time. Its price has declined by 11.01% in the last 30 days, by 27.54% in the last 60 days, and by 10.00% in the last 90 days. BNB is $434.42 down from its ATH of $690.93.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Since the crypto market is in a dip right now and so is BNB, it could give a good ROI in the next bull run. According to Coincodex, the BNB price would be between $ 477.95 and $ 1,435.26 by 2025.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">MATIC is used to manage, secure, and pay for network transaction fees on the Polygon network. With a market cap of $6.9 billion, MATIC has also been experiencing a downward trend for quite some time. It is currently trading at $0.8004 and is down by 11.82% in the last 30 days, by 31.13% in the last 60 days, and by 5.48% in the last 90 days.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">Since MATIC is in a dip despite offering the same value proposition as it did in the bull market of 2021, it can reach new highs in the next bull.<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coincodex.com/crypto/matic-network/price-prediction/"> Coincodex</a> predicts that  MATIC price would be between $ 1.496618 and $ 4.49 by 2025, and may hit $ 22.12 by 2027.</p>
