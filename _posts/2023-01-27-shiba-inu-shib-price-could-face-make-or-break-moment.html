title: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Face Make Or Break Moment
tag: NewsBTC
---

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price could be facing a make-or-break moment in the coming weeks. While the launch of Shibarium is imminent according to the chief developer, the success of the layer-2 blockchain and the emerging ecosystem could determine how the SHIB price will perform. Despite the 43% year-to-date (YTD) price increase, SHIB is still in bearish territory. Ultimately, SHIB needs another boost, whether from a macro perspective or from the successful launch of Shibarium, to return to the bullish ground. The 1-day chart reveals that SHIB is still writing low highs on a daily basis since August last year. However, the year-to-date rally could be the start of a major move to the upside. For now, SHIB has seen a retest of the support zone at $0.000011, but could now push ahead with its rise. If not, there could be more downsides for SHIB.

If the price manages to stay above this level, the first target could be the January 18 high of $0.00001292, in order to write a new local high. After that, there would be a possibility of SHIB making a new attempt to break the high of $0.00001519 from October 29. Achieving success could mean a return to the bullish territory. However, the final, biggest hurdle, for now, will be the resistance zone between $0.00001691 and $0.00001799. Shibarium And Whales In The Spotlight For Shiba Inu A look at the fundamentals also reveals a make-or-break moment. With the much-hyped launch of Shibarium, it remains to be seen whether Shiba Inu can grow beyond its meme coin status. The project is a layer 2 solution for the Ethereum-based network and aims to lay the foundation for building a powerful ecosystem that hosts a metaverse, a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain-based games, and NFTs. The decentralized exchange Shiba SwapDEX launched back in July 2021 and reached a TVL of $1.66 billion at the time, but is down to $30 million. Shibarium could give new life to the exchange.

If the fundamentals are right, the price will follow. If Shibarium is a disappointment, the SHIB price could see further downside. Meanwhile, the popularity of SHIB among Ethereum whales points to a bullish sentiment. A SHIB community member shared data from WhaleStats, according to which SHIB is the top-held non-stablecoin by Ethereum whales. SHIB accounts for 15.76%, only outpaced by USDT (19.52%).
