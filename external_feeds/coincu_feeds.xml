<p>On Thursday, <strong>Judge J Travis Laster, of the Delaware Court of Chancery, ruled in favour of Compass Mining and entered a default judgment against Dynamics for $1,474,400, plus post-judgment interest and costs.</strong></p>



<p>Because Dynamics&#8217; attorneys withdrew from the lawsuit for non-payment, according to a <a href="https://compassmining.io/education/compass-mining-wins-against-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, <strong>Compass is unclear whether it will be able to recover that money.</strong></p>



<p>When Dynamics announced that it had terminated a hosting deal with Compass and charged the company with missing and late payments in June, the dispute between the two businesses intensified. <strong>The decision comes at a challenging moment for miners who must contend with rising energy bills, low bitcoin prices, and growing mining difficulty.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/148289-compass-mining-launches-protection-plan/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/148289-compass-mining-launches-protection-plan/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compass </a>launched a lawsuit on the grounds that Dynamics was hostage-taking its equipment and claimed that the accusations were totally false. Additionally, the firm said that while <strong>it had contributed roughly $1.7 million to the development and maintenance of three buildings, Dynamics had failed to meet some of its duties.</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2378.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="300" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2378.png" alt="Compass Mining Wins $1.5 Million In Court Ruling Against Dynamics" class="wp-image-156985" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2378.png 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2378-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2378-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Compass Mining Wins $1.5 Million In Court Ruling Against Dynamics 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On July 6, 2022, the Court granted Compass immediate injunctive relief, granting Compass access to a Dynamics facility where Compass customer miners were being housed, <strong>allowing Compass to collect that equipment.</strong></p>



<p>The payments outlined in <strong>the application for default judgment account for overbilled and unreimbursed sums</strong>, as well as <strong>deposits</strong> and <strong>capital expenditures made by Compass for the development of various facilities</strong>. Dynamics was also ordered to pay post-judgment interest and collection expenses to the court.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">We’re glad to see the correct ruling play out, Dynamics Mining violated the rights of both Compass Mining and our clients, and we’re thankful the US legal system has produced a just result.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/italys-parliament-gives-final-approval-governments-2023-budget-2022-12-29/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/italys-parliament-gives-final-approval-governments-2023-budget-2022-12-29/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>, <strong>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni</strong>&#8216;s 2023 expansionary budget, which was produced in a haste at the end of the year<strong>, includes 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax incentives to help firms and people dealing with the energy crisis</strong>.</p>



<p>Coindesk reported that in Italy, where crypto is mostly unregulated, <strong>the 387-page budget defines crypto assets as a digital representation of value or rights that may be exchanged and held electronically</strong>, using distributed ledger or comparable technologies.</p>

<p><strong>The move by Italy to impose a capital-gains tax on cryptocurrency comes ahead of the European Union&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation</strong>, which promises to license frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member bloc.</p>



<p>Gains from cryptocurrency trading are taxed at 26% if they surpass 2,000 euros every tax period. As an incentive for registering cryptocurrency gains, the proposed measure imposes <strong>a substitute income tax of 14% on the value of assets held as of January 1, 2023</strong>, rather than the cost at the time of acquisition.</p>

<p>Losses from crypto investments can now be subtracted from gains and carried forward, according to the new laws.</p>



<p>Investors, on the other hand, may want some extra clarification on what constitutes a taxable event, as the paper also states that the <strong>exchange of crypto assets with the same features and functionalities does not constitute a fiscal case</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition to the <strong>BUSD</strong> issued by <strong>Paxos</strong> on the <strong>Ethereum</strong> <strong>blockchain</strong>, the <strong>Binance-Peg BUSD</strong>, which is <strong>a wrapped version of BUSD offered by Binance</strong>, expands the supported blockchain networks to include <strong>TRON</strong>. As a result of this development, users will now be able to send BUSD and Binance-Peg BUSD across the <strong>TRON</strong> <strong>network</strong>.</p>



<p>Wrapping tokens is blockchain lingo for creating versions of the original asset that are transportable to other chains for the sake of increasing interoperability and the interconnectedness of the digital asset space. Normally, the value of wrapped tokens is secured by locking the collateral of the original asset, which is the case with <strong>Binance-Peg BUSD.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Binance</strong> autonomously creates <strong>Binance-Peg BUSD</strong> and pegs the tokens to <strong>BUSD</strong> in a <strong>1:1 ratio</strong>, along with other blockchains like <strong>BNB Chain, Polygon</strong>, and <strong>Avalanche</strong>. In addition to the <strong>BNB Chain </strong>network, <strong>Binance-Peg BUSD</strong> can also be exchanged on the <strong>TRON, Ethereum, Avalanche</strong>, and <strong>Polygon networks.</strong></p>



<p>The Paxos-issued BUSD stablecoin is under the inspection and regulation of the US government.</p>



<p>This integration will help <strong>BUSD</strong> expand its circulation on blockchains and compete with its rival, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/148610-tether-founder-claims-usdt-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDT</a>.</p>



<p><strong>USDT</strong>, the stablecoin issued by Tether, is still in its dominant position with the integration of<strong> 11 DeFi ecosystems</strong> and multiple blockchains, including <strong>TRON</strong>.</p>

<li><em>Claims that Defrost Finance canceled the project after $12 million was stolen from the smart contract last week have been refuted by the company.</em></li>

<li><em>Defrost Finance has also carefully planned to be able to refund users. The team also publishes information related to the exploit and constantly updates it, unlike some other platforms that just stay silent after such incidents take place.</em></li>

<p>This week, the blockchain security company <strong>DeFiYieldSec</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/@DeFiYieldSec/exclusive-the-defrost-team-rugpulled-12m-7m-999b24c13f47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that the alleged exploit was an inside job.

<p>According to a Defrost Finance spokesman who <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/30/defrost-finance-denies-rug-pull-allegations-amid-12m-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked</a> to <em>CoinDesk</em>, the first of two attacks used a <strong>&#8220;flash-loan re-entrancy&#8221;</strong> exploit to target the<strong> V2 contract.</strong></p>



<p>The second, much more significant attack took place on <strong>Christmas Eve</strong>, according to the spokesman. This time, the hacker or hackers were successful in stealing the private key, using it to add a false collateral token and price oracle before printing <strong>100 million H20 tokens</strong>. The hacker then used the existing vaults&#8217; oracles to his advantage to drain money from them.</p>

<p>On December 25, Defrost Finance said that both of its versions, Defrost v1 and Defrost v2, are under investigation for hacking. In particular, the Defrost team claimed in a tweet thread published that <strong>a first assault utilized a flash loan to siphon money from its V2 product</strong>. <strong>A second larger attack used the owner key to exploit V1</strong>. The leveraged trade protocol on the Avalanche blockchain didn&#8217;t specify how much money had been stolen.</p>



<p>After the incident, a lot of accusations were made that this was a <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);"><b>rug-</b></span><strong>pull</strong> scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Wietse Wind</strong>, the creator of the XRP Ledger, cautioned on Twitter of a <strong>new Ripple scam</strong>. He emphasized that the corporation is not conducting any air drops, events, or freebies. Wind displayed a screenshot of <strong>a user fraudulently bidding XRP</strong>. &#8220;As the new year approaches, we have decided to reinstate XRP AirDrop. XRP for all <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155849-ripple-ally-requests-modest-civil-penalty/">Ripple </a>users,&#8221; the bogus article says. The post will alert users on Ripple Scam and be aware of any related cases.</p>

<p>On Twitter, <strong>Gillian Keegan</strong>, a British politician who serves as Secretary of State for Education, was also <strong>the target</strong> of a platform hack <strong>on December 26</strong>. His account began tweeting about cryptocurrencies and then moved to the profile of entrepreneur Elon Musk.</p>



<p>The tweets were about a phony event purportedly arranged by Musk&#8217;s businesses (Twitter and Tesla). It was offering a &#8220;<strong>special gift to all our followers and the crypto community</strong>&#8220;. Free Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum were promised to users (ETH).</p>

<p>Previously, <strong>Nicole Tatz</strong>, an attorney for <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152903-ripple-attorney-withdraws-the-lawsuit/">Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse</a>, filed a Motion to Withdraw as Counsel in the continuing Ripple litigation <strong>on December 17</strong>. She is also leaving the law firm <strong>Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton LLP</strong>, which is representing the Ripple CEO in the ongoing dispute. In the meantime, the other parties are still involved in the lawsuit.</p>



<p>Since the last submission in the matter was already made, <strong>the petitions for summary judgment</strong> are now completely stated. According to James K. Filan&#8217;s prediction, Ripple is asking the judge to rule in its favor, and the verdict is expected<strong> in early 2023.</strong></p>

<p>The more recent trades <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/0xf02e86d9e0efd57ad034faf52201b79917fe0713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happened</a> after crypto wallets connected to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156191-ftx-and-alameda-related-wallets-active/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alameda Research</a>, the trading division of the cryptocurrency exchange <strong>FTX</strong>, started trading again on <strong>Wednesday</strong> for the first time since <strong>December 1.</strong></p>



<p>A large portion of the assets involved in the initial round of transactions has been transferred to two new wallet addresses that belong to unknown individuals.</p>



<p>On <strong>Wednesday</strong>, Alameda-linked wallets used crypto mixers and quick exchanges to convert several crypto tokens to <strong>ETH</strong>, <strong>USDT</strong>, and eventually to <strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</p>



<p>Then, some of the money was transferred to <strong>FixedFloat</strong> and <strong>ChangeNow</strong>, two <strong>decentralized exchanges (DEX)</strong> and <strong>decentralized peer-to-peer finance (DeFi) </strong>marketplaces where smart contracts make transactions possible. These two services don&#8217;t require user registration and advertise themselves as rapid and private swaps.</p>

<p>According to the crypto intelligence company <strong>Arkham</strong>, some of the platforms that accepted Alameda payments were cryptocurrency mixers like <strong>Tornado Cash</strong>, which are more well-liked by hackers.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Together, the two wallets received more than<strong> $1.6 million</strong>, half of which came from wallets connected to Alameda, while<strong> the remaining funds came from unidentified accounts.</strong></p>



<p>A <strong>Fixedfloat</strong> representative disputed that the business is a crypto mixer. After blocking listing the questionable wallets, <strong>ChangeNow</strong> <a href="https://changenow.io/blog/changenow-stands-against-fraudulent-actions-ensures-high-compliance-standards-amid-alameda-wallets-suspicious-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> in a statement on <strong>Thursday</strong> that their compliance team is collaborating with investigations.</p>



<p>According to several cryptocurrency Twitter users, using the two DeFi platforms makes it improbable that <strong>these transactions were carried out by authorized liquidators.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Key Points:</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li><em>Since 2022, Solana has lost approximately $50 billion in value due to outages, overloads, and exposure to Sam Bankman-FTX Fried&#8217;s exchange.</em></li>



<li><em>Solana proponents say the decentralized finance platform is more important than ever, but recent price behavior reveals investors remain cautious even after crypto markets calmed.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Solana was billed as the cryptocurrency that will take on ether with a more environmentally friendly approach, better transaction speeds, and more constant pricing.</strong></h5>

<p>Investors that took the risk had a bad year. The token&#8217;s market cap <strong>fell from more over $55 billion in January</strong> to just over<strong> $3 billion by the end of the year</strong>. Solana&#8217;s strong association with <strong>FTX founder </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/151821-bankman-fried-accused-8-counts-fraud/"><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong></a>, who faces eight criminal fraud charges after his crypto exchange went bankrupt last month, was one of the company&#8217;s main concerns in late 2022. The disgraced former crypto billionaire was one of Solana&#8217;s most vocal supporters, promoting the benefits of blockchain technology and investing more than<strong> $500 million in this coins</strong>.</p>



<p>When FTX failed, investors abandoned $SOL to the tune of<strong> $8 billion.</strong> But, while the rest of the crypto industry has been pretty calm and values have been constant, this token price has fallen much worse. $SOL has <strong>dropped by more than 30%</strong> in the last week. <strong>Ether</strong> has remained stable, losing <strong>1.7%</strong> in the same time span, while <strong>bitcoin</strong> has lost <strong>1.2%</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>$SOL fell <strong>5.8%</strong> in one hour of trade on Thursday, putting it to its lowest level <strong>since early 2021</strong>. The price has since recovered from its lows, with a market cap that now <strong>exceeds $3.5 billion</strong>. Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by more than <strong>200%</strong> in comparison.</p>



<p>Over the course <strong>of 2021</strong>, Solana skyrocketed, with a single token<strong> rising 12,000%</strong> for the year and reaching <strong>$250 by November</strong>. Even before the demise of FTX, Solana faced a number of public battles that called into question the protocol&#8217;s claim to be a superior technology.</p>



<p>Solana lost more than <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156409-solana-falls-under-10-for-the-first-time/"><strong>70% of its value</strong></a><strong> </strong>in the weeks following FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy declaration in November. Investors abandoned anything affiliated with Bankman-Fried, with FTT (FTX&#8217;s native token), Solana, and Serum prices plummeting precipitously.</p>

<p>The NFT marketplace said that as of <strong>January 2 </strong>at <strong>3 p.m. EST</strong>, it will impose a <strong>0.5% minimum royalty on NFT collections that are unable to use the filter registry</strong>, a method for enforcing royalties. The minimum will rise gradually as it sees how each increment affects things (0.5% to start, then 1%, 1.5%, 2%, etc.).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In light of this, Blur will start by enforcing a minimum royalty of 0.5% on immutable collections. We will increase the minimum over time as we observe the effects of each increase (0.5% to start, then 1%, 1.5%, 2%, etc).</p>&mdash; Blur (@blur_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1608580781915648000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/150934-the-nft-market-blurs-skyrocketed-by-345-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blur</a> will continue to enforce full royalties on collections that make use of the filter registry. It will price match as the minimal royalty increases. Price matching will take effect on those collections until the lower royalty marketplace increases its royalties if it exceeds a significant threshold of market share on a per-collection basis.</p>



<p>The project goal was to design an effective policy that could solve the following realities:</p>



<ul>
<li>On-chain royalties and filters are circumventable.</li>



<li>Markets gravitate toward efficiency.</li>



<li>New marketplaces can view royalty circumvention as a growth tactic.</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, when the token releases in <strong>January</strong>, developers will also get a sizable <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154407-blur-extended-period-its-airdrop-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLUR airdrop</a>. Creators of collections that are traded on the NFT marketplace will be eligible for the airdrop.</p>

<p>It should be noted that <strong>Blur will keep enforcing full royalties on collections that make use of the filter registry and whitelist</strong>. For existing/immutable collections that are unable to use the filter registry, this new policy is available.</p>



<p>The platform will continue to charge<strong> 0% marketplace fees</strong> to clear up any misunderstandings. Only creator royalties on unchangeable/existing collections are affected by this change.</p>
