Why Google Bard Predicts a Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rally
<p class="s5">Over the last eight weeks, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been steadily increasing, finally reclaiming the $0.00001000 support last week. Google Bard has predicted that the rally for the Shiba Inu coin will continue, citing three major reasons.</p>
<p class="s5">The first reason according to Bard is the launch of Shibarium. The layer 2 network is set to launch this week and add more utility to Shiba Inu. Next, Google Bard highlights the increasing Shiba Inu burn. By reducing the number of SHIB, it predicts an increase in the Shiba Inu price.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, SHIB is approaching a golden cross after printing six consecutive weeks of bullish candles. If this holds up, Google Bard has predicted that the price of Shiba Inu could rally by 50% and trade as high as $0.00001510.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an ApeCoin (APE) Rally
<p class="s5">The AI chatbot has highlighted several reasons why the ApeCoin price could increase in the coming days. According to the AI chatbot, ApeCoin (APE) first is part of the biggest non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, ensuring its success.</p>
<p class="s5">Also, the ecosystem is about to witness a significant expansion, which could also help the Apecoin value increase. Lastly, APE has been decoupling from the price of Bitcoin, which hints at a major price outbreak.</p>
<p class="s5">At the time of this writing, the price of Apecoin stands at $2.01. With the current projections, ApeCoin could reach highs of $2.5 by the end of August.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an Everlodge (ELDG) Rally
<p class="s5">Everlodge (ELDG) is another project that has attracted strong bullish predictions from Google Bard. The project is disrupting the timeshare sector by introducing a hybrid property co-ownership model, allowing millions of new investors to participate with as little as $100.</p>
<p class="s5">Google Bard is bullish about Everlodge as the project debuts as a one-of-a-kind initiative in the $280 trillion global real estate industry. Also, the project&rsquo;s partnerships with well-known hotel brands and luxury real estate developers would drive the price higher.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, Everlodge's growth will be ensured by the project's broad ecosystem and customer-friendly benefits. At the time of this writing, Everlodge is in its beta presale stage and sells for $0.01.</p>
<p class="s5">Based on Google Bard&rsquo;s predictions, investors can expect a 20x price surge for Everloge in 2023 as the token has been given a yearly high of $0.20 per token.</p>
