Over the last week, the XRP token has dominated the headlines following Ripple’s partial court victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  On July 13, Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP doesn&#8217;t qualify as a security leading to a massive price surge in which the token gained by almost 90%. However, while it may appear that XRP&#8217;s positive effect on the market is waning, with most assets slipping into a bearish state, there is still a high level of interest surrounding this altcoin, proven by a recent report from prominent crypto exchange Bitrue. Bitrue Users Accumulate $800M Worth Of XRP In Futures Market.  In the late hours of yesterday, a crypto analyst with the Twitter handle @cowboycrypto313 revealed that Bitrue had shared a report via email with its users, noting a massive increase in the notional value of the open interest of the XRP token.

In this context, it represents the total value of XRP on the Bitrue exchange based on what its traders have pledged to buy or sell in the future.  In this report, Bitrue states that XRP holdings in its Futures service spiked from less than $200 million to over $800 million during the weekend. Interestingly, the exchange further revealed that 88% of its users are holding a long position on this asset. According to a chart shared by Bitrue, the notional value of open interest for XRP on its platform had been below $200 million for the majority of the last two weeks. However, following the court ruling on July 13, this index started rising, with the XRP Futures market recording a notable spike on July 16.  Source: Twitter XRP Soars By 57% In Seven Days In other news, XRP remains the center of the crypto market attention, recording a 56.73% gain in the last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
