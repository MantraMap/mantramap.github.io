<p>The crypto market can be unpredictable. Regardless, investors are still on the lookout for new promising coins. Uwerx is one such cryptocurrency that has generated buzz in recent weeks as its presale keeps blowing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is currently on the verge of selling out its third presale phase. The interest that Uwerx is generating is attributed mainly to its features and uses. In this article, we'll examine the features of Uwerx and why it's gaining momentum over Avalanche (AVAX) and Polygon (MATIC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX): Providing Effective DeFi Solutions</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the fastest blockchain networks with robust capabilities. Some of its features include built-in support for decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, compatibility with other blockchains, and smart contract functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) currently trades at $14.84 with a trading volume of $109,659,557. Analysts predict a favorable price increase by Q4 2023 up to $25 as Avalanche (AVAX) has drawn the attention of investors and traders due to its technical prowess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though Avalanche (AVAX) tends to continue making waves in the blockchain industry, Uwerx is likely to surpass it by more than 6,000%thanks to its combination of security, utility, and strong market appeal.</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC): Experience one of the Largest Blockchain Scaling Technology&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is one of the most widely adopted cryptocurrency platforms. Companies like Disney and Starbucks are just a few of the well-known companies that have acknowledged the value that Polygon (MATIC) offers.</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) sells for $0.83, and analysts predict it&rsquo;ll reach $1.25 by Q3 2024 as its popularity and adoption grows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As fascinating as it sounds, the outlook is far from that of Uwerx. Its current presale feats have made this quite vivid, as its first and second phases sold out within 17 and 8 days after launching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): Bringing a New Dimension to the Gig Economy&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gig industry is about to experience the biggest revolution ever. Platforms like Upwork, Freelancers.com, and Toptal have led the freelancing sector for several years. These platforms have generated billions in revenue without addressing the concerns of freelancers and clients. With Uwerx, all of these will come to an end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is an upcoming freelancing platform based on the Polygon blockchain network. A significant advantage of Uwerx is that it'll utilize blockchain technology to provide users with the utmost transparency and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Uwerx will charge a substantially lower fee of 1% compared to the 20% fee charged by conventional platforms. There'll be several incentives and performance bonuses to win too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To erase doubts, Uwerx has passed audits by InterFi Network and SolidProof and is listed on CoinSniper. By August 1st, Uwerx will be listed on Uniswap. Also, the project's contract will be renounced when the taxes reduce to zero and just before Uwerx launches on centralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why Uwerx (WERX) Presale is Selling Out Fast</p>
<p>The WERX token presale is in the third phase, and many tokens have been sold out. Each WERX token is worth $0.012; a 20% bonus is available on every purchase. The presale price will increase to $0.0225 by the 10th of May at 18:00 UTC. In addition, WERX tokens will be placed on a liquidity lock for 25 years shortly after the presale ends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors who need a means of storing their tokens will have the Uwerx Vault at their disposal. The Uwerx Vault will function similarly to the staking mechanism, and investors can store their tokens for varying durations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The optimized five-token allocations have undergone modifications to help the project adjust to the market&rsquo;s volatility. The presale access will be granted to 57% of WERX's total supply, up from the previous 45%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors will be able to purchase additional tokens as a result of this adjustment. Also, the incentives for partnerships have also been decreased from 7.5% to 3% after the feedback from companies was analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the user performance incentive has been decreased from 15% to 6.5% in order to prevent long-term negative selling pressure. The joining incentive, which was originally 4.5%, has been increased to 6.5% in order to boost participation and activity. The marketing reserve and the liquidity reserve, however, both continue to be 10%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The token allocation for the stage four presale has been increased to 77.5 million tokens from the previous 60 million tokens. Also, a fifth presale phase has also been added, with 72.5 million tokens allocated to it. The hard-cap presale for Uwerx is anticipated to finish on July 31 as scheduled.</p>
<p>An alpha platform will be released during the third presale phase, and exciting features will be unveiled as the roadmap progresses. With over 3,500 users, the Uwerx platform is fast growing.&nbsp;</p>
