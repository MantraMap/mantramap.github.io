			            <description><![CDATA[Grayscale BTC Trust shares accounted for nearly 7.5% of total ARKW holdings in Q2 2023.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s ARK Invest revealed some interesting details on its portfolio in the second quarter of 2023. The latest report suggested that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) stood out as one of the top-performing assets within the investment firm&#8217;s portfolio.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to asset allocation, GBTC trailed behind Coinbase at ARKW.</p>
<h2>GBTC Tops Chart</h2>
<p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) played a crucial role as one of the top five contributors driving ARKW&#8217;s impressive growth of over 9%. Alongside other performers such as Tesla, Shopify, Unity Software, and DraftKings, GBTC secured the fifth position in this ranking.</p>
<p>Within ARKW&#8217;s portfolio, the trust accounted for 108 basis points, whereas Tesla, as the leading asset, represented 232 basis points, according to ARK’s latest quarterly ETF <a href="https://etfs.ark-funds.com/hubfs/2_Download_Files_For_ARK_Funds/Reports/ARK_ETF_Trust_Quarterly_Report.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=267007556&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87tkgpuq29CO0j-K7jrVWLqtUhYvB8gAIx3URjQhQNkmhsbzQTJnTGA5RFQkb4aS5zAikqcP9d4YUBpcV2cCEJeYvbEw&amp;utm_content=267007556&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a>.</p>
<p>ARKW has depicted impressive year-to-date gains of nearly 50%. In the second quarter, the leading ETF allocated roughly 20% of its assets to cloud computing and around 19% to blockchain as part of its strategy to capitalize on internet-based products and services, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and e-commerce sectors.</p>
<p>Besides, the GBTC has been trading at an increasingly widening discount to the value of the Bitcoin it holds for over two years. However, the discount has narrowed significantly in recent weeks, which, in turn, has rewarded investors. Such a trend could potentially signal increasing confidence in the trust or rising demand for shares.</p>
<h2>Top Assets by Allocation</h2>
<p>Coinbase emerged as the biggest allocated asset, amassing weightage of 8.7%. Trailing behind is Tesla accounting for 7.6%, and GBTC, with 7.4% in the second and third positions, respectively. Jack Dorsey-backed platform Block made it to the fourth position with 7%.</p>
<p>The quarterly report, however, does not include the July sales of Coinbase shares. Cathie Wood&#8217;s investment firm had accumulated a significant chunk of COIN during the bear market. As the price of COIN hit a yearly high, ARK resorted to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cathie-woods-ark-invest-offloads-over-88m-worth-coinbases-coin-shares-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">offloading</a> some of the shares to rake in profit. Over the last two weeks, the investment fund led by the Bitcoin Bull has sold over $88 million worth of COIN shares in tranches.</p>
<p>Despite the sales, ARK’s CEO Wood reiterated a bullish on Coinbase.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Only 8% think bitcoin will never tap its peak again.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A recent study conducted by CryptoVantage estimated that 23% of US residents expect bitcoin to climb to its all-time high price of almost $70,000 by the end of 2023. 47% think this would happen in the next five years.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The majority of respondents also believe the high inflation that has recently spread across the globe will make the cryptocurrency industry more attractive to investors. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Americans&#8217; Latest Thoughts on Crypto</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The survey, which questioned 1,000 US residents who had purchased some cryptocurrencies in the past, <a href="https://www.cryptovantage.com/future-of-crypto/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">showed</a> that 70% expect BTC to shoot back to approximately $70K in the next five years. In comparison, only 8% believe the leading digital asset will never climb to that level again.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_261513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261513" style="width: 832px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chart3.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261513" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chart3.png" alt="CryptoVantage" width="832" height="400" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chart3.png 1516w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chart3-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chart3-1024x492.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chart3-768x369.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chart3-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261513" class="wp-caption-text">BTC Future Price, Source: CryptoVantage</figcaption></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity behind the analysis highlighted the overall positive stance of the respondents on bitcoin&#8217;s future valuation, reminding that the next BTC halving is due in the spring of 2024.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Still, the fact that 78% of people in total believe that BTC will eventually set a new ATH is heartening, as is the fact that only 8% believe it will &#8220;never&#8221; equal or top $69,044. And in terms of what might help the cryptocurrency regain former levels, it should be noted that the next Bitcoin halving is due to take place by the end of April 2024.&#8221;<br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The event happens every four years and reduces the awards for miners in half, thus ensuring that the speed of production of new BTC slows down. It is worth mentioning that the price of the primary cryptocurrency has headed north following all previous halvings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The participants were also quite bullish on Ethereum (ETH), with 46% saying it has the best chance of surpassing bitcoin as the biggest crypto asset in the future. 20.8% expect Dogecoin (DOGE) to flip BTC, while 7.8% believe BNB could achieve that.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the same time, they expressed concerns that the infamous volatility in the market could negatively impact the prices of digital currencies. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inflation to Push People Toward Crypto</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most survey respondents think that &#8220;global financial trends,&#8221; such as the galloping inflation, rising interest rates, and the overall economic growth, could play a key role in the future valuation of cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recall that the US Federal Reserve adopted an aggressive interest rate hike strategy shortly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lifting the benchmark has reduced investor interest in risk-on assets, such as digital currencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regarding inflation, 54% of the participants believe it will trigger additional enthusiasm toward the crypto sector. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Argentina and Turkey are two examples where residents have embraced the asset class amid the severe monetary problems in their homelands. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <em>CryptoPotato</em> recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-hits-ath-against-egp-on-binance-amid-egypts-economic-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the high inflation and the devaluation of the Egyptian pound have caused some locals to seek alternative investment options like cryptocurrencies. The country&#8217;s official currency has depreciated so much that the price of BTC measured in EGP recently tapped an all-time high on exchanges like Binance and Changelly.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Someone leaked Caroline Ellison’s personal diary to the media. The US Government thinks it was Sam Bankman-Fried.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caroline Ellison – former CEO of the fallen crypto trading desk Alameda Research – felt “unhappy and overwhelmed” with her job, and strongly doubted that she was well suited to the role, according to newly leaked excerpts from her online diary.</p>
<p>The excerpts shed light on many of her inner thoughts heading preceding FTX’s demise, including her troubled relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).</p>
<h2>Boyfriend Pressure and Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> on Thursday, the 27-year-old crypto executive told SBF in an April 2022 writing that her previous breakup with SBF had “significantly decreased my excitement about Alameda,” due to the job’s association with the exchange founder.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried founded Alameda in 2017 and promoted Ellison to a co-CEO position in 2021, alongside Sam Trabucco. While Sam did not formally control Alameda’s operations, Ellison wrote in February 2022 that she had “an instinct to shrink and become smaller and quieter and defer to others” when he was around.</p>
<p>After one of the couple’s many breakups, Ellison deliberately ghosted Bankman-Fried. “Not giving you the contact you wanted felt like the only way I could regain a sense of power,” she wrote in April.</p>
<p>Ellison’s Alameda was one of the few trading desks that seemingly managed to survive the immediate aftermath of Terra (LUNA)’s collapse in May 2022, which took out rival hedge fund Three Arrow Capital.</p>
<p>However, as prosecutors now allege, FTX was responsible for keeping Alameda alive at the time using billions of customers’ deposits. FTX’s new CEO and bankruptcy lawyer <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/john-ray-says-reviving-ftx-is-on-the-table-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">John Ray</a> has confirmed that FTX and Alameda effectively shared a balance sheet.</p>
<p>Even in the April before Terra’s downfall, Ellison wrote about how doubtful she was of her own abilities, lacking in areas like “leadership” and “decisiveness.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Running Alameda doesn’t feel like something I’m that comparatively advantaged at or well suited to do,” she wrote.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Did SBF Leak Ellison’s Diary?</h2>
<p>Shortly after The New York Times published its article, the Justice Department accused SBF of being responsible for leaking Ellison’s diary to reporters.</p>
<p>The government requested that the court prevent Bankman-Fried from releasing any more non-public information that could potentially interfere with a fair trial.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Such an order is necessary because of a substantial likelihood that the defendant’s extrajudicial comments will undermine a fair trial by tainting the jury pool and chilling the testimony of prospective trial witnesses,” wrote the DOJ in a Thursday <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filing</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DOJ has already slapped Bankman-fried with over a dozen charges related to financial fraud and campaign finance violations. FTX itself also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-sues-sbf-and-other-former-execs-to-recover-over-1-billion-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> SBF and other executives this week to recover over $1 billion in lost customer assets.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum buyers have been struggling to push the price above the significant resistance region of $2K. Nevertheless, the price is currently navigating a crucial range bounded by that level and the dynamic support provided by the 100-day moving average.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By</strong> <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On June 21st, Ethereum managed to surpass the 100-day moving average and continued its prevailing uptrend after a pullback, eventually reaching the critical resistance area at $2K. Yet, the bullish momentum faded due to increased selling pressure around this level, resulting in minor rejections.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the price finds support at the 100-day MA, currently situated at $1,867, which has prevented further declines over the past few weeks. A breakout from this significant price range will likely play a pivotal role in determining Ethereum&#8217;s overall prospects in the mid-term.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261978" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261978" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261978 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_2207231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-Daily-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261978" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Upon analyzing the 4-hour timeframe, a bearish trend for Ethereum becomes evident as the price broke below its multi-week upward trendline after facing rejection at the $2K resistance zone. A subsequent pullback confirmed the breakout.</p>
<p>At present, ETH remains confined between two critical price levels: the static resistance at $2K and the critical support at $1,850. This suggests the potential for a range-bound market stage characterized by consolidation candles and the absence of a strong trend.</p>
<p>The price is expected to remain within this range until a breakout occurs, revealing the upcoming direction for Ethereum.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By</strong> <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<p>The provided chart displays the Estimated Leverage Ratio in correlation with ETH&#8217;s price. This metric gauges the average leverage employed by participants in the futures market. Generally, higher values indicate more investors are taking on greater leverage and risk in the derivatives market.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Estimated Leverage Ratio has seen a slight increase, suggesting that the futures market may be getting overheated due to the recent bullish price trends. However, it hasn&#8217;t reached concerning levels yet. Nonetheless, if the metric continues to surge, caution is advised as it could lead to a short or long-squeeze event.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, Ethereum&#8217;s price could experience a sudden and significant movement.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a sudden surge, Ripple&#8217;s price has reached a critical resistance region, which represents its previous major swing high formed in late April. However, after such an explosive move, it&#8217;s typical for the price to enter into consolidation.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Upon analyzing the daily chart, it becomes evident that Ripple experienced a significant price jump after finding support at the 100-day moving average. However, it now confronts a significant resistance zone at $0.85, marked by substantial selling pressure.</p>
<p>This development indicates a bullish sentiment among Ripple traders. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that a consolidation correction stage is essential following impulsive price surges to confirm the strength of the trend and let the market rest for a while.</p>
<p>Hence, it is expected that the price will enter a short-term correction phase, leading to higher volatility and pullback legs before the next notable upward movement takes place.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261980" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261980" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261980 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_2207231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-4H-4-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261980" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>The 4-hour chart reveals that the price has successfully broken above the upper edge of a channel, evident from a large green candle resulting from a recent explosive rally. Nonetheless, a pullback to the broken level is required to validate the breakout.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the price action, it seems likely that the price will undergo a correction period, retracing back to the upper boundary and completing a pullback. Consequently, if successful, the market can anticipate continuing the bullish rally, pushing the price to higher regions.</p>
<p>However, in the event of a decline below the channel&#8217;s upper boundary, the static support at $0.56 will become Ripple&#8217;s next target.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Belief in El Salvador’s national debt has resurrected throughout the past 12 months as it demonstrates its ability to make its payments.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bonds issued by El Salvador, the first country in the world to establish Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender, are up 60% in value this year – rivaling Bitcoin’s 80% gains.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sudden demand for the country’s national debt represents a massive sentiment shift around its financial position. Yields for El Salvador’s 10-year debt ran as high as 24% just 12 months ago, in line with distressed economies like Ukraine and Argentina.</li>
<li>However, the country successfully <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/despite-embracing-bitcoin-el-salvador-repaid-its-800-million-bond/" data-wpel-link="internal">repaid</a> $800 million of short-term debt in January, alongside interest, proving both media and credit rating agencies wrong.</li>
<li>Last year, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/its-the-time-to-buy-el-salvadoran-bonds-says-morgan-stanley/" data-wpel-link="internal">Morgan Stanley</a> anticipated that it was a good time to buy Salvadoran bonds, believing the government could “muddle through” its interest payments in the short term.</li>
<li>Aaron Stern, Chief Investment Officer at Converium Capital in Montreal, told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/move-over-bitcoin-el-salvador-sovereign-bonds-not-done-rallying-2023-07-19/#:~:text=Salvadoran%20dollar%20bonds%20currently%20yield,yet%20time%20to%20cash%20out." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Reuters</a> that the nation’s bond prices were “divorced from fundamentals,&#8221; in the summer of 2022.</li>
<li>&#8220;The market was concerned about the administration&#8217;s willingness to pay,&#8221; he said. Now, the nation’s bonds look attractive next to the debt prices of other emerging market nations.</li>
<li>Data from Refinitiev shows that the nation’s bonds currently yield between 14% and 18%. Despite their bullish performance this year, some believe it&#8217;s not time to cash out.</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;El Salvador is somewhat uniquely positioned as one of the highest yielding &#8216;performing&#8217; distressed credits,&#8221; said BNP Paribas&#8217; Nathalie Marshik, a managing director for Latin America fixed income.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>El Salvador’s bond performance has mimicked that of Bitcoin throughout the past year, crashing in the summer of 2022 before rallying across the first half of 2023.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Decurity stated that the firm met with unexpected friction from DxSale after reporting the security bug. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A security outfit led by ethical hackers who specialize in security audits claimed to be offered a $500 bounty by DxSale Network, a decentralized token launchpad, after informing the platform of a breach that could cost it over $5 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reward is one of the lowest ever offered to a white hat hacker.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">$500 Reward for Saving $5 million</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Decurity, in a recent <a href="https://blog.decurity.io/dx-protocol-vulnerability-disclosure-bddff88aeb1d" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog post</a>, revealed that one of its researchers on June 28, 2023, discovered a bug in an unverified smart contract on the Binance smart chain (BSC) belonging to DxSale and was offered a reward of $500 for their efforts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the firm, investigations exposed a contract logic that was not secure enough to prevent hackers from draining funds locked in the contract during an initial decentralized offering (IDO).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on calculations, a total of 21,600 WBNB (wrapped BNB) tokens in the pools worth around $5.2 million at the time of the report could have been stolen if hackers noticed the vulnerability. Meanwhile, the security firm stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Note that this figure reflects the losses that could be inflicted by an exploit that targets a single instance of the locking contract. However, Dx has more locking contracts on BSC and other chains.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 dir="ltr">Alleged Poor Response From DxSale</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Decurity claimed to contact DxSale after confirming the bug but said they first encountered friction from the project&#8217;s team, which was initially unresponsive, and later claimed to be aware of the problem. According to the blog post, the team stated that the contract in question was inactive, which meant that it was not a threat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the initial response from DxSale, Decurity stated that it was able to get in contact with DxSale&#8217;s founders and developers to discuss the situation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a way to fix the bug, the project&#8217;s developers decided to set high locking fees on June 29 as a solution to the issue to discourage attackers from carrying out an action. According to Decurity, the solution could deter hackers, but DxSale owners could drain the funds in the event of a potential rug pull.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although the Dx team tried to debunk claims about hackers being able to drain funds, citing protection from several auditing partners, including CertiK Skynet, the project reportedly moved to set high fees across other chains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Decurity, meanwhile, expressed some concerns about DxSale&#8217;s response to potential security threats, advising users to be careful when interacting with projects on the protocol.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While DxSale has not responded to Decurity&#8217;s claims, the decentralized launchpad announced a <a href="https://twitter.com/dxsale/status/1681303366247526404?s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">partnership</a> with security outfit Vital Block Security on July 18.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Most of the market remains completely flat in the past 24 hours, but TRX is pumping ahead. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past 24 hours in the cryptocurrency markets saw the total capitalization increase by some $6 billion. In other words, not much happened. Some of the major coins are charting ever-so-slight gains, but in general, the trend remains largely rangebound.</p>
<p>Bitcoin remains indecisive at $30K and unable to escape that range, but let&#8217;s see how it all fared.</p>
<h2>BTC Price Flat at $30K</h2>
<p>As you can clearly see in the chart below, the past 24 hours didn&#8217;t provide anything of substance when it comes to Bitcoin&#8217;s price in particular.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency continues to flirt with $30K, but neither side can manage to take control. The bulls have failed to recapture the level decisively, while the sellers are also unable to push the price toward another support zone.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261938" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261938" style="width: 1183px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD_2023-07-22_11-22-05.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261938 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD_2023-07-22_11-22-05.png" alt="BTCUSD_2023-07-22_11-22-05" width="1183" height="491" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD_2023-07-22_11-22-05.png 1183w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD_2023-07-22_11-22-05-300x125.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD_2023-07-22_11-22-05-1024x425.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD_2023-07-22_11-22-05-768x319.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD_2023-07-22_11-22-05-50x21.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1183px) 100vw, 1183px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261938" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>To this, the altcoins have also failed to capitalize on BTC&#8217;s stagnation. This is clearly reflected in Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance &#8211; the metric that tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market. It&#8217;s also remained flat at 46.6% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<h2>TRON (TRX) Soars 8%, But That&#8217;s It</h2>
<p>The heatmap below paints a green picture for the past day, but most of the gains are rather inconsiderable. For instance, BNB, ADA, ETH, UNI, XMR, LINK, and many other cryptocurrencies failed to increase by even 1%.</p>
<p>The most obvious exception to this is TRON&#8217;s TRX. The altcoin pumped 8% on the day, and it&#8217;s one of the best performers from the top 100 coins by means of total market capitalization.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261939" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261939" style="width: 1494px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2207231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-261939" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2207231.jpg" alt="crypto_heatmap_2207231" width="1494" height="785" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2207231.jpg 1494w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2207231-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2207231-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2207231-768x404.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto_heatmap_2207231-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1494px) 100vw, 1494px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261939" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Quantify Crypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>XDC Network (XDC) exploded by some 15.5% on the day and is the cryptocurrency that gained the most over the last 24 hours. It&#8217;s followed by Casper Network&#8217;s CSPR and, you guessed it, TRX.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have FLEX Coin (FLEX), which is down 14.6%. The rest of the market remains largely flat.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The US SEC signaled that it might appeal the recent ruling in the case against Ripple. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legal war between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs appears to be far from over.</p>
<p>While the latter managed a partial win following a recent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/has-ripple-xrp-won-or-will-the-sec-appeal-what-will-happen-next/" data-wpel-link="internal">court ruling</a>, the Commission doesn&#8217;t seem to be backing down just yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to a recent report by Bloomberg, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has asked a federal judge to ignore key parts of the recent ruling in the agency&#8217;s case with Ripple Labs.</li>
<li>The watchdog argues that the decision fails to reflect existing securities regulations.</li>
<li>In a <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/raAgcBtaEU24/v0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">fresh filing</a> in another case &#8211; against Terraform Labs and former Terra-Luna CEO Do Kwon, the regulator says:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Ripple creates an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors, improperly transforms Howey&#8217;s reasonable investor inquiry into a subjective one, and turns on its head the reasoning underlying Howey and other cases.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recall that Judge Analisa Torres recently ruled partially in favor of Ripple Labs in their case against the SEC, arguing that secondary sales of XRP do not constitute an investment contract.</li>
<li>The price of XRP <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-16-as-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ripple-in-sec-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">exploded</a> immediately after the news broke out and has doubled since.</li>
<li>But is XRP in trouble again? With the SEC signaling a potential appeal, the case might be headed to trial and the legal battle might drag on, putting additional pressure on the cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple wants to test issuance of CBDCs and stablecoins through a new partnership. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been an ongoing point of discussion for a while now.</p>
<p>Ripple &#8211; the company behind one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrencies, XRP &#8211; has entered into a new partnership aimed at fostering support for both.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to a recent <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/making-the-digital-economy-safe-for-business/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Ripple partnered with a company called  &#8220;SUPER HOW?&#8221;</li>
<li>The partnership aims to become a catalyst for testing and issuing digital assets, which include stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The aim is to bolster the confidence of regulators when it comes to the security and the safety of these assets.</li>
<li>The collaboration will be known as the Axiology project &#8211; a tokenized securities and settlement system infrastructure.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s worth noting that the effort comes following a move by the EU Commission, which introduced a somewhat innovative pilot program akin to a sandbox, which provides temporary exemptions from existing regulations.</li>
