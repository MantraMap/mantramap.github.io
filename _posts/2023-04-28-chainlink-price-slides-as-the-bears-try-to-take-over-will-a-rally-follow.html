Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing price volatility today despite its slight gains. The bears aim to take control over the price action as LINK dropped from $8.5764 on April 18 to $7.7704 on April 19, 2023.  Its trading volume is up by 97% in the last 24 hours. It also gained 2.27% on its price yesterday. But LINK price shows a decline on today&#8217;s chart representing a bear control. Notably, the overall crypto market cap is down by 0.92%, indicating that bears are in control. Top coins such as BTC and ETH display a bearish trend that is most likely pushing other altcoins to decline. What&#8217;s Ahead For LINK? LINK has formed a red candle on today&#8217;s daily chart, dropping below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a short-term bearish sentiment.  Also, it has remained in the sideways trend that began on April 22, 2023, showing that the bears and bulls might be at a stalemate in the market. The price change in this period is slight, but a spike in trading activity is evident for the asset.  Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential LINK&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 44.58, descending to the oversold region. It implies that further price decline is possible in the coming days. LINK is still above its 200-day SMA despite the price volatility. The 200-day SMA has turned into a support level for the asset at $6.942, indicating a recovery in the long term. Other vital support levels are $6.4 and $6.75. Also, its resistance levels are $7.456, $7.735, $8.8, and $9.48. At the $7.456 resistance, the bears intend to keep LINK&#8217;s price down.  It will likely descend to the $6.942 support level soon, which can act as a pivot point to spark a bullish rally.  Chainlink Upcoming Hackathon Event Sparks Hope Of A Rally The Chainlink Hackathon event promises to bring exciting innovators and developers together.
