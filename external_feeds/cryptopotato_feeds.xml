            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin&#8217;s price is on a path of considerable recovery, with the asset reaching almost $29,000 a few hours ago (a valuation last seen at the beginning of May).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This resulted in approximately $155 million in liquidations, with short positions representing the bigger share.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin has been one of the best performers in the crypto market ever since the end of last week when BlackRock </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with the US SEC to introduce a BTC Spot ETF in the States. The primary digital asset ascended from around $25,000 to nearly $26,500 shortly after the announcement.</span></li>
<li>While the price gradually climbed in the following days, it went on a massive rally yesterday (June 20), spiking to almost $28,800 (per CoinGecko data).</li>
<li>Logically, the six-week high resulted in massive liquidations. Coinglass <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the number had surpassed $155 million for the past 24 hours, with short traders responsible for $122 million (78% of that portion).</span></li>
<li>Bitcoin trades accounted for over $70 million of the total share, whereas Ethereum added another $25 million.</li>
<li>Currently, BTC is hovering around $28,700, while its <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">dominance</a> against alternative coins <span data-preserver-spaces="true">is</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> at a two-year high above 50%.<br />

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DZ Bank &#8211; another leading financial institution in the country &#8211; has already progressed in that field, partnering with Metaco and Harmonize to offer digital asset custody to institutional clients. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recent Bloomberg coverage </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/deutsche-bank-applies-for-digital-asset-license-amid-growth-push-1.1935388" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">informed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that Deutsche Bank (the biggest German bank with millions of customers and total assets exceeding $1.4 trillion) has applied with the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) to establish its &#8220;digital assets and custody business.&#8221; </span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The research determined that cryptocurrencies are the sixth most popular investment choice for Australians.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest ASX Australian Investor Study estimated that approximately 15% of Australians have invested some of their wealth in cryptocurrencies. The figure is somewhat similar to the 17% registered during the bull market in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The research further showed that young Aussies are more inclined towards the industry, with 31% being HODLers.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest Trends in &#8216;The Land Down Under&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the <a href="https://www2.asx.com.au/investors/investment-tools-and-resources/australian-investor-study" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">analysis</a>, roughly every seventh Australian has entered the cryptocurrency market, with males (69%) making the bigger share of investors. Most individuals have spent between $340 and $3,400 on digital currencies, while only 10% have invested over $67,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A closer look at the different demographic groups shows that youngsters are significantly more interested in the market than older generations. 31% of the so-called &#8220;next generation investors,&#8221; or those at an average age of 21, have bought Bitcoin or altcoins. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company that conducted the study believes younger individuals are more &#8220;risk averse than their older counterparts,&#8221; which is why they are more likely to tolerate crypto&#8217;s volatility and enter its ecosystem. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The majority understand the cyclical nature of investing, with 29% saying a fall of 20% in their portfolio balances is a risk they understand could happen and another 36% saying if this happened, they&#8217;d be concerned but would wait to see if the situation improved,&#8221; ASX stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It added that &#8220;next generation investors&#8221; are excited about new technologies and sometimes wish to get involved with things their parents would avoid. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">High-value investors (HVIs) also find the sector attractive. 33% own digital currencies, while their median investment is nearly $88,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The next study&#8217;s overall figures could ascend should &#8220;intending investors&#8221; (around 1.33 million people) decide to hop on the bandwagon. That portion represents people who have not made any investments but consider doing so in the next 12 months. 29% of them admitted they would select cryptocurrencies above all other options.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Investing in shares and real estate remains the most common choice for Aussies. Term deposits, ETFs, and international shares round up the top 5, whereas crypto ranks sixth.</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last Year&#8217;s Numbers</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It seems like the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market has caused a severe investor outflow among Australians since Independent Research </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/over-90-of-australians-have-heard-about-bitcoin-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in November 2022 that over 25% of the locals were HODLers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similar to ASX, last year&#8217;s analysis determined that youngsters are more likely to have bought digital assets. In comparison, only 10% of those above 65 years old have done so.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto awareness was at a high level, with almost 90% knowing about Bitcoin&#8217;s existence. Nearly 43% had some knowledge about Ethereum (ETH), while Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) were also popular.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Major cryptocurrencies are offering mixed returns as the crypto market remains prone to extreme bearishness amid poor macroeconomic conditions. While Bitcoin has surged over 3% in the past week, XRP has corrected by over 9% in the same period.</p>
<p>With Ripple’s lawsuit against the SEC expected to get more clarity in the coming months, XRP investors believe that the token can show strong price movement with a positive result.</p>
<p>However, amid uncertainty with the outcome of the court case and wider concerns across the market, investors are also eyeing other tokens that could be subject to less volatility. One such token is yPredict, which is showing bullish momentum with over $2.5m raised in its presale.</p>
<h2><strong>XRP Price Plummets Despite Crypto Recovery, When Will It Bounce Back?</strong></h2>
<p>Much to the anguish of Ripple supporters, the XRP token remains bearish in the weekly time frame despite the Hinman documents being unsealed last week.</p>
<p>The token has slipped almost 9% over the past week and is currently trading at $0.48, having been as high as $0.56 on June 13.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-15.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256170" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-15.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="902" height="494" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-15.jpg 902w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-15-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-15-768x421.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-15-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></a></p>
<p>After the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase for illegal operation and sale of unregistered securities, XRP has become one of the most important tokens in the crypto market. Ripple was one of the first companies to be sued by the SEC as the top regulatory body labeled XRP as an unregistered security.</p>
<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently come out strongly against the SEC. In a video posted to his Twitter account, Garlinghouse accused the financial watchdog of acting in bad faith &#8211; he clarified that even after multiple meetings, the SEC never told him that XRP was a security.</p>
<p>Even Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano blockchain, expressed his wish to mend things with the Ripple community. Previously, Hoskinson has found himself at odds with the community and labeled it as toxic and petty. However, in light of the regulatory pressure on Cardano, Hoskinson is now singing a different tune.</p>
<p>XRP lawyer John Deaton has recently stated that the chances of an outright Ripple victory are much higher than an outright SEC victory, and a potential XRP victory is significant for the market in that it may itself start a bull run.</p>
<p>The William Hinman documents were unsealed last week and immediately saw XRP pump to $0.56. The documents are a significant part of the Ripple defense as the former SEC chief and senior leadership in the regulator described them as not being securities in various documents leading up to a 2018 speech.</p>
<p>Although the price has since dropped below $0.50, Craig Cobb of Tradercobb.com believes that <a href="https://www.finder.com/ripple-xrp-price-prediction" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP can hit the $1 mark</a> in case of a potential win &#8211; however, a loss could see the token correct all the way to $0.24.</p>
<p>The token’s technical analysis <a href="https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/technicals/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shows</a> that its price is currently on a knife’s edge.TradingView gives a neutral signal to XRP in the weekly time frame, which improves to a Buy signal when considering the moving averages.</p>
<p>Investors would hope that the token breaches the Exponential Moving Average (200) at $0.49 to see a bullish surge.</p>
<h2><strong>Which Tokens Can Outperform The Bear Market?</strong></h2>
<p>While XRP’s price remains in the doldrums, investors are looking for alternate projects that can outperform the prevalent bearishness.</p>
<p>Experts believe that tokens with high utility and real-world value will be the top performers, while projects with strong community backing can also see explosive price movement.</p>
<p>One such example is <a href="https://bs_72a7e4de.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">yPredict</a>, which is currently on presale. Let’s take a look at how yPredict meets these criteria and why it is well-suited as an alternative to XRP.</p>
<h2><strong>Revolutionary AI Analytics Platform yPredict Raises $2.5 Million Through Presale</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://bs_72a7e4de.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">yPredict token</a> has been one of the most consistent performers in the crypto bear market since its presale launched.</p>
<p>As market volatility continues to wildly fluctuate, retail traders are backing the yPredict platform due to its wide range of trading tools and AI-based predictive trading.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-18.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256169" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-18.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="339" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-18.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-18-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-18-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The YPRED token has now raised almost $2.5 million and is well on its way to hitting the targeted $2.9 million that will trigger a price increase.</p>
<p>The all-in-one platform provides tools for traders with all levels of experience &#8211; all YPRED holders are eligible for free-of-cost access to the Predictions platform. It consists of accurate price prediction models for thousands of crypto assets and securities.</p>
<p>Similarly, yPredict Analytics provides high-quality market insights to traders through pattern recognition alerts, transaction data analysis, and sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>There are three membership tiers available (free, active, pro), with YPRED used to pay for those and each tier offering access to different levels of features and tools &#8211; pro-tier traders can utilize the sophisticated Terminal trading engine to execute their trades at a blazing-fast speed.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-12.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256167" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-12.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="902" height="256" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-12.jpg 902w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-12-300x85.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-12-768x218.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture4-12-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></a></p>
<p>Due to its incredibly powerful products, the yPredict ecosystem already has over 20,000 users on its waiting list.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the YPRED token has one of the most lucrative tokenomics of any project currently in its presale. Aside from the heavy discounts on various yPredict services, holders can earn up to a 45% quarterly staking reward.</p>
<p>The token is currently in the sixth of the 8-stage of its presale and is currently priced at $0.09. However, it will soon surge 33.3% to its $0.12 listing price, offering a limited opportunity for investors to take advantage of the early presale price.</p>
<p>YPRED tokens can be purchased with a bank card or by swapping ETH, USDT, or MATIC tokens.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The hackers, believed to be the Lazarus group, have used chain hopping numerous times after successful heists. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After making off with $35 million worth of ill-gotten crypto, the hackers who targeted Atomic Wallet earlier this month have covered their on-chain tracks using the cross-chain liquidity protocol THORChain.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the crypto tracking platform </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MistTrack_io/status/1671056400410382342" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">MistTrack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the hacker’s address transferred 503 Ether (ETH) to THORChain over the past two days. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Those funds were then swapped for Bitcoin (BTC) and bridged into a Bitcoin address. In addition, much of the stolen ETH was converted to BTC using the SWFT blockchain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>https://twitter.com/MistTrack_io/status/1671056400410382342</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">On-chain sleuth ZachXBT </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/over-35-million-reportely-stolen-from-atomic-wallet-users/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> this month that Atomic Wallet users had lost upwards of $35 million in total after receiving numerous reports from users claiming to have had their funds drained. Stolen assets included BTC, ETH, Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), BNB Coin (BNB), and Polygon (MATIC). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic later connected the North Korean hacking group Lazarus to the theft, after stolen funds were </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hacker-funnels-stolen-crypto-to-north-korea-tied-coin-mixer-elliptic/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">laundered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> through Sinbad.io – a coin mixer used by the group. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The following week, hackers </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hackers-used-ofac-sanctioned-garantex-to-launder-stolen-35m-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">transferred</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> some of the stolen assets to the Russian crypto exchange Garantex, which is sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Before that, hackers used 1INCH to exchange their assets for USDT. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lazarus Group hackers have used chain-hopping numerous times to conceal funds. After the $600 million Ronin bridge hack last year, the group </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ronin-hackers-have-moved-the-stolen-625m-to-bitcoin-network-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the REN protocol and other CEXs to move their stolen assets over to Bitcoin. </span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[A bearish signal on Cardano’s daily chart reflects the impact of ongoing regulatory pressure against crypto. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cardano (ADA)’s price flashed a ‘Death Cross’ over the weekend – a bearish technical indicator signaling downward price momentum and a potential incoming tailspin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This comes two weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Coinbase, naming ADA as a security in the process.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Death Cross occurs when an asset’s 50-day simple moving average crosses beneath its 200-day moving average. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">According to </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD/technicals/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">TradingView</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, nearly all of Cardano’s moving average indicators are flashing a “sell” signal. The last time the asset flashed a death cross, in particular, was in December 2021 – the onset of a year-long downtrend for both Cardano and all of crypto. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The asset later flashed its counterpart signal – a ‘Golden Cross’ – in March, as the collapse of numerous banks triggered a rush of capital into Bitcoin and other digital assets. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Though considered unreliable on its own, the death cross arrives just as the SEC filed lawsuits against two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the latter lawsuit, ADA was </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-sec-claims-these-coins-are-securities-in-the-lawsuit-against-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">named</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a security alongside a dozen other crypto assets, most of which have suffered especially strongly after the case was filed. Since then, ADA is down ~30%, trading for $0.25 apiece.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ongoing pressure against altcoins has driven up Bitcoin dominance this month, which reclaimed 50% on Monday for the first time since 2021. Bitcoin billionaire Michael Saylor has </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/michael-saylor-thinks-the-sec-crackdown-could-boost-bitcoins-dominance-to-80/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">predicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the regulatory crackdown on competing coins could ultimately drive the asset’s dominance beyond 80% in the long term. </span></li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hawkish approach of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has caused many prominent cryptocurrency companies to look abroad.</p>
<p>Gemini is amongst them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange led by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, has announced plans to expand its headcount in Singapore.</li>
<li>The company <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-announces-expansion-plans-in-apac" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> in a blog post that it plans to increase its Singapore offices to over 100 employees.</li>
<li>They also plan to include an engineering base in India as part of the APAC expansion.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Our Singapore office will serve as a hub for our larger APAC operations. We believe that APAC will be a great driver of the next wave of growth for crypto and Gemini. &#8211; Reads the blog post.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gemini is far from being the only company with plans to expand outside of the US. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has also hinted at the same as the SEC continues to clamp down on crypto-related businesses.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has soared by 11% in the past week, with the token posting five bullish daily closes in a row.</p>
<p>SHIB hasn’t had a hot streak like this since early March – and meme coin enthusiasts are now debating what’s behind the rise and whether it can be sustained.</p>
<p>In other news, fellow meme coin project Wall Street Memes (WSM) continues to wow the investment community during its presale, raising over $8.7 million in early funding.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Showcases Stellar Performance to Create Bullish Trend</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is hovering around the $0.00000718 level following a surprise bullish surge that has left long-term holders delighted.</p>
<p>Before this surge, SHIB had been on an extended downtrend and was trading at lows that hadn&#8217;t been seen since September 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-3.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256109" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-3.png" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="268" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-3.png 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-3-300x134.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture1-3-50x22.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, a clean rejection from the major support zone around $0.0000060 has caused an uptick in bullish momentum &#8211; with investors now hopeful that this momentum can be prolonged.</p>
<p>Per CoinMarketCap, over $100 million worth of SHIB was <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">traded</a> in the past 24 hours, making it the 24<sup>th</sup> most active cryptocurrency on the market.</p>
<p>In addition, the number of retail investor holdings of SHIB has begun to gradually increase once more – indicating renewed interest from those who had previously been on the sidelines.</p>
<h2>SHIB Surge Driven By Positive Market Forces</h2>
<p>There doesn’t appear to be any direct news playing into Shiba Inu’s recent rise, with the coin instead benefitting from renewed optimism in the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>One potential reason for this renewed optimism is the Fed’s decision to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-poised-punt-rate-hike-into-summer-wind-2023-06-14/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pause</a> interest rate hikes for the first time since March 2022 – hinting that rates may not need to go any higher.</p>
<p>This is positive news for crypto traders, as it provides scope for interest rates to come down before the end of the year. When interest rates decrease, it makes &#8220;risky&#8221; assets (like SHIB) more appealing to investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256108" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-17.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="324" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-17-300x161.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture2-17-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Another potential reason for Shiba Inu&#8217;s uptick is the significant increase in the SHIB burn rate.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Shibburn Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/shibburn/status/1670431222277840899" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that the burn rate had increased by 730% in the previous 24 hours, indicating that a substantial number of SHIB tokens are being removed from circulation.</p>
<p>In turn, this is reducing the total supply of SHIB and increasing the value of the remaining tokens – a fact that’s certainly caught the interest of long-term holders.</p>
<h2>Which Other Meme Coins Are Traders Backing?</h2>
<p>As SHIB makes a bullish resurgence, investors are also turning their attention to the burgeoning field of new meme coins.</p>
<p>Among these, one name gaining significant traction is Wall Street Memes (WSM) – a project looking to capture the essence of meme culture.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Emerges As Potential Meme Coin Challenger &amp; Raises $8.7m</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes (WSM)</a> is a new meme coin project from the creators of the Wall St Bulls NFT collection, which sold out in just over 30 minutes back in 2021, raising an incredible $2.5 million.</p>
<p>This new project looks to “tokenize” the Wall Street Memes community by releasing WSM – an ERC-20 token that allows holders to benefit financially from the community’s growth.</p>
<p>Per the project’s <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, the developers seek to use the brand power of Wall Street Memes to reshape the world of finance through laughter, unity, and the strength of memes.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-15.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256107" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-15.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="300" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-15.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-15-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Picture3-15-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This mission underpins everything the community does – and has helped it grow to over 1.1 million “degens” since the success of the Wall St Bulls NFT collection.</p>
<p>Currently, Wall Street Memes is in its 30-stage presale phase, meaning early investors can purchase WSM tokens at a discounted price relative to the eventual listing price.</p>
<p>This appealing setup has helped generate a remarkable $8.7 million in investment since the presale launched just weeks ago.</p>
<p>Given that well-known YouTuber Michael Wrubel released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTdUPbXVujc&amp;pp=ygUYd2FsbCBzdHJlZXQgbWVtZXMgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a> just one day ago detailing how WSM &#8220;could make you rich,&#8221; it&#8217;s clear that the project is beginning to gain traction in mainstream crypto circles.</p>
