Chiliz Upgrades On The Horizon The first of the upcoming upgrades focuses on streamlining the deployment of factory contracts. In a bid to improve efficiency, Chiliz plans to enable such contracts to be deployed without the need for whitelisting as deployers.¬† This move is expected to simplify the process while maintaining a level of security by ensuring that the factory contract is still initiated by a whitelisted deployer. By reducing friction in the contract deployment process, Chiliz aims to enhance user experience and attract a wider range of participants. The second upgrade revolves around staking pool contract enhancements. Chiliz aims to address issues related to the accuracy of voting power displayed for validators and the calculation of delegated amounts.¬† Chiliz is currently trading at $0.0748. Chart by TradingView.com To rectify this, the Chiliz team has indicated that a temporary downtime for the delegated and undelegated features will be necessary during the upgrade. While this may temporarily inconvenience users, the improvements are anticipated to provide a more accurate and transparent staking experience. Impact On CHZ Price As Chiliz enthusiasts eagerly await these upgrades, the impact on the price of CHZ remains a topic of interest. At the time of writing, CHZ is in the red in all timeframes, and priced at $0.074903 according to CoinGecko. The past 24 hours have seen a decline of 1.2% in its value, while the past seven days have witnessed a decline of 1.5%. These fluctuations underscore the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. CHZ price action today.
