<p>Cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-bullish-on-defi-blackrock-speaks-on-impact-of-recent-xrp-ruling/">Binance</a> announced today, June 17th, the integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and it is now open to customers to use the Lightning Network to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin (BTC).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> has completed the integration of Bitcoin ( <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a> ) on the Lightning Network and deposits and withdrawals are now open. <br><br>More details here <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/aIofPdtAGY">https://t.co/aIofPdtAGY</a></p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1680777249090576385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The Lightning Network is a second-layer expansion solution built on the Bitcoin blockchain. This network enables users to establish off-chain transaction pipelines, ensuring faster, more affordable, and scalable transactions while mitigating congestion issues on the cryptocurrency blockchain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-explosion-spurs-binance-to-implement-lightning-network"><strong>Bitcoin Explosion Spurs Binance to Implement Lightning Network</strong></h2>



<p>In May, the Binance exchange confirmed that it would bring Lightning Network support after the exchange could not offer Bitcoin withdrawals smoothly even with high gas fees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a large volume of withdrawal transactions from Binance still pending as our set fees did not anticipate the recent surge in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> network gas fees.<br><br>Our team is working to accelerate the confirmation of all pending transactions.<br><br>We&#39;ll provide updates here.</p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655402071435411457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Before Binance, only a certain number of cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Bitfinex, River Financial, OKX, Kraken, CoinCorner, etc.) offered Bitcoin withdrawals via the Lightning Network, but now Binance is on this list.</p>



<p>In April of this year, the U.S. public cryptocurrency exchange also confirmed that it will bring customers Bitcoin Lightning Network withdrawal support.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance and Regulatory Hurdles</strong></h2>



<p>Over the years, Binance has ranked among the top cryptocurrency exchanges for its highly secure and responsive services.</p>



<p>Despite the better service, the exchange faces a formidable legal hurdle in the U.S. due to regulatory action by two of the country’s top financial regulators against its cryptocurrency services.</p>



<p>Currently, the exchange is focused on making some major changes to its services to be able to easily comply with the new rules and regulations set out under the framework of the European Union (EU) Market in Cryptocurrency Assets (MiCA), which will at some stage in the coming years take effect.</p>

<p>In the past seven days, the price of XRP has experienced a remarkable surge, capturing the attention of traders and crypto enthusiasts alike. Notably, the interest in XRP has soared, with a 122% increase in Google searches for &#8216;Ripple news.&#8217; </p>



<p>This surge in interest suggests the potential for significant market activity in the coming months. Thomas Kralow, a crypto hedge fund manager, predicts that XRP could achieve an unprecedented milestone, reaching a record-breaking price range of $10 to $30 per coin in the next 3-4 months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-ipo-and-its-potential-impact"><strong>Ripple&#8217;s IPO and its Potential Impact</strong></h2>



<p>One of the significant factors driving the excitement around XRP is the speculation surrounding Ripple&#8217;s initial public offering (IPO). </p>



<p>As Ripple, the company behind XRP, prepares to go public; there is immense speculation regarding the potential impact of this groundbreaking event on the crypto industry. </p>



<p>Many believe <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">Ripple&#8217;s IPO</a> could lead to a nearly half-a-trillion dollars valuation, significantly increasing XRP&#8217;s market capitalization and bolstering its price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Pops In Ballistic Rally As Judge Finally Rules It Isn’t A Security</strong></h2>



<p>Another factor fueling optimism is the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">latest Ripple victory</a> in court against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>



<p>U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres granted summary judgment in favor of Ripple, indicating that the XRP token is not a security.</p>



<p>The anticipation of a positive outcome has always spurred speculative buying, with experts believing that things going in Ripple&#8217;s favor would propel XRP from $2 to $10.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Price Target for XRP</strong></h2>



<p>Considering these factors, many experts and market observers are setting ambitious price targets for XRP. Thomas Kralow, with his extensive experience in the crypto industry, believes that XRP has the potential to reach a minimum price of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-at-10-envisioned-amid-growing-network-metrics-even-as-ripple-aims-to-claim-big-win-in-sec-case/">$10 per coin</a> and, optimistically, even achieve a target of $30. The combination of Ripple&#8217;s IPO, the anticipation surrounding the lawsuit&#8217;s outcome, and the increased public interest in XRP could poise the cryptocurrency for substantial growth in the coming months.</p>



<p>As XRP experiences a notable <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">price surge</a> of over 80%, the cryptocurrency community&#8217;s interest in this digital asset continues to grow. With experts like Thomas Kralow predicting price targets ranging from $10 to $30, it is clear that the cryptocurrency has the potential to achieve new heights. </p>



<p>However, it is essential to consider the factors influencing XRP&#8217;s trajectory, including the outcome of Ripple&#8217;s IPO and the next phase of the SEC case.</p>

<p>U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand are set to introduce a revised version of the cryptocurrency regulation bill to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital asset transactions and stablecoin issuance. The revised version advocates treating crypto assets as &#8220;commodities,&#8221; expanding the CFTC&#8217;s powers and imposing stricter regulations on stablecoin issuers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-assets-are-positioned-as-commodities"><strong>Crypto assets are positioned as “commodities”</strong></h2>



<p>The main goal of the revised bill is to define encrypted assets as &#8220;commodities&#8221; and give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) more power in the spot market and digital asset exchanges. </p>



<p>This will enable crypto asset companies to create assets based on custom criteria and be subject to commodity laws. Additionally, stablecoin issuers would be required to be federal or state-level depository institutions and maintain high-quality liquid assets such as cash, short-term Treasury bills, and reserve certificates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CFTC competes with SEC for regulatory power</strong></h2>



<p>If the amended bill passes, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will each receive $500 million in additional funding. However, the SEC will be prohibited from using additional funds for law enforcement purposes. At the same time, the CFTC will only be able to use funds if it is a chartered cryptocurrency-only agency. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will allocate $150 million over five years for consumer education and enforcement related to digital assets.&#x200d;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Changes to the tax treatment of digital assets</strong></h2>



<p>Lummis and Gillibrand proposed changes to the tax treatment of digital assets, including improving the definition of a broker in the 2021 Infrastructure Act. The definition raises concerns about cryptocurrency developers and other online players being treated as financial intermediaries for tax purposes. It&#8217;s worth noting that the bill&#8217;s broad scope and the jurisdiction of multiple Senate committees could make it more challenging on the path to law.</p>

<p>Former hedge fund manager Raoul Pal has made a bold statement about Bitcoin and the entire <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-reveals-what-market-conditions-could-supercharge-bitcoin-price-to-310000/">cryptocurrency market</a>. Pal, who is known to be vocal about his sentiments on the market, is positive that Bitcoin, along with the rest of the crypto market, will experience a mega bull run in the near term.</p>



<p>Pal made this known in a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/realvision/status/1679913653452283906?s=46&amp;t=qzsvHvtDB3yjTaoaylh-2g">interview</a> on the Real Vision Crypto media, as he asserted that the market is imitating bullish patterns from the 2015 &#8211; 2016 cycle. Pal claims that the current market is mirroring a structure similar to that time.</p>



<p>As he further explains, in 2019, the market started off on a bullish note and saw a 300% pump over a period of time. The market later experienced a massive decline, and eventually rallied by more than 700% within a short period.</p>



<p>The market should expect to see more chaos within the banking sector, which will cause the Federal Reserve to intervene, Pal asserted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As he’s quoted saying;</p>



<p><em>“I have a feeling we might go parabolic earlier here because I think we’re getting closer to a banking crisis within the regional banks that will require the Federal Reserve to step in. Interest rates are getting out of control, so interest rates going up and the yield curve inverted, bad news bears for the banks.”</em></p>



<p>Presently the KRE ETF (Regional Banking ETF) is valued at $43.13, and Pal is asserting that the KRE ETF can be used to decipher where the market currently is.</p>



<p>Once a breakout between the $35 and $30 mark begins, the Fed&#8217;s going to take action. Along with the banking crisis is the ongoing real estate crisis, which Pal believes could also play a role in influencing the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decisions.</p>



<p>Conclusively, Pal expects the Fed to backpedal on its current stance but also offer the liquidity necessary for the government to clear its National debt.</p>



<p><em>“Maybe that’s the reason the Fed is tightening rates even further is to create a crisis so they can cut rates, so they can monetize the debt. Because if they don’t, they have to print more money because the interest rates are higher to pay for the debt payments, and that becomes a total catastrophe.” He said. </em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is attempting to correct losses sustained over the week. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bullish-bitcoin-on-chain-metrics-now-approaching-levels-associated-with-re-accumulation-period/">Bitcoin</a>, which is currently up by 0.03%, is trading at a press time price of $30,264.</p>

<p>Leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance turned six. The cryptocurrency exchange has hit several milestones since its creation and has remained in business, despite the continuous crackdown on exchanges.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/binance-turns-6-8188278446020229815">blog post</a>, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, details the company’s achievements over the years while laying down his expectations for the future.</p>



<p>CZ, as he is fondly called, is bullish on the DeFi space, which he believes will continue to accelerate. The Binance boss makes a massive prediction, asserting that DeFi will dethrone and outperform the CeFi industry within the next six years.</p>



<p>With new wallet technologies making it easier for users to hold their crypto assets without a third party, the adoption of DeFi products and direct integration with blockchains will continue to skyrocket. Additionally, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-shakes-off-regulatory-pushback-from-q2-strengths-commitment-to-pioneering-defi-adoption/">DeFi</a> will create financial access for individuals that are unable to access TradeFi and banks.</p>



<p>“There are a few trends shaping up.” CZ writes as he touches on TradFi and institutional investors. The likes of BlackRock, Citadel, and Fidelity are making a notable entry into the crypto industry in significant ways, he added.</p>



<p>CZ refers to the entrance of these big players as validation for the technology that is crypto and the entire industry. In the long term, he believes these industry players will ease the institutional adoption of crypto.</p>



<p>“As institutional investors own the majority of the equity market, with hundreds of trillions of dollars, even a single digit % conversion into crypto will easily multiply the size of the current crypto market.” CZ wrote.</p>



<p>Regarding regulation in the industry, CZ asserts that regulatory clarity and regulated exchanges will continue to grow. While he admits that the market is still plagued with uncertainty, he remains confident that progress is already in motion and at a faster pace in many countries. He cites the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-calls-ripples-landmark-xrp-decision-a-milestone-win-for-crypto-industry-but-theres-a-catch/">XRP ruling</a> as one of the few examples that showcases notable progress in the regulatory sector. </p>



<p>“The XRP ruling on July 13, even though it wasn’t through a normal industry consultative process, is an example of that. The countries that get this right first will enjoy a huge advantage over countries that don’t, for centuries to come. We are at a pivotal moment in history.” CZ wrote.</p>

<p>Just days after the major <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">legal victory</a>, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse spoke with CNBC on the recent court decision in the legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Garlinghouse emphasized that the verdict in the lawsuit is good for the whole crypto industry, not just Ripple.</p>



<p>He stated, <em>&#8220;I think this is a huge win, not just for Ripple, but for the whole industry. It puts the SEC&#8217;s narrative and comments that they make publicly about all of these digital assets being securities in check.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Garlinghouse stressed the need for clear rules to control the cryptocurrency sector. He voiced that it is unhealthy to try to regulate by enforcement. Instead, he pushed for unambiguous legislation that laid out the ground principles for all businesspeople operating in the cryptocurrency industry. According to the Ripple CEO, the SEC&#8217;s legal activities have stifled innovation in the US. He also stressed the significance of pushing the legislative process.</p>



<p>The SEC didn&#8217;t only not provide clear rules but also seemed to try and stop the sector from getting clarity. As Garlinghouse said to Bloomberg in another interview, “For the SEC,<em> its overreach […] to say everything is a security. It is the first time the SEC has lost a crypto case. I think the SEC has been a bully and has gone after weak players who couldn’t mount a defence.”</em></p>



<p>When asked who should oversee crypto tokens, Garlinghouse admitted that there is a regulatory gap. He emphasized, however, that most of those working in the sector are builders who want to enhance the financial system and investigate alternative applications for blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. He noted that Ripple has focused on cross-border payments but anticipates various transformative use cases. Clear rules of the road, according to Garlinghouse, would encourage investment and allow entrepreneurs to flourish.</p>



<p>While the US lacked clarity, Garlinghouse said he was encouraged by developments overseas. He mentioned the UK&#8217;s proposed rules on crypto assets and highlighted the efforts of the European Union to create a unified framework through the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). He urged Congress to act but voiced irritation with the country&#8217;s lack of direction and leadership. While the regulatory certainty for XRP and Bitcoin is valuable, Garlinghouse stated that the lack of regulatory clarity for other digital assets is a matter of concern.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse concluded that Congress should take the court decision as a wake-up call to provide crypto with much-needed regulatory clarity. He hoped Washington would move forward since lawmakers like Tom Emmer were pressing for action.</p>



<p>In addition to being a significant victory for Ripple, the court ruling in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-not-a-security-crypto-lawyer-muses-about-lessons-from-telegram-case-for-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit/">SEC v. Ripple case</a> has wider ramifications for the whole crypto industry. It has highlighted the necessity of transparent policies that support investment and innovation while advising business owners.</p>



<p>The decision has called into question the SEC&#8217;s regulatory strategy and emphasized the significance of legislative action. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, has pleaded with Congress to seize this chance to offer regulatory certainty, stressing that the United States must take the lead in this field. The pressure on Congress to act has increased as other nations make strides in creating regulatory systems.</p>

<p>On July 13, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">Ripple Labs won part of its legal battle</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the Southern District of New York&#8217;s federal district court. Concerning programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges, Judge Analisa Torres found in favour of Ripple Labs, granted summary judgment, and found that the XRP is not a security. However, the SEC also had a win since the judge determined that XRP meets the requirements of the Howey Test, making it a security when offered to institutional investors.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-non-security-verdict-triggers-astounding-wave-but-theres-more-to-expect-next-from-ripple-and-sec/">price of XRP shot up by over 80%</a> and took other Altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Polygon with it, which all made impressive gains. With the partial loss of the SEC, especially with regards to crypto sales at exchanges not being classified as a security by Judge Torres, the question is how much will this influence other cases?</p>



<p>The SEC had previously declared that most cryptos other than Bitcoin are likely to be classed as securities; with the clarity that XRP has now received, observers look to cases such as SEC vs Coinbase.</p>



<p>James Murphy, also known as MetaLawMan, a popular crypto lawyer, said: <em>“While Judge Torres&#8217; decision is not &#8220;binding precedent&#8221; it is extremely well reasoned and will be cited in all motions to dismiss.”</em></p>



<p>This implies that the decision of Judge Torres may be persuasive and affect upcoming judicial cases involving the classification of XRP or other such coins. This could prove crucial for Coinbase in its defence against the SEC.</p>



<p>The SEC sued Coinbase claiming it served as a broker, an exchange, and a clearinghouse for unregistered securities. The SEC cited the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s Howey Test, a legal standard developed in the 1940s, supporting its argument that 13 cryptocurrencies listed on Coinbase satisfied its requirements.</p>



<p>The SEC will now have a hard time showing that Coinbase sold securities with Judge Torres confirming that XRP sales on exchanges are not more than mere asset sales where the buyer and seller don’t know each other, also called ‘blind sales’.</p>



<p>What is certainly something that other projects and altcoins have to pay attention to is the ruling in favour of the SEC, where the Judge argued that the initial sales to institutions and investors are securities because most ICOs under this ruling would be seen as selling unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Regarding Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini&#8217;s previous delisting of XRP, these exchanges have all stated that they intend to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/">relist XRP</a> or have already done so. This choice was made following a three-year suspension of token trading due to the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC.</p>



<p>The re-listing shows that these exchanges have changed their positions, maybe due to recent developments in the lawsuit or their evaluation of the XRP-related regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>As far as the old feud of the XRP Community with Charles Hoskinson is concerned, a tweet by the Cardano founder seemed to be quite reconciliatory. <em>“Well done XRP. One Small step for XRP Nation, one Giant leap for Cryptocurrencies!”</em> he said on Twitter.</p>

<p>After long delays, it seems Europe is finally preparing for the eagerly awaited launch of its first spot <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-spot-bitcoin-etf-could-turn-around-btcs-fortunes-says-galaxy-digitals-ceo/">Bitcoin</a> exchange-traded fund (ETF). It is anticipated that the ETF will launch in the coming months, offering interested European customers a different path to invest in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>The launch of the European ETF was previously planned for 2022, but delays and regulatory obstacles prevented that from happening. But current information from industry sources indicates that the rollout is finally approaching. The sponsors of the ETF, Swiss company 21Shares and WisdomTree, have stated their enthusiasm and dedication to bringing this innovative product to market.</p>



<p>Regulators, particularly the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which regulates financial markets throughout the European Union, are anticipated to give the ETF their OK. Although detailed information about the launch date and listing exchange have not yet been released, industry analysts believe it will probably happen soon.</p>



<p>Regulation-related difficulties and the requirement to address concerns about investor protection and market integrity are to blame for the ETF&#8217;s delayed launch. Despite the setbacks, industry participants are nonetheless upbeat about the prospects for Bitcoin ETFs in Europe. The successful launch of a regulated spot Bitcoin ETF, may pave the way for other possibilities to invest in digital assets and boost the institutional use of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The European <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> intends to meet the growing demand among European investors for exposure to Bitcoin as they carefully follow the events in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has denied all spot Bitcoin ETF applications so far. In response to prior attempts at a successful filing, the SEC has repeatedly stated that it can&#8217;t allow a spot Bitcoin ETF to proceed until one can show it will be appropriately structured to prevent fraud and manipulation, highlighting the need for investor protection.</p>



<p>The launch of a Bitcoin ETF in Europe before the US could herald a change in the cryptocurrency market environment. The European ETF&#8217;s popularity and performance could pressure US regulators to reconsider their position and offer a more specific path for Bitcoin ETFs in the nation. The prospective acceptance of a US Bitcoin ETF might significantly affect widespread adoption and strengthen cryptocurrencies&#8217; status as a class of investment asset.</p>



<p>The impending launch of Europe&#8217;s first Bitcoin ETF signifies an essential milestone in the cryptocurrency market. It shows a rising interest and need for regulated investment products in digital assets. The introduction of the European Bitcoin ETF is a step towards closing the gap between conventional finance and emerging cryptocurrencies, highlighting how Bitcoin is becoming more and more accepted as a real investment asset.</p>

<ul>
<li>XRP surged to new highs after a U.S. court ruled that the asset is not a security.</li>



<li>The token rose by nearly 70% in less than a day, with bulls hoping to break the $1 price point.</li>



<li>Despite the victory, there are fears that the securities watchdog may file an appeal against the ruling.</li>
</ul>



<p>Barely hours after its historic “victory”, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/">XRP became the fourth-largest crypto asset</a> with a market capitalization of over $40 billion, but there could be further trouble on the horizon.</p>



<p>XRP bulls are rubbing their hands in glee at the resurgence of the token after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">Ripple Labs scored a win</a> against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On July 13, the court ruled in summary judgment that the sale of XRP on exchanges did not meet the criteria for classification as an investment contract.</p>



<p>The judgment was accompanied by a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-makes-a-comeback-as-holders-bet-on-huge-upsurge-amid-ripples-groundbreaking-win-in-sec-lawsuit/">mass hysteria by the community</a> that buoyed the asset to a 52-week high of $0.8875. The value spike translates to a near 70% spike for XRP as bulls anticipate the asset class reaching $10.</p>



<p>Regarding transaction volumes, XRP has been a beehive of activity, recording over $10 billion in volume, a staggering 70% increase in under 24 hours. A contributory factor for the soaring value is the relisting of XRP on a clutch of exchanges, including Coinbase.</p>



<p>While the community continues to savour its hard-fought win, pundits have warned that the SEC could be heading on appeal. However, optimists argue that the chances of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the decision remains slim, given the antecedent of the apex court.</p>



<p>“The odds are even if they (SEC) wins at the appellate level, they’ll lose at the Supreme Court,” said ex-SEC adviser Justin Slaughter. “The Supreme Court has been very hostile to a bunch of agencies recently, on a host of issues from the APA to how staffing at agencies works.”</p>



<p>The SEC dragged Ripple Labs to court in December 2022, alleging that the firm and its executives had engaged in the sale of unregistered securities. Rather than reach a settlement with the SEC, Ripple Labs opted to slug it out in court in a case that spanned nearly three years.</p>



<p>The decision puts a dent in the SEC’s cases against Coinbase and Binance, revolving around facilitating the sale of unregistered securities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coast-is-not-yet-clear-for-ripple-labs"><strong>Coast is not yet clear for Ripple Labs</strong></h2>



<p>Although it was decided that XRP is not a security, the court ruled that the sale of the asset to institutional buyers violated U.S. capital market rules. It was discovered that the sale to institutional buyers may have netted Ripple Labs profits in excess of $600 million.</p>



<p>Ripple Labs faces another mountain to climb on the claims that its institutional sales amounted to an investment contract under the court’s litmus test.</p>



<p><em>“The most important part of the ruling is the Court found that your company broke the law and made illegal institutional sales,”</em> said U.S.-based lawyer Joe Carlasare. <em>“Your company made $700 million in unlawful profit. Good luck at the trial claiming ignorance of Howey.”</em></p>

<p>Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of Circle, operator of the USDC stablecoin, has expressed optimism about the development of Web3 in Hong Kong and the local monetary authority&#8217;s (HKMA) efforts to regulate stablecoins.</p>



<p>While acknowledging that mainland China is unlikely to open its markets to cryptocurrencies, Allaire believes that stablecoins could play a role in the internationalization of the yuan. Allaire stated in an interview with the South China Morning Post, <em>&#8220;If eventually the Chinese government wants to see the RMB used more freely in trade and commerce around the world, it may be that stablecoins are the path to do that more than the central bank digital currency.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Allaire highlighted the potential of stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, specifically mentioning a stablecoin pegged to the offshore yuan (CNH). He emphasized that stablecoins could offer a more immediate solution for the Chinese government&#8217;s goal of internationalizing the yuan compared to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>



<p>While some government officials in mainland China have shown support for Hong Kong&#8217;s efforts in the cryptocurrency industry, there is no indication that Beijing itself is warming up to crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-circle-in-favor-of-hk-regulations-hk-engaged-in-cross-border-trials"><strong>Circle in Favor of HK Regulations, HK Engaged in Cross-Border Trials</strong></h2>



<p>Hong Kong is positioning itself as a global virtual asset hub and is focusing on regulating stablecoins. The HKMA has committed to introducing regulations for stablecoins by 2024, recognizing their potential impact on financial markets.</p>



<p>The Securities and Futures Commission is also working on complementary regulations for stablecoins. Circle&#8217;s USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin after Tether (USDT), is considered a regulated stablecoin issuer, and the company is encouraged by the HKMA&#8217;s prioritization of stablecoin regulations.</p>



<p>While central banks worldwide have expressed concerns about stablecoins&#8217; impact on financial stability, the HKMA has proposed that the value of reserve assets should always match the value of outstanding stablecoins as a mitigating measure. The HKMA is also researching the possibility of a digital Hong Kong dollar and is participating in a cross-border trial of the eCNY using blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Allaire believes that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and private stablecoins can coexist in a well-regulated environment. He sees CBDCs as a means for central banks to upgrade their systems but believes that private sector innovation on the public internet is distinct and valuable. Circle has a significant presence in Asia, with approximately 125 employees in the region, making it their largest non-US market.</p>



<p><em>“We’re excited that this is a priority for the Hong Kong government and it seems like it’s a real priority for the HKMA,”</em> Allaire added. <em>“That’s tremendously positive and is really motivating for us to want to be able to grow our business here.”</em></p>



<p>The regulatory initiatives and focus on stablecoins in Hong Kong align with Circle&#8217;s business goals, and the company is motivated to grow its presence in the region. Allaire&#8217;s positive outlook on stablecoins and the regulatory environment in Hong Kong demonstrates the potential for continued development and adoption of digital assets in the global financial landscape.</p>

<p>In 2021, Kraken had seemingly received a summons from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), but the exchange did not conform with the order. The IRS now intends to look into the tax liabilities of customers who used the platform to transact in cryptocurrencies between 2016 and 2020. Previously Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) had reached settlement on SEC allegations of securities law violations connected to Krakens staking service.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency exchange must now provide the IRS with access to account and transaction data under an injunction issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The IRS claimed that it required the data to identify any Kraken users who may have underreported their taxes.</p>



<p>In accordance with the decree, Kraken must divulge details regarding customers who transacted more over $20,000 in a single calendar year. This data consists of genuine or made-up names, birthdates, taxpayer identification numbers, addresses, contact details (phone and email), and other relevant data.</p>



<p>However, it appears that Kraken made every effort to protect its clients from the reach of the law. Crypto News outlet CryptoSlate claimed it had information on the matter and according to a statement obtained by the outlet Kraken said <em>“We fought the IRS because they sought intrusive and unnecessary information about U.S. clients… Were this information leaked by the IRS, it would expose Kraken clients to identity theft and other harm, which Kraken prevented.”</em></p>



<p>Users who transacted in cryptocurrencies beyond predetermined thresholds and during predetermined times were required to give Kraken their names and other identifying information. The Court, however, denied the IRS request for more Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) information, including job details, net worth, and wealth source.</p>



<p>The Kraken representative thanked the Court for rejecting many of the IRS&#8217;s demands since they thought the IRS&#8217;s first demands were too broad. Citing its successful defense in this case, the exchange emphasized its dedication to consumer security and privacy and pledged to constantly speak out for its clients.</p>



<p>Judge Joseph C. Spero said in the June 30th order <em>“The Government has a legitimate purpose for seeking the materials described in the summon. As discussed above, the summons was issued in connection with an investigation by the IRS to determine the identity and correct federal income tax liability of U.S. persons who conducted transactions in cryptocurrency during the period 2016-2020.”</em></p>



<p>The actions by both the SEC and the IRS are in line with what many see as an attack on the crypto industry in the United States. Many influential figures such as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse have vowed to leave the US if the anti-crypto climate persists. Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom have all been much more crypto friendly and try to position themselves as crypto hubs.</p>

<p>The CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, has continued to sing Bitcoin’s praises. Fink spoke about the growing demand he is witnessing for cryptocurrencies among gold clients in the Friday interview, asserting that crypto will, in the future, “transcend any one currency.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-larry-fink-sees-immense-crypto-demand-from-gold-investors"><strong>Larry Fink Sees Immense Crypto Demand From Gold Investors</strong></h2>



<p>BlackRock boss Larry Fink sees a future where crypto serves as a universal asset.</p>



<p>During a Friday interview with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Fink <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html">stated </a>that while he couldn’t talk about Bitcoin specifically as BlackRock had filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for permission to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, cryptocurrencies have “a differentiating value versus other asset classes.”</p>



<p>BlackRock, which is the world’s biggest asset manager with nearly $10 trillion — submitted its application for a spot crypto ETF last month, prompting institutional investors to pour capital into the sector and subsequently sparking a bull run that propelled Bitcoin to $12-month highs.</p>



<p>The BlackRock chief told <em>CNBC </em>that “more and more” gold investors had been enquiring about the role of crypto over the past five years, underscoring the role ETFs have had in democratizing access to gold, as they could do in crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moment Of Validation For Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Larry Fink further observed that crypto is an international asset that has the potential to eclipse any other currency, as it is not linked to any particular country or government.</p>



<p>“More importantly, because it’s so international, it’s going to transcend any one currency in currency valuation,” he postulated, adding that an “international crypto product” can “transcend” the problem of dollar devaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SEC had already approved a couple of futures Bitcoin ETFs back in 2021. However, the securities regulator has declined to greenlight a spot Bitcoin ETF which would give more institutional investors access to BTC without the hassle of storage. This year alone, nearly half a dozen institutional giants, including the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, BitWise, and WisdomTree have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">filed </a>fresh spot Bitcoin ETF applications in hopes of finally becoming the first to launch such an investment vehicle in the United States.</p>



<p>These applicants included vital surveillance-sharing agreements in their filings, which could prove to be the deciding factor in the SEC finally okaying their spot BTC ETFs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are working with our regulators because, as in any new market, if BlackRock’s name is going to be on it, we’re going to make sure that it’s safe and sound and protected,” Fink said during the CNBC interview.</p>



<p>Just last week, BlackRock’s Fink <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-highly-optimistic-on-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-as-ceo-larry-fink-terms-bitcoin-an-international-asset/">admitted </a>that contrary to his opinion a few years ago, he now sees Bitcoin as “digitizing gold” and that it could “revolutionize finance”.</p>



<p>Validation from the leader of the biggest asset manager in the world could help with mass adoption, further entrenching Bitcoin in mainstream usage and public consciousness.</p>

<p>According to JPMorgan, the key court ruling going partially in favor of blockchain payments firm Ripple marks a monumental win for the entire crypto industry and provides clarity on what does and doesn’t qualify as a security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-giant-win-for-crypto-industry"><strong>One Giant Win For Crypto Industry</strong></h2>



<p>On Thursday, federal district judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">ruled </a>that XRP token purchases via exchanges were not securities transactions. The decision was cheered by the crypto community and market observers like JPMorgan, who feel the outcome will help create more regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>“This ruling is undoubtedly a milestone win for the industry. It provides legal clarity and defense around what does and does not constitute a security, and that overall outcome is in favor of what many in the industry had been arguing,” strategists at JPMorgan said in a research report Friday.</p>



<p>The analysts noted that the lack of clear rules of the road had pushed large capital pools to the sidelines and also “slowed innovation, adoption, and just overall crypto ecosystem valuation”.</p>



<p>Notably, some digital asset exchanges had previously paused trading of XRP after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claimed that it was a security in December 2020. The regulator at the time <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">filed </a>a suit against the blockchain platform and its executives CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen alleging failure to register XRP as security before offering over $1.2 billion worth of tokens to the public. Exchanges including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/krakenpro/status/1679582922347520002">Kraken</a>, BitStamp, and <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1679680507871633408">Crypto.com</a> have now rushed to make XRP available to U.S. users again in the wake of the court ruling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not Over Yet?</strong></h2>



<p>Although Ripple’s victory is incredibly bullish, the bank’s analysts believe the fight for regulatory clarity is not yet over. This is because the SEC will likely appeal the decision to the 2nd Circuit and can also continue to launch similar cases in the future.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, they think the crypto industry “has now established stronger ground for the time being, which could affect ongoing cases, and also the pace of further litigation, but at a high level, we do not think the regulatory overhang simply disappears, it just lessens.”</p>



<p>After a parabolic rally following the verdict, XRP’s price took a 7.5% tumble to settle around $0.72 at the time of publication. The fifth-biggest crypto is now back below BNB Coin (BNB) after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-overtakes-bnb-coin-as-fourth-most-valuable-crypto-as-coinbase-announces-relisting/">briefly surpassing</a> it, CoinGecko data shows.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially recognized <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-renewed-bitcoin-etf-application-featuring-coinbase-raises-questions-on-secs-scrutiny/">BlackRock’s recent spot Bitcoin ETF application</a>. As seen on its official website, the regulatory body acknowledged the ETF filing from BlackRock in a section dedicated to ETFs filed during the third quarter of the year.</p>



<p>Along with BlackRock, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs-wont-be-a-game-changer-for-crypto-industry-jpmorgan-strategists-opine/">SEC</a> also acknowledged other applications sent in by a handful of other leading asset managers. Applications from Fidelity, WisdomTreeFunds, VanEck, Galaxy Digital, Invesco US were also posted on the site.</p>



<p>It is noteworthy that Bitcoin ETF applications filed by leading investment firms like ARK Invest, 21Shares, and Bitwise Invest have already passed this stage.</p>



<p>Key figures in the cryptocurrency market have responded to the recent development. Market players have collectively shared positive sentiments regarding the update on the SEC’s website.</p>



<p>James Seyffrat, a research analyst covering Crypto and Bitcoin relation stories for Bloomberg, seems to think the market is already off to a good start. “We’re off to the races,&#8221; he asserted, adding that Valkyrie Funds’ application is next in line.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UPDATE: There they are &#8212; SEC just acknowledged the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF applications for <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackRock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vaneck_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vaneck_us</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/InvescoUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@InvescoUS</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/GalaxyDigital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GalaxyDigital</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Fidelity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fidelity</a>, &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/WisdomTreeFunds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WisdomTreeFunds</a>.

</div></figure>



<p>It bears mentioning that this is only one of many steps required for ETF applications to be recognized by the SEC. However, the steps are not determining factors in the approval process.</p>



<p>As Seyffrat explained; </p>



<p><em>“Gotta expect ValkyrieFunds&#8217;s application to be acknowledged on ~Monday based on recent trends. Also &#8212; as I said yesterday this is just a step in the process and does *NOT* mean these will be approved. Just that the official process has begun.”</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, anticipation for the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF has intensified following news that Europe is preparing to launch its first spot Bitcoin ETF. According to Jacobi Asset Management, the asset manager responsible for the Bitcoin ETF listing, the ETF is set to go live this July.</p>



<p>The asset manager first received approval for its application in 2021 but failed to launch the ETF due to unfavourable market conditions. After 12 months, the asset manager is ready to meet market demands, which it claims have “shifted since last summer”.</p>



<p>On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETF applications are still pending. Although market players are not certain how long it will take to get a response from the SEC, a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-spot-bitcoin-etf-could-turn-around-btcs-fortunes-says-galaxy-digitals-ceo/">prominent figure</a> in the market is convinced that the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF could be significantly favourable for Bitcoin’s price.</p>
