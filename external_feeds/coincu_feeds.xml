<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance announces that the 24th BNB burn has been completed.</em></li>



<li><em>During the second quarter of 2023, a total of 1,991,854 BNB were burned, with a value of $484.1 million.</em></li>



<li><em>This could be a welcome sign in the downtrend of BNB over the past three months.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cryptocurrency exchange Binance <a href="https://t.co/3OMUccAWId" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conducted</a> the 24th quarterly BNB burn. Specifically, during the second quarter of 2023 burned, a total of 1,991,854 BNB were burned, with the value converted to $484.1 million.</strong></h5>

<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added that although the BNB burn has been done, there will still be some other large transactions to be done to &#8220;allocate/distribute coins to multiple addresses&#8221;. It is not clear why Binance had to make such transactions, which were not recorded in previous burns.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The quarterly <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BNB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#BNB</a> burn is done, according to the public algorithm. <br><br>I was told there will be some more on-chain (large) transactions shortly, to further distribute/spread the coins to more addresses.

</div></figure>



<p>Burning BNB is a recurring activity performed by Binance every quarter, as mentioned in the BNB whitepaper. Since the beginning of 2022, the exchange has actively burned the amount of BNB until the total supply is reduced to only 100 million coins.</p>



<p>This could be a good signal to keep the<a href="https://coincu.com/201680-bnb-price-is-struggling-at-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> BNB price</a> from falling too much in a volatile market. BNB, in the last three months, lost more than 25% as Binance was hit by a wave of negative news globally, especially with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit and FUDs related to the Executive departures and layoffs have also caused the exchange&#8217;s native token to fluctuate wildly.</p>



<p>In addition, BNB is still at risk of facing more than $200 million worth of liquidation on the Venus protocol if the price drops to $220. This amount of money has been sealed from the BNB Bridge attack in October 2022 but has yet to be resolved by the BNB Chain community.</p>



<p>Recently, however, there is a dynamic that makes BNB more attractive. On July 18, Binance also successfully held a Launchpad sale for Arkham Intelligence (ARKM), attracting more than 114,000 users to participate and lock up $2.4 billion worth of BNB.</p>

<p>In the last 24 hours, XRP was the best performer among the top 25 crypto assets, gaining 3.6%. It regained its position as the fourth-largest digital asset by market value, surpassing Binance&#8217;s BNB token.</p>



<p>However, Bitcoin and Ether have not fared as well and are now trading below their levels from last Thursday, both below their important price levels at $30,000 and $1,900, respectively.</p>



<p>Despite giving back some of the gains from last Thursday, XRP has still seen a 60% increase since the ruling. On the other hand, the Crypto Market Index, which monitors the performance of the broader digital asset market, has lost all of its Thursday advance, recording a 0.5% decrease over the same period.</p>

<p>Top altcoins like Polygon&#8217;s MATIC, Solana&#8217;s SOL, and Cardano&#8217;s ADA, which experienced significant rallies last Thursday, have reversed to the levels where they traded before the XRP ruling. MATIC and SOL are down 5% over the week, while ADA dropped 2%.</p>



<p>According to David Lawant, the Head of Research at institutional crypto exchange FalconX, the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit did not generate a more comprehensive and enduring rally in crypto. Although the rush to purchase XRP has subsided, the token&#8217;s inclusion in digital asset funds could represent some buying pressure that boosts its price. Lawant said, &#8220;Index funds are one potential source of additional institutional flow I’m still watching.&#8221;</p>

<p>The platform also offers smaller rewards for identifying corporate addresses belonging to firms such as Grayscale, MicroStrategy, and Bitwise. In total, the Intel Exchange offers 204,250 ARKM of bounty rewards worth about $134,539 at current market prices. It is currently unclear whether these rewards may be paid out to multiple individuals or repeatedly for every identified address, and the true amount on offer may be significantly higher.</p>

<p>While the Intel Exchange has the potential to uncover important hacks and illegal activities, the platform has received significant backlash. Many believe that the platform may be primarily used to &#8220;dox&#8221; individuals or reveal private information. However, Arkham leaders have previously emphasized that the marketplace is intended to uncover exploits and fraud. At present, most of the available bounties appear to have been created by an &#8220;Arkham Admin&#8221; rather than general users.</p>

<p>PleasrDAO is an art collective that collects and manages NFTs. PleasrDAO&#8217;s thesis is to collect works of cultural significance, often related to philanthropic activities. PleasrDAO was initially organized on Twitter in March 2021 in order to purchase Pplpleasr&#8217;s genesis Non-Fungible Token (NFT).</p>



<p>The organization is comprised of artists, NFT collectors, and DeFi leaders, and together they have achieved the reputation of being called an &#8220;art collector&#8217;s empire.&#8221; Each member of the DAO holds a token that represents a portion of the team&#8217;s treasury and has an equal voice in the group&#8217;s decision-making.</p>



<p>The DAO was initiated by PoolTogether co-founder Leighton Cusack in March 2021. Other team members include Alex Svanevik, CEO of crypto data platform Nansen, Calvin Liu of Compound, Tarun Chitra of Gauntlet Network and Andrew Kang of Mechanism Capital.</p>



<p>PleasrDAO&#8217;s collection includes many notable NFT pieces, including Edward Snowden&#8217;s Stay Free.</p>

<li><em>IRS identifies around 100 cases for potential criminal investigation.</em></li>



<li><em>The probe targets residency requirements and income source accuracy.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/irs-probe-of-100-wealthy-americans-gets-boost-from-puerto-rico#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, Puerto Rico&#8217;s top economic development official, Manuel Cidre, has revealed that he is actively cooperating with US tax authorities in their investigation into approximately 100 high-income individuals who are suspected of misusing Puerto Rico&#8217;s tax incentive program to evade federal taxes.</strong></h5>

<p>Cidre, the Secretary of Economic Development and Commerce in Puerto Rico, stated that his office has been collaborating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since 2021 to identify individuals who may be abusing the island&#8217;s lucrative tax breaks. The IRS has already identified around 100 people who have failed to meet the program&#8217;s rules, and it anticipates that many of these cases will proceed to criminal investigation.</p>



<p>Puerto Rico has been offering attractive tax incentives to hedge fund managers, cryptocurrency traders, and other wealthy individuals for over a decade, attracting thousands of Americans to the US territory. Under the program, qualified individuals can avoid paying federal income tax and enjoy exemptions on dividend, interest, and capital gains income. However, to be eligible, participants must spend a minimum of 183 days per year in Puerto Rico, and their income from the mainland is still subject to federal taxes.</p>

<p>Ensuring compliance with the rules and regulations of the tax incentive program has become a priority for Manuel Cidre. He emphasized that his office has expelled over 300 individuals from the program since 2021, reflecting the government&#8217;s commitment to ensuring the program&#8217;s integrity.</p>



<p>Recently, US prosecutors and IRS agents have taken action by deploying undercover agents and closely scrutinizing records to build criminal and civil cases against wealthy individuals suspected of illicitly exploiting Puerto Rico&#8217;s tax breaks. Investigators are focusing on potential cases where individuals may have lied about their time spent on the island and the sources of their income. In addition to targeting individuals, authorities are also examining the promoters, attorneys, and accountants involved in marketing the tax program. It is expected that at least two criminal investigations, including one involving a US lawyer, will result in charges in the near future.</p>



<p>While the IRS claims to have identified 100 individuals under investigation, some experts in tax law remain skeptical of the agency&#8217;s statement. They argue that determining eligibility for the benefits of Puerto Rico&#8217;s tax code is a complex matter and requires careful evaluation.</p>



<p>Since 2012, more than 5,000 Americans have qualified for the tax incentives offered in Puerto Rico, allowing them to legally avoid paying federal income tax and enjoy tax exemptions on various types of income. An additional 3,600 businesses benefit from tax exemptions on earnings and profits, with a 4% tax applied to export services. However, the program&#8217;s rigorous residency requirements have raised concerns about potential fraudulent practices. To qualify, individuals must establish a &#8220;closer connection&#8221; to Puerto Rico than to the US and demonstrate that the island is their &#8220;tax home.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the investigation unfolds, the cooperation between Puerto Rico&#8217;s economic development office and US tax authorities underscores the commitment to ensuring the integrity and proper use of the tax incentive program.</p>



<p>Puerto Rico <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/02/27/2616418/0/en/Puerto-Rico-Issues-Clarifying-Guidance-Staking-as-a-Service-Eligible-Service-for-4-Tax-Rate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extended</a> its 4% tax break to crypto assets and blockchain activities, including staking, in March. Blockchain technology, blockchain-based digital assets, and blockchain validation (the process of reaching a consensus on valid transactions) will now be covered by the incentive code.</p>

<p>During an event organized by the Heal-the-Divide PAC, Kennedy <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeConsorti/status/1681491870436687872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> his Bitcoin-focused policies that he intends to implement if elected president. His plan includes gradually backing the dollar with <a href="https://coincu.com/203690-bitcoin-etf-may-not-bring-the-new-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> and eliminating capital gains taxes on earnings from the cryptocurrency. The goal is to restore the strength of the dollar and promote financial stability in the United States.</p>



<p>Kennedy&#8217;s proposal centers around a return to a solid currency foundation in America. He outlined his plan to start with a small allocation, perhaps 1% of issued Treasury bills, backed by hard assets such as gold, silver, platinum, or Bitcoin. Depending on the success of this initial phase, he intends to gradually increase the allocation over time.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“My plan would be to start very, very small, perhaps 1% of issued T-bills would be backed by hard currency, by gold, silver platinum or Bitcoin,” Kennedy said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By backing the U.S. dollar and debt obligations with hard assets like BTC, Kennedy believed it could rejuvenate the strength of the dollar, control inflation, and usher in a new era of financial stability and prosperity for the country. In addition to the backing of the dollar, Kennedy proposes eliminating capital gains taxes on Bitcoin earnings, aiming to incentivize investment, boost innovation, protect privacy, and encourage businesses to grow within the United States rather than abroad.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/180215-robert-kennedy-backs-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kennedy&#8217;s Bitcoin-oriented policies</a> have garnered attention and debate. Supporters argue that backing the dollar with BTC could strengthen the economy, attract investment, and serve as a prudent policy tool to ensure fiscal longevity. They see it as an opportunity to position the United States at the forefront of the cryptocurrency sector. However, critics express concerns about the risks and volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. They caution that backing the dollar with BTC could introduce instability and increase the likelihood of an economic crisis.</p>

Kennedy Jr. Reveals Desire To Back Dollar With Bitcoin And Eliminate Crypto Tax 27"></a></figure></div>


<p>In addition to the economic implications, Kennedy&#8217;s proposals align with his vision for a free and equitable nation. He aims to safeguard the right to self-custody of BTC, support personal node operation, and advocate for industry-neutral energy regulation. Drawing inspiration from his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, he seeks to govern a country that values hard currency and recognizes the potential pitfalls of fiat currency, such as funding wars without public approval.</p>



<p>As the presidential campaign unfolds, Kennedy&#8217;s Bitcoin-oriented policies reflect the evolving landscape of digital currencies and their potential impact on economic systems. The proposal not only explores the backing of the dollar with BTC but also touches on broader issues of financial stability, innovation, and privacy.</p>
