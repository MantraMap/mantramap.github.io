										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Georgetown, Cayman Islands, July 12th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kava.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kava</a>, a Layer-1 blockchain that combines the developer power of Ethereum with the speed and interoperability of Cosmos has launched the Kava 14 upgrade. This upgrade deploys &lsquo;internal bridge&rsquo; technology to seamlessly convert native Cosmos assets to and from Ethereum&rsquo;s ERC20 token standard.</p>
<p>Kava 14 is one of a cluster of milestones in the making. In early July, Tether announced it&rsquo;s decision to make Kava the gateway for issuing native USDt on Cosmos. With the launch of Kava 14, USDt can now be minted and easily converted on Cosmos, to &mdash; and from &mdash; USDt on every other L1 with native USDt including the: Bitcoin (Omni &amp; Liquid protocol), Ethereum, TRON networks, and more.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Within the first few days of Kava launching the official Tether integration, more USDt has been issued on Cosmos than on Polkadot and Near combined,&rdquo; said Scott Stuart, Kava Co-Founder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that people want USDt on the interchain. I&rsquo;m optimistic that having a native stablecoin and a safe, reliable way to convert it across chains via the Kava 14 upgrade will finally unlock the incredible tech the Cosmos ecosystem has built.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Kava Gains Momentum</h2>
<p>Following Tether&rsquo;s July announcement, Kucoin now supports Kava&rsquo;s Cosmos and EVM networks, providing a reliable CEX for user transactions within the Cosmos ecosystem. Meanwhile, Curve Finance&rsquo;s launch of a USDt liquidity pool offers a decentralized alternative for experienced users. In parallel, Stargate, a top omnichain liquidity layer, is set to launch on Kava, anticipating increased usage and liquidity. This expansion comes after a governance proposal that plans to widen the scope of the Kava Rise incentive fund.</p>
<p>The Kava 14 upgrade is a leap forward for Cosmos&nbsp;DeFi builders and users providing a safer, more secure, and more reliable method for converting assets to and from the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>

<li>At press time, Conflux (CFX) token was trading at $0.1981, up 10% in the last 24 hours.</li>
<li>Conflux Network partnered with China Telecom to develop a Blockchain-powered SIM card (BSIM) in May 2023.</li>
<li>The Bank of China will start testing of SIM card-linked payments using the digital yuan.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bank of China declared on July 10 that it would begin testing SIM card-linked payments using the digital Yuan on July 11. The announcement has boosted <a href="https://coinjournal.net/conflux/">Conflux (CFX) price</a> seeing that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/china-telecom-and-conflux-network-to-pilot-blockchain-enabled-sim-card-in-hong-kong/">Conflux Network partnered with China Telecom</a> to develop a Blockchain-powered SIM card (BSIM). In May 2023, the two <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/conflux-and-china-telecom-debut-first-on-chain-interaction-with-blockchain-sim-card/">unveiled their jointly developed BSIM card</a> at the Xuhui District West Bank Artificial Intelligence Center in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The state-owned bank asserted in its statement that it is implementing this programme in conjunction with telecom behemoths China Telecom and China Unicom. With the help of the near-field communication protocol (NFC) and &ldquo;super SIM cards&rdquo; technology, the project aims to make payments possible.</p>
<p>Users will essentially be able to process digital Yuan payments by making contact with designated payment terminals with their mobile phones.</p>
<h2>Excitement among the Conflux community</h2>
<p>The CFX community now believe the Conflux Network will have a big impact on the new SIM Card e-CNY payment system. This enthusiasm resulted in a rise in price, which increased by 10% this morning to reach a high of $0.2046.</p>
<p>Prior to the announcement, the CFX token was experiencing a seven-day price decline that saw it slip from $0.197 to $0.175.</p>

<li>Atlantic Equities downgraded Coinbase stock to &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; on Wednesday.</li>
<li>Cathie Wood also trimmed her stake in the crypto exchange today.</li>
<li>Coinbase stock is currently up more than 150% versus the start of 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investors should pull out of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase Global Inc</a> now that it&rsquo;s rallied more than 150% since the start of this year, says Simon Clinch &ndash; an Atlantic Equities analyst.</p>
<h2>Coinbase stock has downside to $80</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, Clinch downgraded the crypto exchange to &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;. His $80 price target warns of a 10% downside from its previous close.</p>
<p>In his research note, the analyst cited valuation and ongoing regulatory scrutiny as reasons for turning dovish on Coinbase stock.</p>
<blockquote><p>The risk/reward looks less attractive at this level given continued regulatory challenges ahead and the surprisingly weak volume backdrop.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase Global Inc last month for violating the U.S. securities laws. The Nasdaq-listed firm also added an <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-adds-instant-messaging-feature-to-wallet/">instant messaging</a> feature to its wallet on Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Cathie Wood trims her stake in Coinbase</h2>
<p>Clinch recommends moving to the sidelines in Coinbase stock also because the USDC market cap has declined which will affect the company&rsquo;s interest income.</p>
<blockquote><p>With these factors in mind, we&rsquo;re concerned the outlook for rest of FY23 may have deteriorated incrementally despite strength in crypto asset prices over the past month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase Global Inc is expected to lose 84 cents a share in its current financial quarter versus $4.95 per share a year ago.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, famed investor <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/07/33193286/cathie-woods-ark-offloads-12m-worth-of-bitcoin-linked-stock-amid-10-rally-on-cboe-tie-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cathie Wood</a> trimmed her stake in the crypto exchange. Her flagship Ark Innovation ETF sold 135,152 shares of Coinbase for roughly $12 million.</p>

<li>Coinbase Wallet now supports instant messaging across any two Ethereum addresses.</li>
<li>The feature will leverage the XMTP protocol and offer encrypted and private wallet-to-wallet communication and crypto payments.</li>
<li>Coinbase is rolling out the feature to a small subset of users first before expanding it.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> has introduced a new feature that allows for instant messaging between two wallet addresses for users of Coinbase Wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog post</a> the company published on July 12 stated that the messaging capability will utilise a built-in system powered by Extensible Message Transport Protocol (XMTP). With this feature users can now tap into all-in-one messaging and payments, which includes gas-free USDC transfers on Polygon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To send any of the crypto assets that Coinbase Wallet supports, users will simply need to start a chat.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Encrypted and private messaging</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The wallet-to-wallet messaging will be fully encrypted, private and portable, Sid Coelho-Prabhu, Director of Product Management at Coinbase, wrote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wallet-to-wallet messaging is here. <a href="https://t.co/vfM8RCdy65">pic.twitter.com/vfM8RCdy65</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Users can connect directly through their <a href="https://coinjournal.net/wallets/">wallets</a>, and will be able to take conversations and chat histories across other XMTP compatible apps. Coinbase Wallet is rolling out the messaging feature to a small group of users first, including those of Web3 social platform Lens protocol.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One needs access to the Coinbase Wallet mobile app to get started. They also need a .lens account, or should have an invitation sent via QR code. If one has used other XMTP apps, including Orb and Lenster, they will find all their chats in their Coinbase Wallet inbox.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has been trading around the $30k region for the last two weeks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s first presale stage is more than 70% completed as more investors enter the project.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been stable over the past few days, with the prices of most coins and tokens within a particular range. Will Bitcoin and the broader market rally higher in the near term, or would the market face a retrace?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin maintains its price above $30k</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, continues to trade just above the $30k mark. BTC has been trading around that range for the past three weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $30,468, down by less than 1% in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The performance comes after the consumer price index rose 0.2% in June and was up 3% from a year ago. The data indicated that inflation in the United States rose 0.2% last month, less than expected as consumers get a break from price increases.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the price pullback earlier today, the cryptocurrency market has performed excellently so far this year. Bitcoin is up by nearly 50% year-to-date, outperforming the other major asset classes in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the market in a positive mood, investors could be looking to get in on new projects. One of the projects to consider could be Chancer.&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> is a unique Web3 peer-to-peer (P2P) custom betting platform designed to enable users to live stream betting events.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer seeks to differentiate itself from other betting platforms by adopting a decentralised method of operations. On Chancer, users can bet on a wide range of events, beyond traditional sports and casino bets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the moment, the project is still in its stage one presale, with an aim of raising $1 million. Chancer developers will use the funds to build a P2P betting platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Chancer, players would enjoy excellent features such as betting markets in real-time and based on user interests, social media connections, and expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Chancer, users might no longer face the challenges associated with using bookmakers. The platform would allow users to set up their custom P2P betting markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps the biggest selling point of Chancer is that users can bet on a wide range of things, beyond the sporting and casino bets found on traditional betting platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the sport and casino bets would be available, Chancer users can et on any event they desire, whether mainstream or made-up. It doesn&rsquo;t matter the event, users can bet on them on the platform</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s presale is over 70% completed</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s stage one presale could be completed soon as the team has raised more than 70% of the required funds. At the moment,&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> has raised more than $700k, accounting for more than 70% of the required funds in stage one.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The development team has earmarked the funds to develop its suite of products. The team intends to carry out 12 presale events, with a target of $15 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chancer ecosystem would be powered by CHANCER, its native token. CHANCER is going for $0.01 BUSD per token, but its price could increase once the token launches on cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">CHANCER would power the various activities on the betting platforms. Token holders would be allowed to create markets and invest in markets created by other users.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, by holding CHANCER, users can create, participate in, and profit from their very own predictive markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presale is open to everyone, and Chancer supports a wide range of wallets, including, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Visit the Chancer website</u></a> to get more information about the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Chancer today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been stagnant over the past week, with prices of Bitcoin and other major coins and tokens ranging within specific prices. However, Bitcoin is up by nearly 50% year-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As more retail and institutional investors enter the market, Bitcoin&rsquo;s value could increase in the medium to long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors would be looking at new projects with strong fundamentals, and&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> could be one of the tokens to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a decentralised betting platform, Chancer could gain huge adoption in the Web3 ecosystem and beyond. Chancer is still in its presale stage and could provide huge value for investors in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

<li>At press time, LBRY Token had plunged to $0.009298 from a high of $0.01235 on July 11.</li>
<li>The plunge followed a ruling that LBRY Inc. violated US securities laws.</li>
<li>LBRY Inc. has stated that it is shutting down its business.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LBRY Credits (LBC) fell by 24% early today as a result of a Federal Judge&rsquo;s ruling that LBRY, Inc, the company that created the LBRY protocol, is responsible for breaking US securities laws. . LBRY was <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/sec-sues-crypto-startup-lbry-over-unregistered-securities/">sued by the SEC in March 2021</a> for offering unregistered securities.</p>
<p>Following the final judgment, the company is permanently prohibited from selling unregistered securities unless it first registers with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). LBRY, Inc also has thirty days to pay a fine of $111,614.</p>
<h2>Winding LBRY Inc. down</h2>
<p>After the ruling, the decentralized content-sharing project LBRY Inc. was quick to announce its next steps stating that it working on winding down completely.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The final judgement in SEC vs LBRY is out.</p>
<p>In accordance with the court's order and our promises, we expect to spend the next several months winding LBRY Inc. down entirely.</p>
<p>As to what happens to LBRY from here, well, that's up to you. <a href="https://t.co/cU8O3nATT6">pic.twitter.com/cU8O3nATT6</a></p>
<p>&mdash; LBRY &#128640; (@LBRYcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/LBRYcom/status/1678866789407551489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to note that the SEC never requested a total shutdown of the project, at least not in their initial complaint, despite the project&rsquo;s announcement that it is closing. On the contrary, the regulator sought to prevent unregistered securities offerings of any kind and the return of &ldquo;ill-gotten&rdquo; profits from those activities, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC cited explicit statements on LBRY&rsquo;s website that it was selling LBRY Credits (LBC) tokens to &ldquo;financially support its operations&rdquo; both through their protocol and on secondary markets, which refer to the buying and selling of tokens on platforms that aren&rsquo;t the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s original issuers. These statements were made during the litigation process.</p>
<h2>Last year&rsquo;s ruling against LBRY</h2>
<p>In November last year, Judge Paul J. Barbadoro of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire ruled against LBRY Inc. ruling that the project could not provide &ldquo;any reasonable trier of fact that could reject the SEC&rsquo;s claims.&rdquo; As a result, LBRY Inc. declared they lost.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/lbry-credits-lbc-shoots-up-by-90-after-being-declared-not-a-security/">LBRY Inc. filed and won an appea</a>l focusing on whether the secondary market sales of the LBC tokens should be included in an injunction the US SEC is seeking the court to approve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After yesterday&rsquo;s ruling, the company&rsquo;s CEO, Jeremy Kauffman, tweeted that &ldquo;neither the SEC nor the federal judge himself can tell me what the law allows and doesn&rsquo;t allow,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;all I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do is follow the law.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tortola, British Virgin Islands, July 12th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p>In its ongoing journey to reshape the crypto investing landscape, Struct Finance, a DeFi platform that enables investors to engage with tailored interest rate products linked to digital assets, is thrilled to announce the launch of the BTC.B-USDC Vaults.</p>
<p>The tranche-based BTC.B-USDC Interest Rate Product was made possible by effectively leveraging Avalanche&rsquo;s BTC.B (Bridged Bitcoin) for DeFi applications. The new vault beautifully complements Struct Finance&rsquo;s Genesis USDC Vaults, heralding an exciting era in DeFi yield opportunities. Struct Finance built the new vault on top of GMX&rsquo;s Liquidity Provider Token (GLP) to generate predictable yields for BTC in the form of fixed returns, and USDC in the form of variable returns, while still leveraging a secure asset and minimizing volatility and exposure to other risks.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our BTC.B-USDC Vaults represent an innovative application of Bitcoin in DeFi. We&rsquo;re taking full advantage of Avalanche&rsquo;s Bridged Bitcoin (BTC.B) to bring about a fresh wave of opportunities in the digital asset space,&rdquo; said Ersin Dalkali, the Co-founder of Struct Finance.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Bitcoin continues to dominate the market, its inherent lack of a DeFi layer has traditionally made native yield generation quite challenging. Avalanche has unlocked new possibilities for Bitcoin in DeFi with BTC.B (Bridged Bitcoin). Unlike WBTC that relied on centralized bridges, BTC.B is minted via Avalanche Core &mdash; a decentralized bridge &mdash; and can be trustlessly bridged across networks using the Layer Zero bridge.</p>
<p>At present, Bitcoin investments in prominent lending pools yield between 0.2&ndash;0.5%. Even the stable swap pools offering wBTC-BTC.B products only manage to deliver returns of about 2%. Struct&rsquo;s BTC.B-USDC product shatters these limitations, offering significantly higher yields.</p>
<p>The purpose of BTC.B is to empower BTC holders to explore DeFi opportunities on the Avalanche blockchain, without the need to acquire secondary tokens or rely on centralized bridges. BTC.B represents BTC coins transferred to the Avalanche blockchain in the form of ERC-20 tokens. With over 6000 BTC bridged and a fully diluted value of $180 million, BTC.B is carving a niche for itself in the crypto arena.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Invesco &ndash; three of the world&rsquo;s leading asset managers &ndash; are not just a mere submission. It is a signal that the traditional financial realm is ready to embrace Bitcoin on a new level. Recently, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to a 2X leveraged Bitcoin ETF, sparking an enthusiastic wave of speculation and anticipation for approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<h2>Delta hedging</h2>
<p>Amid the highly volatile crypto industry, Struct Finance&rsquo;s Interest Rate Products allow anyone to split and repackage the risk of any yield-bearing DeFi assets in different parts to fit their risk profile through an innovative process called &ldquo;tranching.&rdquo; Every Interest Rate Product is a single vault split into two portions, or tranches that have different return configurations:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Fixed-return Tranche for conservative investors looking for consistent returns</li>
<li>A Variable-return Tranche for investors with a higher risk appetite seeking superior returns</li>
</ol>
<p>The yield from the underlying asset flows into the fixed tranche first to ensure predictable returns. The remainder is then allocated to the variable tranche, which gets enhanced exposure to the underlying yield-bearing asset. Compared to the fixed tranche, the variable tranche might accrue more yield, less yield, or no yield.</p>
<p>As part of its BTC.B-USDC Vaults, Struct Finance has implemented a unique approach to managing investment risk: delta hedging. While the fixed tranche takes center stage with its high yield, the variable side of the product offers an additional layer of intriguing complexity and potential.</p>
<p>Upon deployment of funds into the vault, the BTC.B in the fixed tranche gets converted into GMX&rsquo;s GLP token, setting up a position that&rsquo;s short Bitcoin against GLP and contributing a negative delta. In contrast, the USDC on the variable side is converted into GLP, which inherently carries a positive delta.</p>
<p>This innovative delta-hedged product design achieves a fine balance between the positive and negative delta forces. It results in a robust strategy that allows investors to confidently navigate the crypto market&rsquo;s inherent volatility.</p>
<p>This artful interplay of the fixed and variable sides within the vaults opens the doors for investors to tap into the potential of Bitcoin investments like never before. By catering to a diverse range of risk appetites, Struct Finance ensures that both retail and institutional investors can tailor their strategies to maximize their returns, regardless of market conditions.</p>
<h3>About Struct Finance</h3>
<p>Struct Finance is at the forefront of the DeFi revolution, with a vision to transform the design and utility of financial products. It empowers users to design their own financial instruments, harnessing the power of tokenized, yield-bearing positions to unlock a world of diverse investment opportunities. Moreover, its cutting-edge financial products adopt a tranche-based system, smartly distributing yield between different investor classes. This balanced approach guarantees a steady yield for risk-averse investors while also offering the prospect of heightened returns to the more adventurous. Initially available on Avalanche, Struct Finance plans to go multichain in the near future.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Helium rose double digits as did 1inch and NEM after US inflation data&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin price on the other hand touched $31k on Coinbase and Ethereum hovered near $1.9k.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Consumer prices rose 0.2% month-over-month and 3% year-over-year in June.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> moved slightly higher on Wednesday after stock markets reacted positively to the latest US inflation data. However, the flagship cryptocurrency continued to hover near a crucial level as bulls looked to retest year-to-date highs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">BTC was changing hands near $30,800 at 11 am ET, having touched intraday highs of $31k on Coinbase</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elsewhere in the crypto market, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap Ethereum was trading towards $1,900 as the total market cap rose 1.5% to above $1.24 trillion. The rest of the top 10 coins were also green at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Litecoin, which had plunged 10% in the past week by early morning, had recouped some of the losses and was 5% down in that timeframe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The biggest gainers in the past 24 hours among the top 200 by market cap were 1inch, NEM and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/helium/">Helium</a>. All three had seen double digit upsides with HNT trading to highs of $1.48.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin, altcoins move higher on CPI data release</h2>
<p dir="ltr">US <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/stocks/">stocks</a> opened higher on Wednesday too as the US consumer price index (CPI) data for June showed inflation had cooled year-over-year during the past month. Prices rose 0.2% month-over-month and 3% YoY in June, the latter a deceleration from the 4% recorded in May.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to data released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, CPI was at its slowest in June, with the last time it was at this pace being March 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the CPI release, Charlie Bilello, Chief Market Strategist at Creative Planning Investor<a href="https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/1679113174484746247">&nbsp;<u>tweeted</u></a>:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>US CPI has moved down from a peak of 9.1% last June to 3.0% today. What&rsquo;s driving that decline? Lower rates of inflation in fuel oil, gasoline, gas utilities, used cars, medical care, apparel, new cars, food at home, electricity and transportation. Shelter is the only major component that has a higher inflation rate than a year ago and it is a wildly lagging indicator (actual housing inflation is much lower w/ home prices/rents down YoY)</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Federal Reserve paused its interest rate hike cycle last month, although it noted it was likely to go for a 0.25% hike on another two occasions before the end of 2023. How markets react to upcoming central bank moves will be key to both equities and crypto.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jim Bianco of Bianco Research LLC notes markets still expects a 25 bps rate hike on July 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/6</p>
<p>Despite the better-than-expected CPI report today, the probability of a July 26 rate of 25 basis points to 5.25% to 5.50% barely moved. </p>
<p>The market is strongly expecting a hike in two weeks. <a href="https://t.co/Kl2N5CEdPN">pic.twitter.com/Kl2N5CEdPN</a></p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Phase 2 of AltSignals presale is 50% sold out</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token&rsquo;s demand has been fueled by a proprietary trading service and AI craze</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">$ASI could rise to $0.1 in 2024 as more investors join ActualizeAI</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Days after a successful&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale</u></a> in phase 1, investors are back on AltSignals ($ASI) in the second stage. Phase 2 of the presale has raised more than $1.15 million, representing approximately 51.12% of the tokens. The quick presale underlines strong investor interest in the token of the trading signal service, despite the price rising slightly to $0.01875 in the second phase.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>AltSignals AI angle exciting for investors</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">AI has nearly been a buzzword in 2023, with analysts predicting it to be a game-changer for numerous industries. The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 started the craze as enthusiasm also gripped crypto and stock markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In trading, AI has been touted as a game-changer as it aids in machine learning, predicting modelling, and sentimental analysis to generate quality trading signals. AltSignals is tapping into the power of AI to supercharge trading results. The trading signal service has previously used a highly successful algorithm to generate signals for its over 52,000 traders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dubbed AltAlgo&trade;, the algorithm has produced over 3,782 trading signals, with accuracy rates averaging 64%. Owing to the increase in AI application, AltSignals want to take the game higher and make its platform a go-to place for new and seasoned traders in stock, forex, crypto, and CFD markets.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is AltSignals&rsquo;s AI trading service&rsquo;s value proposition?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals AI trading service will be dubbed ActualizeAI. The team looks at ActualizeAI as the ideal iteration to expand the scope of the trading instruments covered and increase the accuracy of the signals. Investors will become ActualizeAI members by buying $ASI, the token that will power the trading community and become the medium of exchanging value.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the benefits of owning $ASI is access to quality trading signals by the AltSignals team. With the early success of AltSignals since its founding in 2017, there has been a lot of enthusiasm that the AI service will grow investors&rsquo; earnings. Investors also benefit from the appreciation in the value of $ASI as the AI trading service continues to garner popularity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ActualizeAI members acquire trading-related skills by participating in tournaments and competitions on the platform. They also get to accumulate $ASI for winning competitions against other traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other utilities that $ASI carries include participation in community governance which gives holders the decision-making power in the affairs of the platform. There are also exclusive presale opportunities and access to AI-powered products for ActualizeAI members.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will $ASI reach $0.1 in 2023?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">$ASI is a token with a lot of potential, given that $AltSignals has been in existence and has organically built a trusted trading community. Coupled with the growing popularity of AI, the potential for the token to rise by up to $0.1 is strong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A prediction of $0.1 in 2023, however, looks too soon since it means the price must rise by 1,000%. As the token starts listing in the third quarter, investors should expect substantial price increases, with a prediction of three-digit percentage rises more likely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Predictably, a 1,000% is likely in 2024. This is when all the developmental activity of ActualizeAI will have occurred, opening the doors to more investors.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Should you buy $ASI this week?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">$ASI is in its second presale phase, and the price is rising at each stage. With less than 50% left to end phase 2 of the presale and the price to rise, it could be the right time to buy the token.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, $ASI is geared toward listing on Uniswap in the third quarter. Listing on an exchange means the token will be opened up to more investors, giving it a chance to skyrocket in price. This means that buying now presents a better opportunity for investors as the token&rsquo;s value is still low.</p>
