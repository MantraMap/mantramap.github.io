			  <description><![CDATA[<p>India&rsquo;s regulators have yet again made their opinions on crypto known. The latest to reiterate the country&rsquo;s position on crypto is the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, who has called for a complete ban. </p>
<p>The Governor of the RBI, Shaktikanta Das, while addressing the Business Today Banking and Economy Summit on Friday, again made the central bank&rsquo;s stance on cryptocurrencies clear, reiterating the significance of banning the industry. Das described the crypto trade as &ldquo;nothing but gambling&rdquo; adding that the definition of crypto remains &ldquo;very unclear.&rdquo; Das went as far as to say their perceived &ldquo;value is nothing but make-believe.&rdquo; The Governor used very dismissive language while describing cryptocurrencies and argued that there is no valid reason to acknowledge crypto as an &ldquo;asset&rdquo; or even a &ldquo;financial product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Das also asserted:</p>

<p>Since we don&rsquo;t allow gambling in our country, and if you want to allow gambling, treat it as gambling and lay down the rules for gambling. But crypto is not a financial product.</p>

<p>The Governor warned that legalizing cryptocurrencies would lead to more dollarization of the economy adding that crypto masquerading as a financial asset is a misplaced argument. Das also referred to the risk that could see the RBI lose control over the country&rsquo;s money supply. The substantiate this argument he mentioned the fact that &ldquo;20 percent of transactions are happening through crypto,&rdquo; none of which are authorized or regulated by the central bank. Governor Das further made reference to the age-old argument against cryptocurrencies &ndash; their price volatility, noting:</p>

<p>The volatility in prices is based on the make-believe concept where a particular crypto&rsquo;s price can go up or down. So, anything that comes without any underline whose valuations is entirely dependent on make-believe is just 100 percent speculation or it can be bluntly termed as gambling.</p>

<p>The Governor also recently made a bold statement saying that cryptocurrencies should be banned, and if allowed to grow, might cause the next financial crisis.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to moderate after its recent surge early in the Asian session as the pair traded below the 21000 figure after recently trading as high as the 21321.98 area before coming off to the 20333.33 level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Stops were elected above the 19856.70 and 20947.28 areas en route to the recent multi-week high, upside price objectives related to buying pressure that emerged around the 16326.16 and 17315.08 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above the 20190.78 area during the ascent, representing the 78.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460, and this level served as technical support during a pullback.&nbsp; BTC/USD bulls are eyeing the 21488.32, 21920, 23127.09, and 23196.08 levels as areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure, related to historical selling pressure that emerged around the 25214.57, 32371, and 48240 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stops were also recently elected above the 19260.93 area, an important upside price objective related to buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 16273.40 levels.&nbsp; Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 19938, 19082, 18390, 17699, and 16714 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 18105.19 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 19987.19.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18390.99/ 16714.46/ 14500.15 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;21488.32/ 22912.49/ 23127.09 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that 2022 has been an action-packed year for the blockchain market, one that witnessed a wide range of developments associated with public as well as permissioned systems. To this point, the year gone by saw enterprise blockchains being adopted on a wider scale, with many reputable companies harnessing their benefits over tried and tested, conventional solutions. Not only that, the recent slew of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) collapses ushered in notable improvements within the blockchain analytics sector as well as the tracking of everyday transactions.&nbsp;</p>
A quick recap of 2022
<p>As per reports, the total volume of investment having entered the enterprise blockchain ecosystem continued to grow in 2022, with the metric likely to hit the $16 billion mark by the end of this year. To this point, it should be noted that a whopping 77% of the world&rsquo;s top 100 firms &mdash; including Microsoft, Visa, Nestle &mdash; have started incorporating blockchain solutions into their day-to-day operations, with some even utilizing multiple enterprise blockchains for facilitating separate processes.</p>
<p>Similarly, when it comes to public blockchains, their utility and general scope of operations grew exponentially. For example, the idea of sustainable blockchains garnered an increasing amount of mainstream traction last year, especially with green investing and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives growing in importance among today&rsquo;s investors over the last few years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the tokenization of real estate assets and the idea of Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) &mdash; an independent audit facilitated by a third party to ensure that a custodian holds the assets it claims to &mdash; also gained a lot of popularity last year.</p>
What does 2023 promise?
<p>From the outside looking in, the future will likely encompass a variety of blockchains interfacing with one another, birthing new use cases that lie outside the realm of their current capabilities individually. To elaborate, the creation of a hybrid multi-chain ecosystem can allow centralized and decentralized applications to expand into untapped niches of the global financial system, thereby relegating the idea of &lsquo;one type of blockchain dominating the market&rsquo; to the background completely.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the recent dissolution of prominent crypto entities &mdash; such as Celcius, Vauld, Voyager Digital, etc &mdash; has greatly reduced investor confidence in the blockchain industry, the coming year will likely see companies beginning to incorporate better transparency tools within their existing governance frameworks. In this regard, ParallelChain Lab, a blockchain technology company, recently organized the International Symposium of Blockchain Advancements 2022 (ISBA) &mdash; a two-day event bringing together industry experts and investors from around the world &mdash; to discuss the future of Web3 and blockchain tech.</p>
<p>With the issue of transparency fast gaining traction within the crypto world, projects like ParallelChain are amalgamating the benefits put forth by blockchain tech and data sciences to help forge a truly decentralized future. The project provides users with complete control over their private information while creating a feedback loop in which the blockchain creates and handles data while the data science models perform the required analysis to accrue meaningful insights while empowering users to make well-informed business decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as Web3-enabled tools continue to seep into today&rsquo;s daily societal interactions, it appears as though the future of blockchain will continue to play a crucial role in driving new tech innovations while paving ground-breaking use cases within a plethora of industries. Alice Lim, a distinguished engineer associated with the development of ParallelChain Mainnet, believes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[In the not so distant future] more dApp developers will realize the performance and cost benefits of building on an L2 (or generally outside a busy mainnet) and start coming up with creative new blockchain applications that were not economically viable before.&rdquo;</p>
The future of blockchain tech looks bright.
<p>As people across the globe gravitate toward the use of blockchain-enabled systems, it stands to reason that the technology will become increasingly more robust, thus maximizing its adoption potential. Also, as these platforms evolve, they can help the blockchain sector become more immune to various extenuating factors, such as fluctuations experienced by the crypto market on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, with blockchain tech starting to strengthen its foothold over the digital infrastructure powering the global digital economy, experts believe that its use cases will grow, expanding far beyond the realm of simple finance and payments. Thus, it will be interesting to see how this space continues to evolve from here on out.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A Texas university is the latest to offer a Bitcoin course for students. The course will teach Bitcoin programming.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrency courses are becoming increasingly popular in colleges and universities across the United States. The latest institution to join the trend is Texas A&amp;M University, which has announced that it will be offering a course on the "Bitcoin Protocol" to its students starting from January 17th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course will be taught by Associate Professor Korok Ray of Mays Business School at Texas A&amp;M and will be followed by a course on "Programming Bitcoin" where students will learn to "build a Bitcoin library from scratch."</p>
<p>Professor Korok was obviously delighted with the new course and tweeted out: &ldquo;I will be teaching the first ever Bitcoin class at Texas A&amp;M this spring&rdquo;. He went on to say that it had taken months to get the course approved. In another tweet he stated that the course would be based on Jimmy Song&rsquo;s &ldquo;Programming Bitcoin&rdquo;.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We will follow Programming Bitcoin by @jimmysong, and build a Bitcoin library from scratch.</p>
&mdash; Korok Ray (@KorokRay) January 12, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrency courses in universities is seen as a positive step towards improving financial literacy and understanding the potential of this revolutionary technology. In an article first published on the story by CoinTelegraph, crypto researcher Josh Cowell was quoted as saying that a lack of high-quality crypto education has been a key roadblock in taking adoption to the next level.</p>
<p>It's not just technical aspects of bitcoin and cryptocurrency that are being taught in US colleges, legal and regulatory implications of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are also becoming a part of the curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other universities that now offer cryptocurrency courses include Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oxford University, National University of Singapore, Cornell University and University of California Berkeley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the popularity of bitcoin and cryptocurrency continues to grow, it is likely that more and more educational institutions will recognize the importance of providing students with a solid understanding of the underlying principles and potential applications of this technology.</p>

<p>Professor Korok was obviously delighted with the new course and tweeted out: &ldquo;I will be teaching the first ever Bitcoin class at Texas A&amp;M this spring&rdquo;. He went on to say that it had taken months to get the course approved. In another tweet he stated that the course would be based on Jimmy Song&rsquo;s &ldquo;Programming Bitcoin&rdquo;.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We will follow Programming Bitcoin by @jimmysong, and build a Bitcoin library from scratch.</p>

</p>
<p>The adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrency courses in universities is seen as a positive step towards improving financial literacy and understanding the potential of this revolutionary technology. In an article first published on the story by CoinTelegraph, crypto researcher Josh Cowell was quoted as saying that a lack of high-quality crypto education has been a key roadblock in taking adoption to the next level.</p>
<p>It's not just technical aspects of bitcoin and cryptocurrency that are being taught in US colleges, legal and regulatory implications of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are also becoming a part of the curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other universities that now offer cryptocurrency courses include Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oxford University, National University of Singapore, Cornell University and University of California Berkeley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the popularity of bitcoin and cryptocurrency continues to grow, it is likely that more and more educational institutions will recognize the importance of providing students with a solid understanding of the underlying principles and potential applications of this technology.</p>

<p>The BIS, a global banking coordination body, has released a paper entitled Addressing the risks in crypto: laying out the options, in which it suggests three approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. The BIS maintains that after the chaos that ensued following the collapse of FTX, regulators can no longer afford to ignore crypto.</p>

</p>
Leaving the Crypto Sector Unregulated is no Longer Viable
<p>In its piece, the BIS indicated that the collapse of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s entire crypto empire demonstrated that the idea of decentralization in cryptocurrencies is often unrealistic and delusional as governance is concentrated in the majority of decentralized finance projects and for this reason, the industry is not at a point where it is ready to be completely self-governed. The crypto industry is exposed to many of the same vulnerabilities as traditional finance (TradFi), but risks are further amplified by the nuances of crypto. The authors of the BIS reason that we can therefore leave the crypto sector without proper regulation as the danger it poses to retail investors are far too great. The BIS opined:</p>

<p>Several business models in crypto turned out to be outright Ponzi schemes. These characteristics, coupled with the huge information deficit customers face, strongly undermine investor protection and market integrity.</p>

Ban, Contain, or Regulate Cryptocurrencies
<p>For the reasons stated above, the BIS has offered three approaches to deal with cryptocurrencies:</p>

<p>Depending on the targeted features of the crypto world and the relative efficacy of each measure, either as stand-alone measures or in combination, authorities could combine specific bans, containment and regulation. By way of illustration, individual jurisdictions could ban energy-intensive proof-of-work tokens or the distribution of algorithmic stablecoins. Some intermediaries that bridge TradFi and crypto could also be regulated. Other parts of crypto could be isolated as part of a containment strategy.</p>

<p>The BIS&rsquo;s first approach includes a total ban on cryptocurrencies to eliminate all the associated risks. This approach would protect investors against vulnerabilities such as scams. They further argue that this approach would increase the stability of financial systems. Imposing a total ban on cryptocurrencies is however not viable as bans can be circumvented.</p>
<p>The BIS&rsquo;s second approach is to isolate or contain cryptocurrencies from TradFi. By this, the BIS means ringfencing cryptocurrencies so that there is minimal overlap with TradFi. Experts however admit that such an approach is no longer possible as the industry has evolved to a point where it is intertwined with TradFi. This approach will also not offer investors improved protection.</p>
<p>The BIS offers to regulate cryptocurrencies as its third approach and from deduction, it seems to be the most realistic approach to take. Regulating crypto would mean governments can regulate the industry in much of the same way as traditional financial institutions. It argues that &ldquo;responsible players,&rdquo; meaning those entities that are committed to a safe and sustainable crypto industry, would benefit from proper regulation. Regulation would however be challenging in that it is difficult to identify a &ldquo;reference point&rdquo; in a decentralized space. A reference point refers to legal entities or responsible persons. The BIS however says that it sees the starting point of such an endeavor as the entity that has control over the protocol.</p>
<p>In its conclusion, the BIS has encouraged central banks to instill sound innovation and create payment solutions that will offer those who rely on the benefits of cryptocurrencies, such as cost-efficiency, speed, and financial inclusion, without the risks of cryptos. Alternatively, it has also been suggested that more central banks develop central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and in this way, the global demand for cryptocurrencies could be significantly reduced.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies have run amuck over the last few days as Bitcoin has helped lead the sector out of the doldrums.&nbsp;</p>
An unexpected surge
<p>A huge pump to the upside has seen the total market cap of crypto push through the $1 trillion mark, a level not seen since early November of last year.</p>
<p>At only $830 million on the first day of January, things had not been looking particularly rosy for the crypto asset class, but bitcoin was about to have other ideas and a slow incremental crawl upwards suddenly saw the king of the cryptos catch fire and surge upwards.</p>
<p>Even though BTC dominance continued to climb over the last few days, various cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin&rsquo;s example in a big way. Probably one of the biggest turn-arounds among the large cap cryptos has been Solana.</p>
Solana
<p>When the FTX collapse happened things turned very bad for the Solana price, given that Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research had been big supporters and holders of Solana and the $SOL token.</p>
<p>At one point $SOL was under $8, and for some commentators, was heading for zero. However, such a supremely fast blockchain with such a large ecosystem was not going to keep on going down.</p>
<p>In fact, the price has trebled since that time and has currently settled at around $23. A pullback is possibly on the cards next, and $14 might well be a good place to start accumulating again.</p>
Avalanche
<p>Avalanche is another of the large caps to make some great gains over the last couple of weeks. Although not in the same league as $SOL, $AVAX managed to increase by 75% over this period. Most of this increase would have no doubt been due to the AWS partnership.</p>
Ethereum
<p>Obviously, when large cap alts are mentioned Ethereum will always spring to mind. A more than 35% increase over the last 2 weeks is not to be sneered at, and if Ethereum&rsquo;s market cap is taken into account, the increase in value here is probably more than for any of the other large cap alts.</p>
<p>In fact, it could be said that Ethereum is the main cryptocurrency leading the rest of the pack higher. The ETH/BTC pair has been on an upwards trajectory since June of last year. For many, the ETH flippening of BTC is only a matter of time.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Rockets Above 21000:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 15 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) reached its highest level since early November early in the Asian session as the pair traded as high as the 21321.98 area before coming off to the 20333.33 level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Stops were elected above the 19856.70 and 20947.28 areas en route to the multi-week high, upside price objectives related to buying pressure that emerged around the 16326.16 and 17315.08 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above the 20190.78 area during the ascent, representing the 78.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460, and this level served as technical support during a pullback.&nbsp; BTC/USD bulls are eyeing the 21488.32, 21920, 23127.09, and 23196.08 levels as areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure, related to historical selling pressure that emerged around the 25214.57, 32371, and 48240 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stops were also recently elected above the 19260.93 area, an important upside price objective related to buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 16273.40 levels.&nbsp; Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 19938, 19082, 18390, 17699, and 16714 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17871.93 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 19568.63.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Around 800 victims of the BitConnect scheme will soon receive a portion of $17 million in restitution after a court ruling ordered it so. </p>
<p>A court ruling on Thursday by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ordered that the roughly 800 victims of the infamous BitConnect scheme are to receive a portion of $17 million in restitution. The court ruling described BitConnect as a crypto lending platform that touted proprietary technology including the &ldquo;Bitconnect Trading Bot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Volatility Software&rdquo; that claimed it would guarantee investors' returns.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice issued a press release that stated:</p>

<p>In truth, however, BitConnect operated a textbook Ponzi scheme by paying earlier BitConnect investors with money from later investors.</p>

<p>The U.S.-based promoter for BitConnect, Glenn Arcaro, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2021 and has been sentenced to 38 months in jail. The DOJ also announced that it would sell $56 million worth of crypto seized from Arcaro to compensate victims of the scheme.</p>
The BitConnect Crypto Scheme
<p>BitConnect launched in February 2016 and employed a multi-tier pyramid structure to reward its investors based on the number of affiliates they introduced into the program. The project reportedly promised a one percent average daily return, claiming that investors could turn a $1,000 investment into $36,000 in one year. Many industry heavyweights such as Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, repeatedly warned consumers against the dangers of BitConnect.</p>
<p>In October 2017, BitConnect&rsquo;s native token, BCC, was ranked as the eighth most valuable token with a market cap of almost $2.6 billion. The project eventually collapsed in 2018 after regulators intervened and forced it to shut down. Following the fall of BitConnect, investors eventually got their BCC tokens back, but by that point, the token dropped from its all-time high of around $500 to less than $1.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>What a week for Bitcoin. Seven daily green bars saw the price of bitcoin break through major resistances and hit a high of over $21,200.</p>
Gloomy price action
<p>Sideways and gradually down since June of last year, Bitcoin has been pretty boring, and for many there may have been a ball of foreboding in the pits of their stomachs as they saw the price just keep on meandering downwards.</p>
<p>As big player after big player in the crypto sector went into bankruptcy, and bad news upon bad news beset the industry, it seemed a bear market like no other, and with the economy approaching (or in) recession there weren&rsquo;t too many chinks of light to be seen.</p>
A glorious surge
<p>However, bitcoin crossed a major trendline last Sunday that it has respected ever since the top of the last bull market back in November of 2021. Around three smallish green candles followed before bigger ones that culminated in a glorious week-long surge.</p>
<p>First the $19,500 resistance was taken out on Friday with hardly a pause, then bitcoin crashed through $20,000, and eventually got as high as $21,270 first thing this morning.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful surge, but there&rsquo;s always more to do. Had bitcoin managed to get above $21,500 it would have made an extremely important higher high. As it is, it failed to do so, and so perhaps the next step is to see if the price can hold above either $20,500, or more significantly above $19,500 by close of play on Sunday.</p>
USDT dominance plunges
<p>As bitcoin was doing its thing, it was gratifying to see how the USDT dominance was heading in the opposite direction. A trendline that also started late in 2021 was being followed closely by USDT dominance. It broke to the downside early last week and fell hard and fast, though without making a lower low.</p>
What&rsquo;s next?
<p>So what&rsquo;s in store for bitcoin and crypto now? Bitcoin has taken a bit of a breather at time of going to press, and the price sits at around $20,700. Some big players have started to take profits, but the picture should be clearer once this week is completed.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Beleaguered crypto lender Hodlnaut is facing possible liquidation after the firm&rsquo;s creditors reject the company&rsquo;s proposed restructuring plan. Creditors are instead seeking liquidation of the lender&rsquo;s assets. </p>
<p>Reports by Bloomberg indicate that Hodlnaut&rsquo;s creditors would rather have the firm liquidated and said that it better serves their interests according to a filing prepared by Hodlnaut&rsquo;s interim judicial managers. Under the proposed restructuring plans, Holdnaut&rsquo;s directors, who were at the helm during its collapse, would continue managing the company.

<p>Hodlnaut first showed signs of trouble in August 2022 when the firm suspended customer withdrawals citing &ldquo;volatile market conditions&rdquo; and a liquidity issue. However, it later came to the surface that the company downplayed its exposure to the collapsed Terra ecosystem, and consequently it was revealed that the lender lost almost $190 million. The company executive reportedly later got rid of thousands of documents related to company investments ins an effort to hide Hodlnaut&rsquo;s exposure.</p>
<p>After suspending customer withdrawals, token swaps, and deposits, the firm applied for judicial management to offer it temporary protection against legal proceedings, claiming it allows it &ldquo;breathing space&rdquo; to focus on its recovery plan. Judicial management refers to a form of debt restructuring that sees an entity managing a business, property, and assets of a distressed company.</p>
<p>In November however, it was announced that the company is reportedly facing an investigation by the Singapore police related to alleged fraud and cheating. Reports suggest that the lender had downplayed its exposure to a &ldquo;specific token.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Eyes More Gains Above 19000:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 14 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retained a strong bid early in the Asian session as the pair orbited the 19000 figure after trading as high as the 19295 level, its strongest print since early November 2022. &nbsp;Stops were elected above the 18636.72 area during the climb, a level that represents an upside price objective related to buying pressure that emerged around the 16326.16 and 17315.08 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;The move to the 19115 area was a test of the 19182 area that also represents another upside price objective related to buying pressure that strengthened around the 16326.16 and 17315.08 levels.&nbsp; Additionally, the move also represented a test of the 61.8% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460, and related upside retracement levels include the 20058 and 20190 areas.&nbsp; BTC/USD bulls are eyeing the 20947.28 area as an additional upside price objective associated with these areas where strong bids lifted the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stops were also elected above the 19260.93 area, an important upside price objective related to buying pressure around that emerged around the 15460 and 16273.40 levels.&nbsp; Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and potential buying pressure are around the 18253, 17719, 17287, 16856, 16322, and 16242 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17412.61 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 18369.67.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;19199.48/ 20070.64/ 20837.83 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com announced that it would be cutting jobs by 20% as a result of the &ldquo;significant damage&rdquo; the industry has suffered due to the fall of FTX. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Crypto.com has said that it would be cutting its workforce by around 20% amid the ongoing crypto winter and the ramifications of FTX. The company cited economic difficulties as the overall market downturn continues and the catastrophic collapse of FTX as the reason for its decision. In a company post, CEO and co-founder, Kris Marszalek, said:</p>
<p>We grew ambitiously at the start of 2022, building on our incredible momentum and aligning with the trajectory of the broader industry. That trajectory changed rapidly with a confluence of negative economic developments.</p>
<p>From the company&rsquo;s social media profiles, it has been determined that Crypto.com has somewhere between 3,500-4,500 employees, meaning that around 700-900 employees stand to lose their jobs. The exchange had to make significant staff reductions in mid-2022 after the crypto market took a serious knock following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Marszalek addressed this in the company&rsquo;s post by saying:</p>

<p>The reductions we made last July positioned us to weather the macroeconomic downturn, but it did not account for the recent collapse of FTX, which significantly damaged trust in the industry. It&rsquo;s for this reason, as we continue to focus on prudent financial management, we made the difficult but necessary decision to make additional reductions in order to position the company for long-term success.</p>

Major Crypto Firms Make Staff Reductions
<p>Crypto.com is the latest major firm to cut jobs recently. Earlier this week Coinbase, one of the biggest and most popular crypto exchanges, announced plans to reduce its headcount significantly. A company statement said that the layoffs are a result of the &ldquo;evolving industry landscape&rdquo; and a need to &ldquo;align our company with the current market conditions.&rdquo; In a bid to cut costs, Coinbase will lay off around 950 employees. Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency brokerage, announced on Thursday that it would be letting go of 28%, or 110 members, of its staff. The firm similarly cited macroenvironmental conditions for its decision.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, in an astonishing and highly unusual blog post, stated that he did not steal any funds or stash away billions as claimed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He blamed Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for orchestrating the liquidity crisis that led to the eventual fall of FTX and its associated businesses.&nbsp;</p>
An Unusual Blog Post&nbsp;
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, has claimed that he did not steal any money or have billions stashed away. He made the claims in a blog post published a month after his arrest by authorities on charges of fraud. Federal prosecutors have stated that Bankman-Fried and his associates stole billions of dollars from FTX users to pay the debts of Alameda Research, a crypto-based hedge fund and FTX&rsquo;s sister concern. Prosecutors also allege that customer funds were used to purchase real estate and donate to various US political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal funds, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t stash billions away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. However, The former CEO&rsquo;s closest associates have pleaded guilty to defrauding users and have agreed to cooperate with authorities. Former Alameda Research executive, Caroline Ellison, stated in her plea that Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives received billions of dollars in secret loans from Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
A Lot More To Say&nbsp;
<p>Typically, defense lawyers always advise their clients to refrain from making any public statements before any trial, let alone one as significant as this. In the substack post, Bankman-Fried did not directly address the charges brought against him by prosecutors but stated that he had a lot more to say. Charges against Bankman-Fried are primarily that he misled investors, users, and lenders about the finances of FTX and Alameda research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s spokesperson, and the US Attorney&rsquo;s office in Manhattan, have so far declined to comment on the matter.&nbsp;</p>
Significant Sum Recovered&nbsp;
<p>In the Substack post, Bankman-Fried stated that FTX&rsquo;s US wing is fully solvent, and the parent company also has billions of dollars in assets. He further added that there was a good chance customers could be compensated. Bankman-Fried wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it were to reboot, I believe there is a real chance that customers could be made substantially whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s comments came after a lawyer for the FTX exchange told the federal bankruptcy court in Delaware that the exchange had located around $5 billion in liquid assets. The lawyer further added that it planned to sell several non-strategic investments it had made. These investments had a book value of around $4.6 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure did not include the assets seized by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Bahamas, where FTX was headquartered. While authorities in the Bahamas claim they had seized around $3.5 billion, FTX has claimed the value of the seized funds to be around $170 million.</p>
Alameda Research, FTX Fell To Extreme Market Crash&nbsp;
<p>According to Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research fell to an extreme market crash in the cryptocurrency ecosystem after failing to hedge against it adequately. He wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Alameda became illiquid, FTX International did as well because Alameda had a margin position open on FTX.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He alleged that Alameda Research and its assets were the subject of a targeted attack by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing him of orchestrating the liquidity crisis that led to the eventual downfall of FTX. In November, Zhao tweeted that Binance was planning to dump its holdings of FTX&rsquo;s native FTT token. The CEO pointed to a report which stated that Alameda Research&rsquo;s assets were primarily comprised of FTT tokens, sparking a run of massive withdrawals from FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This direct attack on Zhao was markedly different from previous occasions when Bankman-Friend had only hinted at Zhao&rsquo;s role in the FTX collapse.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market is set to come under increased scrutiny from the U.S. House of Representatives, with the formation of a new subcommittee.&nbsp;</p>
A new subcommittee
<p>According to a report by Politico, North Carolina Representative Patrick McHenry, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, plans to create the subcommittee to fill a "big hole" in the committee's current structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new panel, led by French Hill of Arkansas and Warren Davidson of Ohio, will discuss issues related to digital assets, financial technology, and financial inclusion.</p>
<p>McHenry, who has placed crypto regulation at the top of his legislative agenda, stated that the group will be responsible for crafting policies that support financial technology to reach underserved communities and providing clear norms among federal regulators. The subcommittee will hold hearings and play a key role in bill development.</p>
Crypto dominates the financial agenda
<p>The establishment of the digital asset group shows how cryptocurrency has come to dominate the financial regulatory agenda in Congress. In the past, the Financial Services Committee was primarily concerned with the oversight of banks, Wall Street corporations, and their regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the digital asset industry has grown as a lobbying force, with companies attempting to improve the regulatory environment and gain important allies from both parties.</p>
New FTX hearing in 2023
<p>After a steep drop in recent months and the collapse of the once-dominant FTX, which spurred fraud charges against the exchange's top executives, crypto businesses are now playing defence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee is set to hold another hearing under McHenry to investigate the collapse of bitcoin exchange FTX, with McHenry stating that lawmakers will further discuss the bankrupt crypto business in 2023.</p>

The energy efficient glass is a see-through windows solution that blocks the majority of solar heat from entering the building and significantly reduces the energy consumption in terms of HVAC load.</p>
<p>YES WORLD is inceptualized and promoted by Save Earth activist Dr Sandeep Choudhary, who has constantly been working to generate awareness of global warming and climate change impacts. Under Dr. Choudhary's vision and leadership, YES WORLD has championed a noble cause of reducing carbon footprint and bringing forth the issue of global warming and climate change.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY,, DUBAI, 13th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Global exchange LBank has revealed more details about its new system for trading crypto derivatives. The exchange&rsquo;s tech team has shared fresh information about the update which was implemented on December 27 and has disclosed further upcoming improvements.</p>
<p>LBank&rsquo;s new industry-leading derivatives system promises a stable, user-centric experience 24/7. The updated system for handling LBank&rsquo;s derivatives products features more flexible trading options including functions for managing stop-losses and managing profits, more comprehensive data charts, and security enhancements. A dedicated service team is on hand to help users with trading problems in a timely manner and gather user feedback for the tech team.</p>
<p>The new derivatives trading system is a milestone release for LBank&rsquo;s tech team, which shared: &ldquo;After six months of hard work and tons of feedback sessions with users, we are very excited about the final product. We believe the update matches the growing need for a user-centric crypto derivatives platform and LBank&rsquo;s philosophy to drive innovation in the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derivatives on LBank are primarily made up of perpetual contracts, which are crypto future contracts without an expiry date. Traders can also employ the Tether (USDT) stablecoin to flexibly adjust leverage and margins after opening long or short positions.</p>
<p>The engine behind the new derivatives system can process massive amounts of orders per second with a minimal latency of only 5 milliseconds. A wide range of popular operating systems is compatible so that users can trade anywhere and from any device.</p>
<p>Derivative products for portfolio investments are next on LBank&rsquo;s roadmap. In addition, there are optimizations to trading pairs and settlement contracts, as well as brand-new derivative products that will allow unified accounts of multiple users to make portfolio investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Top crypto exchanges are constantly striving towards a more optimal user experience for trading cryptocurrencies and other assets. Improving the quality of derivatives programmes, which dominate total crypto market volume, are critical to realizing this goal.</p>
