			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall&rsquo;s crypto anti-money laundering bill has been postponed due to a lack of sponsorships. </p>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Roger Marshall have been forced to delay their notorious cryptocurrency anti-money laundering bill while the duo recruit more co-sponsors, Blockworks reports. No date has been provided for when the bill&rsquo;s next iteration can be expected.</p>
<p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act was first introduced in the Senate in December and sought to require the crypto industry, including miners and validators, to comply with rigorous know-your-customer (KYC) rules. The Senator&rsquo;s revised version has not been made public but reportedly includes the same language its opponents have a problem with.</p>
<p>Blockworks obtained a document which outlines which groups will be responsible for complying with KYC rules:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhosted wallet providers, digital asset miners, validators, or other nodes that may act to validate or secure third-party transactions, independent network participants, including maximal extractable value searchers, miner extractable value searchers, and other validators or network participants with control over network protocols.&rdquo;</p>

Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Bill Has Consumers on the Fence
<p>The postponement certainly affords lawmakers more time to assess the potential impact of this legislation, which makes crypto enthusiasts uneasy about the future of digital assets.</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s strict regulation has been criticised by many as a hindrance to the development of the industry. At the same time, its supporters argue that clear guidelines are necessary to protect consumers and prevent illicit activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Opinion
<p>Regulatory guidance will undoubtedly positively impact the market and inspire renewed confidence among investors. However, we must ask whether Senator Warren and Marshall are overreaching in their scope or whether this is what the industry needs.</p>
<p>Whatever the answer may be, one thing is for sure: a concerted effort needs to be made to explore alternative approaches which offer more security to the market while at the same time maintaining the uniqueness of digital assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">A savvy Crypto investor knows when to buy, sell or hold their coins. More importantly, know vitality&mdash;when to buy and what to avoid. Some old guards like Monero (XMR) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have made investors have a run for their money&mdash;making them keep burning their fingers. </p>
<p class="s6">It has made investors want to diversify their portfolio with presale gems with potential growth of up to 4,000%. With newcomer Sparklo predicted to have a bright future in a highly volatile market, investors are waiting in anticipation of its launch.</p>
<p class="s6">What is it that makes a presale gem like Sparklo have so much promise?</p>
<p class="s3">Dogecoin (DOGE) Experiences the Highest Volatility</p>
<p class="s6">Even with great social media influences, Dogecoin (DOGE) has consistently plummeted, with a new all-time high of 14%&mdash;this was after Platformer reported that Twitter stopped the development of a crypto wallet. Looking at where it is now, from its all-time high price, it&rsquo;s no doubt that DOGE has crashed on the market by about 92%.</p>
<p class="s6">Dogecoin (DOGE) was at its peak when its breakout coincided with Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter deal. The acquisition deal was a positive development for the coin. Elon has suggested integrating Dogecoin (DOGE) to become a meme coin.</p>
<p class="s6">It sounds great, but it's still in theoretical development. Some experts believe that having a future Crypto Twitter is not a bad idea. After Elon acquired Twitter, Dogecoin (DOGE) prices went up for a while. But, due to a Platformer report, Dogecoin (DOGE) is among the worst performers on the Crypto Charts.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s6">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Price Predictions Don't Show Confidence for Monero (XMR)</p>
<p class="s6">Monero (XMR) provides privacy-centric proof of work functionality to ensure that transactions for users are private and non-traceable. Initially, it attracted investors who wanted 100% privacy when transacting. Far from that, it had many exciting use cases.</p>
<p class="s6">Lately, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case, as price prediction shows XMR on a downward spiral, just after the launch of Monero (XMR), which saw its peak at $542.33 hovered to less than 10% of its peak. When you look at its bullish runs in 2021, you'll notice that Monero (XMR) failed to hit its all-time peak and was trading below $480.</p>
<p class="s6">There's no confidence as far as bull runs are concerned in the future. It's unlikely Monero (XMR) will recover any time soon. Therefore, traders are advised to look for alternative coins with a brighter future.</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) Expected to Shoot to the Moons</p>
<p class="s6">As an alternative investment plan, Sparklo will give traders the best opportunity to trade and invest in fractionalized NFTs backed by Gold, Silver and Platinum&mdash;meaning that investors will have a fair chance of investing in NFTs representing real luxury assets.</p>
<p class="s6">More and more investors are waiting in anticipation for its launch since it offers opportunities to invest in precious metals&mdash;less risky assets. It's predicted that Sparklo will have a 4000% increase in price after launch&mdash;a reason to start buying now to make maximum profits.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, with its growth potential, SPRK will end up becoming the blue-chip Crypto. It gives you the best chance to get a future blue-chip Cryptocurrency at extremely affordable prices. It'll partner with jewellery stores to help bring new products to the market, plus offer great discounts to investors.</p>
<p class="s6">Worried about safety? Sparklo has measures in place to ensure safety. For starters, it has passed the InterFi network audit and will lock in liquidity for 100 years. In addition to this,Know Your Customer Audit will take place soon enough.</p>
<p class="s6">With unstable coins like Monero (XMR) not showing signs of making bullish runs, investors should seek out presale gems that have growth potential. With a price of $0.015 that's steadily rising to $0.017 by the end of the week, Sparklo is a fire innovative investment alternative that investors should watch.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US SEC fined and issued a cease-and-desist order against crypto exchange Coinme and its subsidiary, Up Global Inc., for conducting an unregistered and misleading ICO of a crypto asset called UpToken. </p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it issued a cease-and-desist order against Bitcoin ATM operator Coinme and its business subsidiary Up Global Inc. for conducting an unlawful ICO (initial coin offering) of the crypto asset UpToken. Coinme, Up Global and the companies&rsquo; founder and CEO, Neil Bergquist, have been ordered to pay fines amounting to $3.9 million.</p>
<p>Coinme and Up Global undertook an ICO in 2017 for the Ethereum-based asset UpToken to generate funds to expand Coinme ATM operations across the US.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s settlement report indicated the ICO generated over $3.65 million. Part of the funds was supposed to fund 30 new Coinme ATMs, and the remainder would be used for other corporate purposes. However, the SEC said investors were duped into believing Up Global would limit UpToken&rsquo;s supply while Coinme would generate constant demand for the token to finance a bitcoin ATM rewards program which would, in turn, boost UpToken&rsquo;s price.</p>
<p>The regulator says, however, that UpToken was promoted and sold to investors as an investment contract and is thus considered a security according to US financial laws. All parties involved in the offering have accordingly been accused of selling an unregistered security.</p>
<p>The SEC finally revealed that Coinme and its affiliates misled the public, claiming the ICO raised $18.5 million, in contrast to $3.65 million.</p>
Coinme, Up Global, and Bergquist Settle with the SEC
<p>The SEC levelled accusations against all three parties involved in the UpToken ICO, and all parties settled.</p>
<p>Following the settlement, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order against Coinme and Up Global, prohibiting them from indefinitely participating in any coin offering. In his personal capacity, Bergquist has been banned from participating in ICOs for three years.</p>
<p>Coinme and Up Global have been ordered to pay civil money penalties of $250,000 and $3,520,000, respectively, while Bergquist will pay a fine of $150,000.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) are increasingly seeing a drop in investor interest. This is reasonably expected because the average crypto investor is not just in the market for the tech; they want to see gains as well. </p>
<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) have recently failed to deliver on this front. Despite their seemingly strong fundamentals, Cosmos (ATOM) and Chainlink (LINK) have underperformed in the market, even during rallies. &nbsp;This has seen investors look elsewhere to take advantage of the market's profit opportunities. </p>
<p class="s3">One cryptocurrency currently in the investor spotlight is Sparklo (SPRK). There is so much optimism around Sparklo (SPRK) that some analysts expect it to reach the top 100 once the presale is over. </p>
<p class="s7">Chainlink (LINK) Whale Selling Stagnates The Price</p>
<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) saw one of the best price runs in 2020 and early 2021. From under $5, Chainlink (LINK) made highs of $50 on some exchanges. However, after April 2021, Chainlink(LINK) stagnated, and the price never saw new highs, even in the crypto peak out of November 2021. </p>
<p class="s3">Analysts believe that despite Chainlink (LINK)&rsquo;s strong fundamentals, it continues to face pressure from those who got in at ICO selling. This continued selling will likely keep the price depressed, especially now that crypto is still in a bear market. </p>
<p class="s3">This explains why savvy investors are looking beyond what Chainlink (LINK) can do as a technology and more toward where the profits will come from next. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK)&rsquo;s presale has seen a lot of inflow from Chainlink (LINK) investors, and analysts expect this to push Sparklo (SPRK) to unprecedented highs. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s7">Cosmos (ATOM) Inflationary Tokenomics Drives Away Investors</p>
<p class="s3">Cosmos (ATOM) has some of the best fundamentals in interconnecting Dapps from blockchains. </p>
<p class="s3">However, analysts don&rsquo;t expect Cosmos (ATOM) to give much in exponential returns on investment going into the future. Many believe Cosmos (ATOM)&rsquo;s biggest undoing is its inflationary tokenomics. </p>
<p class="s3">As long as new tokens keep flooding the market, Atom (ATOM) will likely underperform the rest of the market long term. </p>
<p class="s3">Investors are beginning to understand this, and the trend has been shifting towards new upcoming cryptocurrencies with better profit potential. </p>
<p class="s3">Cosmos (ATOM) investors are particularly intrigued by Sparklo (SPRK). It is a good chance at exponential gains since it is still in the presale stage, meaning a lot of upsides once exchange listings start. </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo PreSale Drawing Investors With a 30% Bonus Offer</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) presale has been drawing in many investors tired of holding underperforming cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p class="s3">One of the biggest draws to Sparklo (SPRK) is that the presale price is quite competitive. At only $0.015 and a bonus of 30% for the tokens bought, investors can&rsquo;t get enough of Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s3">Investors are also rushing to buy Sparklo (SPRK) ahead of the price increase scheduled for 30th April 2023. After that, the price will rise to $0.017.</p>
<p class="s3">However, the use case interests Sparklo (SPRK) investors the most. Sparklo (SPRK) has a strong use case, unlike most new cryptos founded on hype. It wants to make it possible for investors to buy small units of precious metals like Gold, Silver, and Platinum in NFTs. </p>
<p class="s3">The transparency of this project also inspires Sparklo (SPRK) investors. InterFi Network audits Sparklo (SPRK)&rsquo;s; no issues were found. There is also a KYC audit which is also above board. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One of Europe&rsquo;s leading decentralized crypto exchanges, StormGain DEX, is looking to replace complicated wallet addresses with human-readable names in order to improve access to its trading platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do so, it&rsquo;s partnering with a company called Unstoppable Domains, whose technology makes it possible to replace lengthy and seemingly-random blockchain addresses with simple names that are easier to remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unstoppable Domains has been around since 2018 and to date has registered more than 2.5 million readable blockchain addresses. Its platform lets users create a crypto-centric domain extension, in order to replace their difficult-to-remember wallet addresses. So instead of a random string of 37 hexadecimal characters, you can create a fun name such as &ldquo;hotdog.bitcoin&rdquo; or &ldquo;superman.blockchain&rdquo; that&rsquo;s issued as an NFT, and easy for people to remember. More than 300 decentralized applications already support Unstoppable Domains wallet addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StormGain, which also offers a centralized trading platform, said its partnership with Unstoppable Domains will provide enhanced security and more convenient access to users of its platform. Security is improved because it&rsquo;s all too easy to make a mistake when typing out traditional crypto addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, StormGain said Unstoppable Domains is also being added as a new authorization method. What that means is users can authorize access to StormGain DEX using their Unstoppable Domains account, in order to trade cryptocurrencies directly with any wallet associated with that account. According to the company, this will simplify the onboarding process for new users and improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To encourage users to adopt an Unstoppable Domain wallet address, StormGain said it&rsquo;s offering a 25% discount on the price of any domain to all users. The offer will run for five days and automatically be applied at check out when users register a new address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StormGain said it&rsquo;s confident that its partnership with Unstoppable Domains will help to change the way people interact with, and own, crypto assets. It said its ongoing mission is to provide the best possible crypto trading experience for all users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Unstoppable Domains to offer our account users a more secure and convenient way to access our platform,&rdquo; a spokesperson for StormGain said.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As Web3 continues to evolve and reshape the internet, user-focused cryptocurrency wallets are becoming increasingly important. With decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms rising, the demand for seamless and user-friendly wallets is higher than ever. To meet the needs of a rapidly expanding user base, wallet providers must prioritize user experience, security, and interoperability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web3 Adoption Trucks Along Nicely</p>
<p>The adoption of Web3 is primarily driven by its potential to empower users through decentralization and digital ownership. However, the current landscape of cryptocurrency wallets often presents a significant barrier to entry for non-technical users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many wallets are difficult to navigate, have steep learning curves, and lack support for multiple cryptocurrencies or blockchain platforms. As a result, this usability gap could potentially hinder the widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. To bridge this gap, cryptocurrency wallets must become more user-focused, prioritizing ease of use, security, and support for diverse assets and platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, as the Web3 ecosystem grows, wallet providers should adapt to emerging technologies and trends, such as gasless transactions and integration with popular trading platforms like Robinhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Golden Opportunity For Wallet Providers</p>
<p>At Consensus 2023, Giddy emerged as a bright spot in user-focused wallets. Since its launch in January, Giddy has experienced rapid growth, with over 100,000 users joining the platform. One of the keys to its success has been its ability to adapt and innovate quickly. Giddy became the first wallet to introduce gasless transactions on the Polygon network, a significant step forward in addressing the persistent issue of high gas fees that plague the Ethereum ecosystem. It also became one of the first and most notable wallets to integrate with Robinhood Connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This integration enables users to trade cryptocurrencies seamlessly across both platforms, effectively bridging the gap between traditional financial services and the world of cryptocurrencies. This achievement highlights the importance of interoperability in the rapidly evolving Web3 landscape.</p>
<p>On the same day as the Robinhood Connect integration, Giddy announced that it had raised $6.9 million from notable investors, including Fortnite co-creator Geremy Mustard, who joined as a strategic investor. This influx of capital further solidifies the project's position in the market and underscores the growing demand for user-focused wallet solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Power of Robinhood Connect</p>
<p>Robinhood Connect, a new service introduced by the popular trading platform, has already gone live with support for several crypto wallets. Integration with other prominent wallets, such as Exodus and Phantom, will follow soon. This move by Robinhood highlights the trend toward seamless integration between traditional financial platforms and the emerging world of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>As the Web3 ecosystem expands, the need for user-focused wallet solutions will only grow more urgent. By prioritizing usability, security, and interoperability, wallet providers can ensure they remain relevant despite rapid technological advancements.</p>
<p>Wallet providers can successfully navigate the complex and evolving Web3 landscape. By focusing on user experience and embracing emerging technologies, projects can position themselves as leaders, setting a high standard for other wallet providers. In addition, there is still ample room for additional products and services as long as they adhere to a customer-first approach.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Polygon lending protocol 0VIX has announced a temporary halt to its POS and zkEVM operations because of an exploit costing the protocol at least $2 million.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">0VIX is working with its security partners to look into the current situation that seems to be related to vGHST.As a result, POS and zkEVM markets have been paused this includes pausing oToken transfers, minting, and liquidations.Only POS has been currently affected but zkEVM&hellip;</p>
&mdash; 0VIX | live on zkEVM (@0vixProtocol) April 28, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">A joint investigation with blockchain security firm PeckShield revealed that the attacker had managed to exploit the protocol using the vGHST token. vGHST is the staking token of the blockchain gaming project Aavegotchi. It is also the share token for $GHST, Aavegotchi&rsquo;s native token.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Blocksec, another security and audit firm, confirmed that vGHST was artificially inflated and its price oracle manipulated. The attacker had initially borrowed stablecoins which they used to open up lending on 0VIX and enabled them access to the vGHST lending pool. They then borrowed large amounts of vGHST. This caused the value of the native token $GHST to shoot up by as much as 24.7% in less than half an hour, as blockchain data from CoinMarketCap reveals. The attacker then ran off with the collateral and subsequently exchanged their loot for other tokens.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Attacks like these are commonly called oracle manipulation hacks. The crypto space has seen its fair share of these attacks, most recently with the Mango Markets hack last October 2022 where the attacker had made off with a whopping $117 million.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As for 0VIX&rsquo;s response, the protocol is not giving up as their joint investigation with PeckShield and Chainalysis has yielded significant results by managing to identify the attacker. An ultimatum was then switfly issued to the attacker via an on-chain message which 0VIX subsequently publicized in a tweet. It states that the protocol is willing to give the attacker $125,000 as bug bounty in return for the rest. Should the attacker not respond, 0VIX has warned that it will share information with law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The protocol has since issued the following statement, embedding the warning for the threat actor that law enforcement will be involved if no response is received:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Official message to the attacker:At 8am UTC 1 May 2023 the law enforcement process is scheduled to begin in the absence of any funds being returned.We will take the leads we've gotten so far (thank you to the public for these), combine it with our tracing we've already done on&hellip;</p>

<p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Hacks and exploits are a real problem, and not just in the crypto space, especially when safeguards are still not properly placed. Attacks like these raise important questions not simply on the security measures that individual exchanges and crypto projects deploy but more importantly, the path Ethereum itself is taking, or has taken, specifically its move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">The market is changing fast, and analysts believe some cryptocurrencies that were hot a few years ago may never see phenomenal growth.</p>
<p class="s3">Analysts see little of a future in two cryptocurrencies: Cronos (CRO) and Loopring (LRC). Analysts believe that the increasing curbs on crypto advertising hurt Cronos (CRO), while saturation of Ethereum layer 2 solutions means Loopring (LRC) may have seen better days.</p>
<p class="s3">However, in changing market dynamics, there is always a winner. This time, analysts expect Sparklo (SPRK) to outperform the rest of the market by a huge margin. Some even believe this cryptocurrency, which is still in the presale stage, could be destined for the top 100.</p>
<p class="s7">Cronos (CRO) Future Bleak As Crypto Advertising Faces Regulations</p>
<p class="s3">In the past, Cronos (CRO) has relied heavily on advertising to drive adoption. Cronos (CRO) even sponsored the last FIFA world cup, a testament to how heavily invested it is in advertising.</p>
<p class="s3">However, after the collapse of FTX, which was also quite heavy on advertising, many companies are avoiding crypto-related sponsorships. This means Cronos(CRO)'s avenues for creating awareness are dwindling. </p>
<p class="s3">At the same time, declining crypto prices and usage in the bear market means Cronos (CRO) revenues through Crypto.com have decreased. This means even when advertising opportunities arise, Cronos (CRO) team may need more resources to sustain such marketing. </p>
<p class="s3">There is also the aspect of competition. Cronos (CRO) transactions are costly, and more people are starting to realize it. This means Cronos (CRO) has to contend with other crypto payment networks that may be miles ahead in terms of transaction costs and speeds. </p>
<p class="s3">Besides so many factors playing against Cronos (CRO), its market cap is so high compared to where it was when it first hit the market. This makes Cronos (CRO) a crypto asset with diminishing returns. </p>
<p class="s3">That's why most investors are looking elsewhere, especially toward cryptocurrencies whose prices are still on the ground floor, such as Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s7">Loopring (LRC) Lost In A Sea Of Many Other Ethereum Layer-2s</p>
<p class="s3">Loopring (LRC) may have good fundamentals as a DEX for trading Ethereum tokens. However, there is nothing unique about such a value proposition. It makes Loopring (LRC) one of many L2s that are in the market today.</p>
<p class="s3">To make things worse, some of Loopring (LRC) 's competitors are much better known. This means that even as the Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem grows, Loopring (LRC) will likely get a minor share of the growth.</p>
<p class="s3">It is, therefore, not surprising that savvy investors are moving away from Loopring (LRC) and into newer, more innovative cryptos like Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo Continues To Attract Investors Seeking Parabolic Gains</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) is a major beneficiary as some cryptocurrencies fall out of favor with investors. </p>
<p class="s3">Investors are excited that Sparklo is still in the presale stage, which means they are getting in on the ground floor. The price is right, too, as Sparklo (SPRK) is going for a presale price of $0.015.</p>
<p class="s3">Besides the excitement of getting in early, investors love the Sparklo (SPRK) value proposition. Sparklo (SPRK) makes precious metals more accessible to the average investor by fractionalizing them as NFTs. </p>
<p class="s3">Investors also love that the Sparklo (SPRK) team has kept everything above board. InterFiNetwork thoroughly audits Sparklo (SPRK). Sparklo (SPRK) also has a KYC audit for maximum transparency. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking to add cryptocurrency to your investment portfolio? Look at Collateral Network (COLT), a project currently in its presale run that is predicted to soar by 35x soon. This is an excellent jump, with some experts even claiming it could provide more return on investment (ROI) than known coins such as Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE). </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano (ADA) </p>
<p>The Lace Wallet, IOG's first native Cardano (ADA) network wallet, was just made public. With direct access to the Cardano (ADA) network, this wallet allows users to run decentralized apps built on the Cardano (ADA) platform.</p>
<p>This news sparked a slight jump in the Cardano (ADA) value as, at the time of writing, it trades at $0.4352 with a market cap of $15 billion, up 5.15% in the past 24 hours. The trading volume for Cardano (ADA) has also increased by 63% in that same period, reaching $714,331,992.</p>
<p>A bullish sentiment can also be seen for the crypto, with most of the technical indicators for Cardano (ADA) currently showing buy signals. Experts predict that $0.55 may be the bulls' primary objective for the rest of the year. But, some Cardano (ADA) holders may find this valuation underwhelming as the all-time high of $3.09 may not be reached any time soon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Dogecoin (DOGE) </p>
<p>Elon Musk has reportedly offered a bounty of 1 million Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens to those who can prove that he has an emerald mine, suggesting that he is tired of the accusations. For Musk, who is listed as a billionaire on the Forbes list with a net worth of around $185 billion US dollars, this number of Dogecoin (DOGE) is pennies on the dollar. </p>
<p>After this claim, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a 2.50% jump and at the time of writing, has a value of $0.08924. The 24-hour trading volume for Dogecoin (DOGE) also rose by 3.78% and now stands at $864,057,273. </p>
<p>When looking at the technical analysis for Dogecoin (DOGE), we can see a neutral situation, with most of its technical indicators showing neutral signals.</p>
<p>According to experts, these charts show that interest in Dogecoin (DOGE) could wane, but investors must hold off and move past the resistance level of $0.10075. They predict that Dogecoin (DOGE) could reach $0.25 by December 2023, which could cause some investors to sidestep it as they look for projects with substantial long-term profitability. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="s3">Collateral Network (COLT) </p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) aims to disrupt the old-fashioned pawnbroking industry by bringingoff-chain assets onto the blockchain. This decentralized Web3 peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform will allow individuals from around the globe to borrow funds against physical items they own. </p>
<p>Assets such as vintage cars, rare art pieces, and jewelry can be used as collateral and sent to Collateral Network (COLT), which will take the first legal charge over the asset and mint an NFT backed by the item itself.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking to add cryptocurrency to your investment portfolio? Look at Collateral Network (COLT), a project currently in its presale run that is predicted to soar by 35x soon. This is an excellent jump, with some experts even claiming it could provide more return on investment (ROI) than known coins such as Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE). </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano (ADA) </p>
<p>The Lace Wallet, IOG's first native Cardano (ADA) network wallet, was just made public. With direct access to the Cardano (ADA) network, this wallet allows users to run decentralized apps built on the Cardano (ADA) platform.</p>
<p>This news sparked a slight jump in the Cardano (ADA) value as, at the time of writing, it trades at $0.4352 with a market cap of $15 billion, up 5.15% in the past 24 hours. The trading volume for Cardano (ADA) has also increased by 63% in that same period, reaching $714,331,992.</p>
<p>A bullish sentiment can also be seen for the crypto, with most of the technical indicators for Cardano (ADA) currently showing buy signals. Experts predict that $0.55 may be the bulls' primary objective for the rest of the year. But, some Cardano (ADA) holders may find this valuation underwhelming as the all-time high of $3.09 may not be reached any time soon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Dogecoin (DOGE) </p>
<p>Elon Musk has reportedly offered a bounty of 1 million Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens to those who can prove that he has an emerald mine, suggesting that he is tired of the accusations. For Musk, who is listed as a billionaire on the Forbes list with a net worth of around $185 billion US dollars, this number of Dogecoin (DOGE) is pennies on the dollar. </p>
<p>After this claim, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a 2.50% jump and at the time of writing, has a value of $0.08924. The 24-hour trading volume for Dogecoin (DOGE) also rose by 3.78% and now stands at $864,057,273. </p>
<p>When looking at the technical analysis for Dogecoin (DOGE), we can see a neutral situation, with most of its technical indicators showing neutral signals.</p>
<p>According to experts, these charts show that interest in Dogecoin (DOGE) could wane, but investors must hold off and move past the resistance level of $0.10075. They predict that Dogecoin (DOGE) could reach $0.25 by December 2023, which could cause some investors to sidestep it as they look for projects with substantial long-term profitability. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="s3">Collateral Network (COLT) </p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) aims to disrupt the old-fashioned pawnbroking industry by bringingoff-chain assets onto the blockchain. This decentralized Web3 peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform will allow individuals from around the globe to borrow funds against physical items they own. </p>
<p>Assets such as vintage cars, rare art pieces, and jewelry can be used as collateral and sent to Collateral Network (COLT), which will take the first legal charge over the asset and mint an NFT backed by the item itself. Afterward, this NFT will be fractionalized, and the Collateral Network (COLT) lender community will be able to purchase it partially - becoming fractional lenders and funding the loan in the process and able to receive a fixed interest weekly income. </p>
<p>The project liquidity pool will be frozen for 33 years while team tokens for 2 - eliminating any rug-pull fears. This fact, combined with 2FA security options, makes Collateral Network (COLT) one of the most secure investment options currently available. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Axie Infinity were among the top cryptocurrencies making headlines in 2020/21. Quite logical, given that Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Axie Infinity (AXS) were among the best performers at the time, doing thousands of percentages in gains.</p>
<p class="s3">But will Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Axie Infinity (AXS) repeat the magic of 2021? Analysts believe that the best days of these two high-profile cryptocurrencies are over. </p>
<p class="s3">Instead, analysts believe new cryptocurrencies that still have a tiny market cap will explode next. One cryptocurrency that analysts are particularly bullish on is Sparklo (SPRK), which is still in the presale stage. </p>
<p class="s3">With the attention that Sparklo (SPRK) is getting from investors, it could easily make it to the top 100 cryptos by market cap. </p>
<p class="s7">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Best Days Behind It</p>
<p class="s3">Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a perfect example that timing matters when investing. Those who got into Shiba Inu (SHIB) in 2020 or early 2021 made good money. Some early Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors became millionaires from investments as low as $500. </p>
<p class="s3">However, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) of today is far from that of 2020. Today, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a large-cap cryptocurrency. Expecting Shiba Inu (SHIB) to give another 1 million percent in gains would be expecting a bigger market cap than Bitcoin. That&rsquo;s simply unrealistic for Shiba Inu(SHIB).</p>
<p class="s3">Analysts also believe that even a few thousand percent gains for Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be unrealistic. That&rsquo;s because, unlike in 2020, hundreds of Shiba Inu (SHIB) competitors are coming to the market today. Since many have lower market caps, they stand to gain more than Shiba Inu (SHIB) in another crypto bull rally.</p>
<p class="s3">While Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now in the past, analysts believe Sparklo (SPRK) has the potential to repeat what Shiba Inu (SHIB). Sparklo (SPRK) has the hype, and it's still a low-cap crypto, just like SHIB in 2020.</p>
<p class="s7">Axie Infinity (AXS) Best Days Are Behind It</p>
<p class="s3">Analysts increasingly agree that Axie Infinity (AXS) has seen better days. Firstly, all the hype around P2E gaming that propelled Axie Infinity (AXS) to the limelight is long gone.</p>
<p class="s3">Most gamers have realized that the quality of games and rewards on Axie Infinity (AXS) and most P2E platforms does not match what you get in conventional gaming environments.</p>
<p class="s3">At the same time, even within the P2E gaming world, Axie Infinity (AXS) has lost its edge to newer cryptocurrencies with more games. </p>
<p class="s3">This is compounded by the fact that Axie Infinity (AXS) today has a large market cap. This means that even if the broader market rises again, Axie Infinity (AXS) will likely do something 3X.</p>
<p class="s3">That&rsquo;s pretty small compared to Sparklo (SPRK), which analysts predict could do 100X or more.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo All Set To Rally As Investors Seek 100X-Plus Gains</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) is getting much attention from investors seeking 100X or more gains. Can Sparklo (SPRK) deliver that? Analysts believe it can do so because it is still low-cap crypto, so there is room for growth. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) is still in the presale stage and currently going for only $0.015. This is a pretty affordable price for all levels of investors and could drive FOMO around Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s3">At the same time, investors are attracted to Sparklo (SPRK) for its high transparency. With Sparklo (SPRK), investors buy crypto whose smart contract is fully audited by InterFi Network. Sparklo (SPRK) also has a KYC audit to ensure everything is above board. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Perched Around 29370 Target:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 30 April 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) traded mostly sideways early in the Asian session as the pair hovered around the 29430.67 level, a downside price objective that became technically significant following selling pressure around the 30463.84 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Selling pressure recently strengthened around the 29900 area after BTC/USD topped out around the 30050.66 area, and buying pressure emerged around the 28900 level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were elected above the 27929.17, 28525.56, 29007.57, and 29489.58 areas during the recent surge higher, retracement levels associated with the recent depreciating range from 31050 to 26965.14.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also elected above the 28036.96 and 29370.70 areas during the appreciation, upside price objectives associated with recent buying pressure around the 27194.51 and 28161.74 areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional related upside price objectives include the 30420.74, 31237.11, and 32556.73 levels.&nbsp; Downside price objectives related to recent depreciating ranges and levels include the 26533, 26085, 25604, and 24103 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31477.37, 32501.23, 32989.19, 34583.96, 34658.69, 35222.66, 37765.28, and 38403.97 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another important price objective is the 31846.88 area, a level that represents the 50% retracement of the depreciating range from 48233.76 to 15460.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29094.57 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29349.91.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;26533.04/ 25604.51/ 25094.62 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain company Ripple has reported that it sold over $361 million worth of XRP tokens in the first three months of 2023 (Q1), according to the XRP Markets Report.</p>
Ripple&rsquo;s Stunning Growth&nbsp;
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s figures were a significant increase over the previous quarter when it had recorded sales of $226 million worth of XRP. The company published the figures in its latest XRP Markets Report for Q1 2023. Ripple has focused on creating global payment products. Ripple stated in its report,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Total XRP sales by Ripple in Q1 2023, net of purchases, were $361.06M v. $226.31M the previous quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In line with its vision, the company has developed the decentralized XRP payment system. Both Ripple and XRP are entirely different entities. However, Ripple uses XRP and its public blockchain to power the products it offers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s on-demand liquidity product fueled XRP&rsquo;s exceptionally high sales for Q1 2023. Ripple&rsquo;s on-demand liquidity helps users move funds around the world without requiring any intermediary or corresponding banking relationship.&nbsp;</p>
Strong On-Chain Activity&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, Ripple also reported strong on-chain activity, with its decentralized exchange volume rising by 34% from Q4 2022 and moving to $115 million.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain company Ripple has reported that it sold over $361 million worth of XRP tokens in the first three months of 2023 (Q1), according to the XRP Markets Report.</p>
Ripple&rsquo;s Stunning Growth&nbsp;
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s figures were a significant increase over the previous quarter when it had recorded sales of $226 million worth of XRP. The company published the figures in its latest XRP Markets Report for Q1 2023. Ripple has focused on creating global payment products. Ripple stated in its report,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Total XRP sales by Ripple in Q1 2023, net of purchases, were $361.06M v. $226.31M the previous quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In line with its vision, the company has developed the decentralized XRP payment system. Both Ripple and XRP are entirely different entities. However, Ripple uses XRP and its public blockchain to power the products it offers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s on-demand liquidity product fueled XRP&rsquo;s exceptionally high sales for Q1 2023. Ripple&rsquo;s on-demand liquidity helps users move funds around the world without requiring any intermediary or corresponding banking relationship.&nbsp;</p>
Strong On-Chain Activity&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, Ripple also reported strong on-chain activity, with its decentralized exchange volume rising by 34% from Q4 2022 and moving to $115 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;RP Ledger on-chain activity remained strong, with decentralized exchange volumes increasing 34% to $115M in Q1 2023 versus Q4 2022. XRP Average Daily Volume (ADV) on centralized exchanges jumped 46% in Q1 to $1B from $698M.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>CryptoUK today published a detailed response to His Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury&rsquo;s (HMT) Future Financial Services Regulatory Regime for Cryptoassets consultation paper.</p>
<p>CryptoUK, the trusted voice of the crypto industry in the United Kingdom, published a detailed response to His Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury&rsquo;s (HMT) Future Financial Services Regulatory Regime for Cryptoassets consultation paper.</p>
<p>Consultation proposals included strengthening rules for cryptocurrency trading platforms and a robust world-first regime for crypto lending. The consultation began in February and will close on 30 April 2023. Following its closure, the UK government will consider feedback and work to formulate a response to consolation proposals.</p>
<p>Su Carpenter, Director of Operations at CryptoUK, commented on the consultation, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe that a regulatory regime for cryptoassets is key to enabling the UK to be competitive as a destination for the fast-growing cryptoasset market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We support the &lsquo;same risk, same regulatory outcome&rsquo; approach and continued UK commitment to the development and promotion of international standards, given the cross-border nature of the crypto-asset industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carpenter further said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would welcome the UK taking a leading role in promoting safe and orderly cryptoasset markets given that this will both support the further development of the crypto industry as well as the competitiveness of the UK as a destination for crypto firms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Concluding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We welcome proactive engagement with industry by the HMT and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in preparation of both a UK crypto asset regulatory framework.</p>
<p>We suggest taking a broader view at all of the enablers for the UK to deliver on its ambition to become a global hub for the crypto industry, which includes a proportionate application of FinProm rules to trading venues, addressing concerns of de-banking by the crypto industry and progressive tax policy that addresses the nuances of the asset class.&rdquo;</p>

CryptoUK&rsquo;s Recommendations
<p>Su also detailed CryptoUK&rsquo;s specific recommendations on HMT&rsquo;s regime.</p>
<p>A predictable and transparent registration process:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We support an indicative timeline for the entire application process and welcome detailed, clear and upfront guidance on expectations towards industry by the FCA akin to the recent feedback statement on good and bad quality applications under the Money Laundering Regulations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pragmatic rules around disclosures:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe that disclosure requirements should provide the right information to consumers but not put disproportionate liability on trading venues. We also suggest international alignment with other jurisdictions to avoid multiple disclosure standards emerging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Custody and safekeeping of client assets are fundamental to building consumer trust:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trading venues should segregate holdings of cryptoassets on behalf of their clients from their own holdings, and make this verifiable through periodic on-chain checks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Setting a global standard for safe, transparent and orderly markets:</p>

<p>"We believe that the FCA can take a leading role globally in promoting safe, transparent and orderly markets through adoption of a phased approach where trading venues are first responsible for implementing market abuse rules on their own venues before adopting trade surveillance tools at a global level.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The creation of an asset-reference stablecoin category:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We acknowledge that only fiat-backed stablecoins are likely to be considered and/or allowed to be marketed as stablecoins or e-money. However, we believe a broader stablecoin category or regime that includes algorithmic stablecoins and crypto-backed tokens could be prudent, and would reflect the reality that these cryptoassets continue to have use cases in cryptoasset ecosystems, such as trading pairs."</p>

<p>DeFi remains nascent and non-systemic and may require new approaches:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are supportive of HMT&rsquo;s forbearance in seeking to develop a prescriptive framework for the regulation of DeFi before any international standards and approaches emerge. We would support a separate consultation of industry in the identification and development of industry best practices and potential novel supervisory approaches.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clarity on the regulatory treatment of staking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would support industry consultation on regulatory treatment of staking in the short term given its growing importance for the cryptoasset industry.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the US government approaches the deadline to raise its $13.4 trillion debt ceiling, how does this affect Bitcoin?</p>
The debt ceiling fiasco
<p>A periodic war between both parties in the US government is over the raising of the country&rsquo;s debt ceiling. It is always the case that the opposition party will take the governing party to the wire and extract as much advantage as it can before agreeing the new debt ceiling.</p>
<p>The debt ceiling is the maximum amount of debt that the US can borrow in order to meet its financial obligations. Analysts predict that the US could run out of money by Q3 or Q4 this year, while some are saying that weak tax receipts for April may bring the deadline forward.</p>
<p>If the US should somehow not be able to raise the debt ceiling in time it will default on its debts, something that is almost unthinkable for the US government, and would potentially lead to a global economic crisis.</p>
<p>So would a US debt default be good for Bitcoin?</p>
Bitcoin thrives in the good times
<p>Some might argue that a US debt default would lead to investors fleeing the dollar and seeking alternatives such as Bitcoin, gold, and other sound forms of money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it could also be argued that an economic crisis could lead to a drop in assets across the board, but this might only be temporary as investors would need to put their money somewhere, although it must be admitted that cash is traditionally where investors go first in a crisis.</p>
<p>Another bonus for Bitcoin could be when the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates and is forced to commence quantitative easing once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with inflation still hovering in the background the Fed will be walking a tightrope. With recession looking reasonably likely for the end of 2023 into 2024, the Fed will have to weigh up helping the economy out, against possibly sparking off inflation to the upside once again.</p>
Can Bitcoin flourish in bad times?
<p>Bitcoin tends to do much better in times when there is plenty of liquidity in the economy, but with ever-present inflation waiting to rear its ugly head, the Fed might feel that it can&rsquo;t step in.</p>
<p>The time has come when Bitcoin needs to step up and be a store of value in the good times as well as the bad. Should more banks start to fail then Bitcoin will need to step up and become that reliable store of value..</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US economy is sinking towards recession as GDP came in at only 1.1% for Q1. Bitcoin on the other hand is continuing its rise.</p>
Economic factors
<p>Probably the most important factor for economic well being is oil. Oil drives economies, and strong demand for it signals a healthy economy that is using oil to fuel its industrial base.</p>
<p>However, in these current times, in spite of OPEC countries reducing their output, the price of oil is continuing to decrease as demand falters due to falling economic growth.</p>
<p>In the US, GDP growth for Q1 dwindled to 1.1%. This was an unexpectedly sharp fall given that the projection had been for 2%. In addition, the fall was also dramatic given that GDP had been at 2.6% for Q4 of 2022.</p>
De-Dollarisation
<p>Another looming problem for the dollar is that de-dollarisation is happening. Other countries around the world are starting to move away from the dollar, probably due to its recent weaponisation by the US government, by imposing sanctions against any other country it does not agree with.</p>
<p>Russia is using yuan for trade, Argentina will pay for Chinese imports in yuan, India is settling some trades in rupees, Brazil and China are deciding whether to not use the dollar in trades between them, and Saudi Arabia is considering accepting the yuan for oil exports to China.</p>
<p>However, de-dollarisation will likely be a slow process, given that dollar exchange reserves are nearly twice those of the euro, yen, pound, and yuan combined, and this is the same as it was a decade ago.</p>
<p>The dollar accounts for 58% of all central bank foreign exchange reserves and this will probably not change any time soon. Nevertheless, a wind of change has begun to blow, and the dollar hegemony is on the wane.</p>
Dollar still in control
<p>Notwithstanding, the dollar has been described as the least dirty shirt in the laundry. It has its issues and detractors, but it is still the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, and all the other fiat currencies are much weaker.</p>
<p>The Brics nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are said to be developing a new reserve currency that will be backed by real substance, such as commodities.</p>
The evil of CBDCs
<p>Be that as it may, fiat currencies all go to zero over time and this has been proved throughout history. The only last throw of the dice for those wishing to maintain complete control, is the imposition of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<p>CBDCs would enable central banks to exert the kind of control that up to now could only be read about in science fiction books. CBDCs would give the power to micro manage an individual's account, including setting time limits on spending, deciding what can and can&rsquo;t be bought, and even direct sanctions should the individual do something that was thought to be against the interests of the State.</p>
Be your own bank with Bitcoin
<p>Among all this morass of fiat currency misery there is still one asset that is outside of the grip of governments and central banks, and that is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is completely decentralised, cannot be taken away, and enables an individual to be their own bank.</p>
<p>Banks are antiquated behemoths of a bygone age. They do not serve depositors given that they make the decision of who we can or can&rsquo;t transact with, they provide no return when inflation is taken into account, and if enough depositors demand their money at one time, the bank will fail given that it holds almost no deposits due to zero fractional reserve.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is cyclical, so history tells us that it does go up and down in price, sometimes quite wildly, but it is a nascent asset class and therefore it will take time for its volatility to subside.</p>
<p>The main thing is that it is the people&rsquo;s money, and it reduces the reliance people need to have on governments and the banks. As the evil of CBDCs approaches, it would be incumbent on all to do their best to research Bitcoin with a view to getting out of a crumbling and dangerous fiat monetary system.</p>

<p class="s7">However, the Internet Computer &nbsp;(ICP) token's sudden and dramatic plunge has left the crypto community in disarray, with some suspecting foul play by the project's creators. While Internet Computer &nbsp;(ICP) decline could be attributed to the general cryptocurrency market crash, a report by Arkham Intelligence raises suspicions of fraud. This in-depth analysis, comprising on-chain and off-chain data, reveals that massive transactions from addresses allegedly belonging to Dfinity treasury and project insiders account for 75% of the total Internet Computer &nbsp;(ICP) deposits to exchanges during this period.</p>
<p class="s7">Arkham Intelligence's report also calls attention to ethical concerns regarding Dfinity's project administration, accusing the organization of a lack of transparency in token allocation and unlocking processes. This intriguing crash of the Internet Computer &nbsp;(ICP) token has left investors with more questions than answers, casting a shadow of doubt over the project's future.</p>
