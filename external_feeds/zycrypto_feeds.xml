<p>Intercontinental Exchange-owned Bakkt has delisted Solana, Polygon, and Cardano, adding to a growing list of crypto firms ending support for the tokens amid a wave of regulatory uncertainty in the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bakkt-shakes-up-crypto-offerings-delists-ada-matic-sol"><strong>Bakkt Shakes Up Crypto Offerings, Delists ADA, MATIC, SOL</strong></h2>



<p>Regulatory pressures have led New York-based digital assets platform Bakkt to delist native tokens for prominent blockchains Solana, Polygon, and Cardano.</p>



<p>Bakkt’s general counsel and secretary Marc D&#8217;Annunzio <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/16/bakkt-delists-solana-polygon-cardano-regulatory-clarity/">told </a><em>Fortune </em>the firm was implementing changes “until there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The exchange Bakkt delisted ADA, MATIC, and SOL on the grounds of unclear supervision.  Bakkt delisted Algorand and Decentraland tokens amid the SEC lawsuit against Bittrex, and then voluntarily delisted 25 tokens in May.  Bakkt currently offers eight tokens including BTC, ETH,…</p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1669684096526860289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The delisting move comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed two lawsuits last week against cryptocurrency exchanges <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>. The regulator alleged that SOL, MATIC, ADA, and other digital assets were unregistered securities in both filings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Robinhood Started The Trend</strong></h2>



<p>Bakkt is at least the third company in recent days to axe tokens labelled as unregistered securities by the SEC. Popular trading app Robinhood <a href="https://zycrypto.com/robinhood-ceases-support-for-cardano-solana-and-polygon-after-sec-calls-them-securities/">cut support </a>for ADA, MATIC, and SOL on June 9. eToro followed suit on June 12, <a href="https://twitter.com/eToroUS/status/1668323758199955456">suspending </a>trading of Decentraland, Dash, Algorand, and Polygon for U.S. customers in light of the SEC’s recent legal action. This is not the first time eToro is delisting tokens in response to SEC-related pressure. In late 2020, the platform halted access to XRP shortly after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>Ripple. </p>



<p>That being said, Bakkt does not seem to be popular enough to impact investor sentiments or the market. The prices of ADA, SOL, and MATIC are up by 1.8%, 3.7%, and 1.1%, respectively, despite the company’s decision. </p>



<p>Still, Bakkt&#8217;s decision to halt support for major altcoins may influence other companies to follow suit.</p>

<p>The prospective entry of investment management firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-new-bitcoin-trust-could-be-the-catalyst-for-central-banks-investing-in-btc-dcgs-barry-silbert/">BlackRock</a> into Crypto has fed market curiosity and enthusiasm. According to a report by Reuters, BlackRock intends to introduce a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and has chosen Coinbase, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, to serve as the digital asset&#8217;s custodian. The announcement has shocked the cryptocurrency market, boosting expectations and igniting debates about the potential effects of such a move.</p>



<p>The rumours about BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF have led to a wave of speculative activity among investors and industry insiders. Even though the ETF&#8217;s specifics haven&#8217;t been confirmed, the news has sparked much interest and anticipation in the cryptocurrency industry. BlackRock&#8217;s entry into the market would be a significant turning point for cryptocurrencies, further establishing Bitcoin as a respectable asset class for investors.</p>



<p>According to Reuters, BlackRock has submitted a preliminary prospectus to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin ETF. As per the application, the ETF will make direct investments in Bitcoin rather than through futures contracts. Because Coinbase is a reputable and well-known company in the Crypto market, using them as the custodian for the coin lends credibility to the offering.</p>



<p>BlackRock&#8217;s engagement may draw institutional investors and open the door for a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies, given that it already manages over $9 trillion in assets. Due to the ETF&#8217;s design and affiliation with a respectable financial company like BlackRock, traditional investors may be able to access Bitcoin through a controlled and regulated channel.</p>



<p>On the other hand, BlackRock&#8217;s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF might be an instance of perception distorting reality. Current difficulties and legal barriers that earlier proposals for similar ETFs have encountered are still very much present. Even though the filing is a big accomplishment in and of itself, the SEC&#8217;s approval of the ETF is by no means guaranteed. Due to market manipulation and investor protection worries, previous applications for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-ruins-christmas-for-cryptocurrency-investors-with-yet-another-bitcoin-spot-etf-rejection/">Bitcoin ETFs were rejected</a>.</p>



<p>Investors are keenly following proceedings and anxiously expecting the SEC&#8217;s judgment due to the news from BlackRock, which has sparked a buzz in the cryptocurrency market. A BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, if approved, could draw large institutional capital inflows, possibly promoting broader development and general acceptance of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The prospective introduction of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock represents a significant step towards bridging the divide between traditional finance and the realm of digital assets as the Crypto market develops. If successful, this approach might significantly influence the course of cryptocurrencies and their absorption into the world financial system.</p>

<p>In a June 9, 2023 post on his website, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin outlined the three major technical transitions that the Ethereum protocol must undergo to offer an open, global, and permissionless experience to the average user.</p>



<p>According to Buterin, the three simultaneous transitions for Ethereum are; the Layer 2 (L2) scaling transition, the wallet security transition, and the privacy transition. Buterin says that intense coordination requiring deep changes from applications and wallets is required to achieve these transitions.</p>



<p>Buterin points out that smart contract wallets make the keeping of one address more difficult since some L2 blockchains are not compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM), yet privacy may require each user to have even more addresses. The EVM is software that executes smart contracts and updates Ethereum Network after a new block is added to the chain.</p>



<p>Buterin says that since many users&#8217; funds are stored in the same smart contract and hence at the same address, apps that rely on the assumption that address ownership is immutable will have to find alternative ways to achieve this goal.</p>



<p>For key recovery, Buterin proposes that instead of running the recovery procedure on each address separately, the wallet can include software to execute the recovery procedure across all of a user&#8217;s addresses at the same time.</p>



<p>However, considerations still need to be made on gas cost implications and privacy concerns over publicly linking all addresses by recovering them at the same time and hence proposes the use of an architecture that separates verification logic and asset holdings.</p>



<p>Buterin says that overcoming the above challenges requires lots of secondary infrastructure to be updated and wallets interacting with spending and encryption keys will have to be improved.</p>



<p>Buterin gives an example of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) that makes it a lot easier for regular users to minimize the possibility of using a wrong wallet address mistake considerably but is expensive. To enhance its use, Buterin says that ENS subdomains are now automatically verifiable on L2 blockchains.</p>



<p>Buterin says that although wallets are essential for securing assets, they also hold user data. Holding a single encryption key could resolve the protection of user data, however losing your encryption key, still results in loss of assets.</p>



<p>However, to avoid users having multiple recovery paths, Buterin proposes that wallets will likely need to manage both the recovery of assets and encryption keys.</p>



<p>Buterin further proposes that any chosen design should maintain decentralization while at the same time offering easy access to users’ assets using open and not proprietary solutions.</p>



<p>Buterin says that achieving the three technical transitions is crucial and Ethereum must rise to the challenge for improved user experience and to attain a sustainable future.</p>

<p>The last two weeks have been tough for the crypto industry in the US as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued Binance and Coinbase in a wave of regulatory crackdown.</p>



<p>This ripple effect affects other countries as local regulators started to take a tough stand against crypto. As a result, strategists say the industry may bow to pressure, and crypto exchanges will be registered with the SEC as the commission has always wanted.</p>



<p>However, the CEO of Blockstream, Adam Back, says the industry will survive the regulatory pressure mounted on it, and at the BTC Prague conference, Back expressed confidence that the crypto industry’s adaptability will enable it to come out of these trying times.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The system is antifragile,&#8221; </em>Back said<em>. &#8220;Something is a problem? They&#8217;ll do something else or create an economic incentive for somebody. Some other company that had a different strategy will get a large amount of users,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>One reason he’s so confident is that the industry is driven by user demand, which is increasing. As a result, users will always find alternatives even if crypto exchanges close down in their locations.</p>



<p>The industry has always faced regulatory pressure, but not of this magnitude. Since Gary Gensler became the chairman of the SEC, the commission has gone all out to regulate the crypto industry, despite a lack of regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>Crypto exchanges worldwide are making changes to ensure compliance with the commission&#8217;s guidelines, including delisting some trading pairs of cryptocurrencies recently tagged as securities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, crypto influencers and lobbyists have warned the commission not to overstep its boundaries in trying to enforce regulations in the industry. Several crypto establishments have expressed their opinions on the matter.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the process will lead to proper regulation by the legislature to give the industry clear guidance and direction to follow to ensure there are no breaches and that the industry thrives in the country.</p>

<p>On June 14, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained interest rates at the 5-5.25% target range after ten consecutive rate hikes. The Fed said it would assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. </p>



<p>According to the FOMC, although recent indicators suggested that economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace with robust job gains and a low unemployment rate, inflation remained elevated.</p>



<p>The FOMC said that it would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and is prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee&#8217;s goals of achieving maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the longer run.</p>



<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the May U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.1% in May 2023 after increasing 0.4% in April. Over the last 12 months, the all-items index increased by 4.0% before seasonal adjustment. Shelter and used cars and trucks contributed the most to the monthly increases.</p>



<p>In a June 15, 2023 press release, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) raised the three key ECB interest rates by 0.25%, effective June 21, 2023. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility, and the deposit facility will increase to 4.00%, 4.25%, and 3.50%, respectively.</p>



<p>The ECB noted that though inflation has been coming down, it is projected to remain too high for long. In the press conference following the ECB&#8217;s interest rate decision, Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, said that energy, food, and the war in Ukraine all posed upside risks to inflation.</p>



<p>Lagarde further said that though energy and food price inflation had trended lower in May 2023, past increases in energy costs were pushing up prices across the economy. According to the ECB&#8217;s Governing Council, future interest rate decisions will return inflation to the 2% medium-term target.</p>



<p>Shortly after the US Fed’s interest rate announcement, Bitcoin and Ether traded below US$25k and US$1,700, respectively. Most other major altcoins also witnessed price declines following the Fed interest rate announcement. </p>



<p>Analysts have attributed the fall in crypto prices to the possibility of further Fed interest rate hikes later in the year. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for July 25-26, 2023.</p>



<p>Following the ECB&#8217;s interest rate announcement, crypto prices have remained at relatively the same levels over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Prevalent blockchain platform <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-solana-polygon-prices-make-comeback-rally-as-foundations-fire-back-against-secs-security-label/">Cardano (ADA)</a> has generated a lot of curiosity as analysts have great hopes for its price performance by the end of 2023. Experts forecast significant milestones and tremendous upside potential for ADA, citing the platform&#8217;s solid foundations and expanding ecosystem. However, investors&#8217; worries over recent price swings have sparked discussions over what causes the market volatility for ADA.</p>



<p>Sebastian Purcell, CEO of 1.2 Capital Management, predicts that Cardano prices will rise since the recent drop in ADA&#8217;s price caused by SEC-related worries has abated and it is likely that concerned investors have liquidated their holdings. The analyst predicts that the Ripple case&#8217;s verdict will substantially impact the price of ADA. If Ripple wins, ADA might increase to a low $.50 range. Even during a future bull market, ADA might find achieving its prior all-time high challenging if the result is unfavourable. He emphasized the importance of monitoring the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-the-outcome-of-sec-v-ripple-case-could-shape-crypto-markets-as-xrp-army-eagerly-awaits-verdict/">Ripple case</a> since it may affect ADA performance.</p>



<p>Other analysts have different estimates ranging from $5 to $10, demonstrating the consensus among analysts that ADA will rise. These projections are based on Cardano&#8217;s growth in terms of user base, interoperability, and functionality. Due to its innovative approach to decentralized finance, Cardano is heralded as a possible game-changer in the crypto space.</p>



<p>Parallel to this, important Cardano metrics have sharply increased, indicating a bullish market. According to data from analytics firm Santiment, the number of active addresses, the volume of transactions, and social media involvement have increased yearly. This increase in important metrics shows how the Cardano ecosystem is generating more interest and engagement. User involvement and participation have increased due to the platform&#8217;s developments in decentralized applications (dApps) and emphasis on sustainability and scalability.</p>



<p>However, recent market changes have made Cardano&#8217;s price performance uncertain. According to CoinMarketCap, ADA experienced a significant 20% price decline in the last seven days, which alarmed holders. The drop prompted discussions regarding the likely causes of the fall. Some theorize that profit-taking and the general market mood have impacted the decrease in ADA&#8217;s price. Understanding that the choppy crypto market frequently experiences price changes and that a brief decline does not necessarily rule out Cardano&#8217;s long-term potential is essential.</p>



<p>While analysts continue to be upbeat about Cardano&#8217;s future development, investors must carefully weigh both advantages and disadvantages when assessing the long-term potential of ADA.</p>



<p>The uptick in key measures and the bullish price forecasts for 2023 are signs of rising engagement in the Cardano ecosystem. However, recent price swings serve as a reminder of the Crypto market&#8217;s inherent volatility. Crypto adherents will follow <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-reveals-exciting-vision-for-cardano-ada-this-summer/">Cardano&#8217;s development</a> as it strengthens its position and keeps innovating, and they will base their judgments on a thorough evaluation of the platform&#8217;s potential.</p>

<li>Block’s self-custody Bitcoin wallet, Bitkey, will integrate Coinbase and CashApp, making it seamless for users to trade their assets. </li>



<li>The company also plans to partner with Coinbase One to enable users to convert their assets to fiat later this year.</li>



<li>Jack Dorsey’s Bitcoin investments, from mining to self-custody, have been hailed as a shining light to be emulated by other BTC executives.</li>
</ul>



<p>The general public will be able to take part in the beta test of Bitkey in a few weeks according to Block, its parent company striking the excitement of users.</p>



<p>Jack Dorsey’s payment company Block has announced a special integration of CashApp and leading US digital asset exchange Coinbase on its self-custody wallet, Bitkey. This new feature will let users withdraw from their wallets in both Coinbase and CashApp directly from Bitkey. </p>



<p>The company noted that an open beta program will be available to the general public rather than former ones which were restricted to its staff. According to the announcement, users can test the hardware device alongside other software for free, a move that spiked its value by 4%.</p>



<p>“<em>You’ll be asked to try out the product with your bitcoin, and share your feedback with us via interviews and surveys, which will help us shape the product. You’ll get to keep your free Bitkey hardware device to continue using with future versions of the app,” </em>the announcement reads.</p>



<p>The hardware wallet would include both PIN code and biometric authentication for added safety. The company will also incorporate third-party exchanges to allow users to purchase Bitcoin through integrated apps. Bitkey explained that its recent partnerships are part of its effort to become empower 100 million users while driving up adoption.</p>



<p>“<em>Back in March, we explained how partners can contribute to Bitkey’s mission to empower the next 100 million people to truly own and manage their money with Bitcoin,” the blog post states. “These partnerships represent a key step towards helping customers have more control and ownership over their financial lives with Bitcoin self-custody.” </em>the company stated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jack-dorsey-still-has-more-to-offer"><strong>Jack Dorsey still has more to offer</strong></h2>



<p>Jack Dorsey has remained bullish on Bitcoin over other digital assets over the years with contributions in payment solutions, mining, and hardware wallets. Dorsey pledged $5 million to Bitcoin developers this month through his relief fund Start Small.</p>



<p>Last year, the tech CEO also made rounds with his huge investment in renewable energy Bitcoin mines amid criticisms on the impact of Proof-of-work assets on the environment. Dorsey also unveiled plans for a high-end mining kit as well as a nano BTC mining chip. This year will come with the Bitkey wallet alongside several innovations.</p>



<p>Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/announcing-a-global-partnership-with-blocks-bitkey-wallet">announced</a> that its partnership with Bitkey would include a “<em>joint offer” </em>with Coinbase which rolls out this year allowing users to convert their assets to fiat. Bitkey is expected to be launched later this year across many jurisdictions including the United States, UK, Brazil, Australia, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>An ancient Bitcoin investor has made a whopping $1.2 million after moving dormant assets for the first time in 13 years.</li>



<li>Experts share their opinions on IT geeks and a few institutional investors who bought assets in the Satoshi era.</li>



<li>The falling price of BTC to its three-month low could be seen as a factor that occasioned the sale.</li>
</ul>



<p>This year has marked the resurrection of several Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin whales due to gains recorded in the market after the turmoil of 2022, which saw most assets lose nearly 50% of their value.</p>



<p>A Bitcoin whale has sold 50 BTC, acquired in 2010 after 13 years of inactivity, making $1.2 million at present prices. According to blockchain data, the wallet <a href="https://explorer.btc.com/btc/address/13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i">address</a> <em>13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i</em> received the coins in June 2010, leaving many digital asset enthusiasts wondering why the decision was made to transfer the assets 13 years later in June.</p>



<p>Bitcoin whales are large-scale investors who are known for this hoarding behaviour as they mostly sell a significant portion of their stash after many years. As a result of their deep pockets, the activities of bigger whales can swing the direction of the markets, unlike small-scale retail investors.</p>



<p>It is still unclear if this whale was a corporate investor or an IT geek, as computer geeks dominated the BTC market at that time. A developer Kirill Kretov noted that it is quite possible for “<em>IT Geeks” </em>to hold the stash but added that “<em>some commercial entity acquired those wallets from individuals in some later years, preserving the status of those addresses in blockchain.”</em></p>



<p>The price of BTC is at $25,550, recovering from its recent slump below $25,000 for the first time in three months after the Feds hinted that there might be more interest rate hikes in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-trend-continues-amid-shaky-prices"><strong>The trend continues amid shaky prices</strong></h2>



<p>This year has seen many old BTC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ancient-bitcoin-wallet-comes-back-to-life-after-12-years-owner-rakes-millions-in-profits/">stashes</a> return into circulation after many years of inactivity. In April, two huge transactions were recorded as a 10-year-old stash was moved for about $7.8 million, and just days after, $11 million worth of assets were transferred. </p>



<p>In Sep 2021, a whopping $30 million in assets was moved after it was acquired for $8,195 nine years ago. Although the resurrection isn’t peculiar to this year, a growing number has come in recent months. The reason cited is the market recovery so far wiping off losses of 2022. Last year, BTC plummeted over 55%, touching new lows not posted in months.</p>



<p>Observers say the surge in the market has led to whales looking to pick up profits after years of hodling while others suggest that recent regulatory crises are another factor.</p>

<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Sturdy Finance, lost 442 ETH (approximately $765,000 at the time of this publication) due to a security vulnerability exploited by some hackers.</p>



<p>The blockchain security company, <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1668067645638299648">PeckShield</a>, alerted the DeFi protocol on Twitter about fraudulent transactions through which attackers manipulated prices on the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are aware of the reported exploit of the Sturdy protocol. All markets have been paused; no additional funds are at risk, and no user actions are required at this time,&#8221; affirmed Sturdy Finance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sturdy-finance-loses-765-000-in-eth"><strong>Sturdy Finance loses $765,000 in ETH</strong></h2>



<p>The DeFi platform confirmed that it was a victim of the attack and sent a message to its users, assuring them that the necessary measures have been taken to prevent further funds from being stolen from the protocol.</p>



<p>However, the hacker managed to steal over $765,000 in ETH, which was sent to a cryptocurrency mixer.</p>



<p>According to the security firm <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1668084629654638592">BlockSec</a>, the attacker of Sturdy Finance exploited the read-only reentrancy in the protocol&#8217;s price balancer to manipulate the price of the BstETH-STABLE pair.</p>



<p>&#8220;This technique is commonly used by <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hackers-steal-23-million-in-ether-shiba-inu-and-other-tokens-from-singaporean-exchange-bitrue/">hackers</a> to withdraw funds from DeFi protocols,&#8221; says BlockSec.</p>



<p>It involves taking advantage of the ability to repeatedly call a function in a single transaction before the first function call has been completed. Thanks to this, hackers can withdraw more money than should be possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sturdy Finance hack exposes the vulnerability of DeFi platforms</strong></h2>



<p>Attacks on DeFi platforms have increased over time, leading many to consider this ecosystem a paradise for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/north-korean-hackers-linked-to-45-of-3-8-billion-crypto-theft-in-2022-chainalysis-reports/">hackers</a>. The theft of $625 million from Ronin Bridge and the $197 million stolen from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/euler-finance-197-million-hack-bears-links-with-north-korea-but-it-could-all-be-one-big-misdirection/">Euler Finance</a> are just examples of the vulnerability of these platforms.</p>



<p>Due to financial transactions in DeFi occurring on the blockchain without intermediaries, there is an inherent risk. This lack of regulation and decentralization makes decentralized finance platforms vulnerable to attacks.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, DeFi has continued to evolve and demonstrate impressive growth. However, it is necessary for security also to evolve to create a safer environment for users.</p>

<ul>
<li>Top assets lost value this week, with ADA shedding 22% and market leader BTC plunging to new lows not recorded in months. </li>



<li>The wider market was hit with deep losses wiping off $40 billion from the total market cap in 24 hours.</li>



<li>Observers say the market had a slow adverse reaction to the Fed&#8217;s uncertain stance on interest rate hike before the full impact on Thursday.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $25,000 for the first time in three months after the Feds signalled more interest rate hikes could be implemented.</p>



<p>The digital asset market was a sea of red as many coins posted weekly losses. Leading the losses in the top 20 by market capitalization was Polygon (MATIC), which plunged 24.1% and 8% in the past 24 hours. Solana (SOL) recorded a loss of 22.8% to trade at $14.54. </p>



<p>The past seven days have seen Cardano (ADA) lose slight gains it picked up this month. The community dubbed <em>ETH Killer </em>shed 22% of its value this week and 7% over the past 24 hours. XRP also saw a price correction after its community went into a frenzy following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-demands-investigation-into-former-sec-director-hinman-and-his-controversial-speech/">revelation</a> of the Hinman documents. XRP exchanges hands at $0.475 after losing 5.44% in the past week. </p>



<p>Other altcoins posted huge losses, including Polkadot (DOT), BNB, Avalanche (AVAX) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which recorded losses of 13.96%, 12.4%, 19.4%, and 17%, respectively. BTC bulls were left stunned after the asset dropped below the $25,000 mark for the first time in three months. At press time, BTC trades at $24,950, with several on-chain metrics pointing upwards for the asset. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-feds-keep-market-on-edge"><strong>Feds keep market on edge</strong></h2>



<p>At the release of the recent Consumer Protection Index (CPI), the entire market anticipated a renewed push for most assets as many predicted the Feds would end the 14-month hike in interest rates. Although interest rates were maintained after positive inflation data, the Feds noted that rates could still go up towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>A rate hike is detrimental to the market as it blunts investor excitement leading to a departure from risky assets. According to Josh Gilbert, an eToro market analyst.</p>



<p>“<em>Much of the positivity we’ve seen from risk assets this year, including Bitcoin, is built on the expectation that inflation will fall and interest rates will peak, and then begin to be cut. Inflation is moving in the right direction but the comments from Jerome Powell signify that rates could stay higher for longer, which would put Bitcoin on the back foot,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stock market also reacted similarly to cryptocurrencies following comments from the Feds as both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq dropped points.</p>

<p>Latest on-chain data shows the Ripple network is expanding as the number of new XRP addresses increases.</p>



<p>According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, these increases in addresses usually signal a potentially significant price growth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cuwa9LGQxoGDiSDABAaQ6P2zrC3ytnAdD_LAlZfP4eUYi9IDwgs4plhQeeKgQgWr20ihEioYpj3HWG2aApmQJPAnuTWw7_-NUlFwn3egazCFnULKOmG2g8nN04X7jU3FmcIThKzTMEbgCpQ3YASMuBg" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Network Growth (XRP). Source: Santiment</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-xrp-preparing-for-its-next-rally"><strong>Is XRP preparing for its next rally?</strong></h2>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-new-boom-for-xrp-record-breaking-address-activity-indicates-upturn-ahead-to-1-xrp-price/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, the surge in new addresses helped drive the price of XRP above the psychological resistance of $0.50, reaching a peak of $0.056 on Tuesday as the XRP Army continue to envison the $10 price point.</p>



<p>Although the increase in addresses could be a bullish signal suggesting the next XRP rally, it&#8217;s not a completely reliable indicator.</p>



<p>Investors focus on the outcome of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that XRP is a Security. Recently, District Judge Annalisa Torres ordered the inclusion of former SEC director William Hinman&#8217;s speech in the case documents, where he stated that Ether is not a Security token.</p>



<p>The use of these documents is crucial for Ripple in the case, as it could help the company demonstrate that, like ETH, XRP is not a security token.</p>



<p>Additionally, a victory in the Ripple lawsuit could have significant implications for the price of XRP and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. According to several experts, Ripple and its token are undervalued, considering the company&#8217;s reserves exceed four times its market value. Furthermore, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">Ripple has expressed its desire to go public</a>, generating significant interest from institutional investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP retreats 7.4%</strong></h2>



<p>Today, the price of XRP experienced a 5.4% retreat, according to CoinGecko data, following the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">SEC lawsuit</a> against Binance.US, Binance International, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. The lawsuit alleges that the exchange allowed North American users to use the international platform without regulatory permission to operate an unauthorized security token.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they were accused of using unauthorised user funds, transferring them to other international entities, thus evading federal laws.</p>



<p>However, despite the current decline of XRP, several indicators, such as moving averages, VPVP, and ADX, among others, continue to project a bullish trend on daily timeframes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y4Usp67GHk8PYDgNKdZHdJvr75RaboxyhU9wEsPhZwcDCGogmJqrOdrFk2vlsgYeASGHUBwLxO7yVmttjkQNNgSomeMdYZEgXzY0qjqWY8q7O6Ybz-yYcgJ90yR7977eKy-8PPLXD2PpCSU4SsK95Uk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Therefore, XRP needs to respect the support zone to maintain its bullish movement above $0.45. If it stays above that zone in the coming days, it could likely target the next resistance at $0.60 in the short term.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, has continued to trade sluggishly since mid-April, with last week’s regulatory scares pushing its price below $26,000.</p>



<p>However, since Monday, the top cryptocurrency has exhibited unexpected resilience, with investors temporarily setting aside concerns over Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-attorney-is-ready-to-go-to-bat-for-binance-coinbase-users-in-fight-against-sec/">Binance and Coinbase</a> and turning their attention to the upcoming Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate decision.</p>



<p>Notably, the retracement of Bitcoin, especially since last year&#8217;s decline, has generated a surge of curiosity, enticing many investors to seize the opportunity by purchasing the dip.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode reported that Bitcoin &#8220;Shrimps&#8221; and &#8220;Crabs&#8221; have increased their holdings significantly, accumulating nearly 1 million BTC since the collapse of the cryptocurrency LUNA in May 2022. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-enters-full-accumulation-season-with-shrimps-and-whales-seizing-their-share-of-the-pie/">Shrimps</a> are entities that hold less than 1 BTC while crabs are those that own less than 10 BTC.</p>



<p><em>“Following the LUNA collapse, Bitcoin entities with less than 10 BTC (Shrimps &#8211; Crab) have shown their resilience, increasing their relative share of the circulating supply from 13.72% to 17.54%, a 3.82% increase equivalent to +790K BTC.”</em> Tweeted Glassnode.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lG0Q26l4_QhC6JpG3_ykps1Eq0s5rKP4WuQvJyc4BlO8AohPpmMccbKEO8nhq-CQKY-3d0j34SfZQKSS93pWyojIInA0F49ZbuU2FnaamoYT6fLES2CuJE7WEW5IkUo-4rlZn9R8UxPgwoCcu4Cz2g" alt=""/></figure>



<p>But this is not the only cohort that is buying the dip. Another firm, Santiment, noted a bullish trend in Bitcoin&#8217;s accumulation patterns despite the falling price. As the altcoin market experienced a frenzy, Santiment highlighted a divergence between Bitcoin&#8217;s accumulating whales and the declining price.</p>



<p>According to the firm, Whale holdings in Bitcoin increased by approximately 1,000 BTC daily, indicating that more prominent investors were accumulating more Bitcoin even as prices dropped.</p>



<p><em>“With whale holdings moving up by ~1K $BTC per day while prices fall, there is reason to believe a strong rebound can occur,”</em> tweeted the firm.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, other Bitcoin metrics also seem to be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-on-chain-metrics-in-excellent-shape-despite-price-plunge-analyst-says/">improving</a>. According to Glassnode data, Bitcoin&#8217;s short-term holders have experienced a significant profit-driven phase since the start of the year. However, as the spot price of Bitcoin continued to trend lower, the STH (Short-Term Holders) Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has now approached a critical decision point, indicating an equilibrium position.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9MfOwnWqN4ytYZ56RRY10sansYroK7p8BMw6_UrXm0lqLWgoCShHq0gPeo1PMKSxlJbLILoXrf-sCtqr2pRBY_YsXnFs1m6mx4hFEtPC4TSNkN4dv7Q86NhgdHW9Rn7lf58R1e05M1rs1b0YcByqRA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Glassnode suggested on Tuesday that a bounce off the equilibrium position “would be considered constructive”, signalling support for Bitcoin. Conversely, if the ratio decisively falls below the equilibrium point, it would indicate market weakness and the possibility of more price drops. The market thus awaits this pivotal moment to assess the future trajectory of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC was trading at $25,114, down 3% in the past 24 hours. Notably, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price range is regarded as robust support. Further, the presence of a bullish flag pattern and inverse head and shoulders patterns suggest the possibility of an upcoming bullish rally.</p>

<p>Hours after the public release of the infamous William Hinman emails, cryptocurrency payments service provider Ripple called for a thorough investigation into the former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) director Bill Hinman and his now-released June 2018 speech, in which he said bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were not securities, in his view.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hinman-should-be-probed-ripple"><strong>Hinman Should Be Probed: Ripple</strong></h2>



<p>Documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">released to the public</a> Tuesday, shedding some light on the internal deliberations among SEC staffers that happened at the time.</p>



<p>And Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty calls for a fresh investigation into Hinman. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1668601239536390144">series of tweets</a> on Tuesday, Alderoty explained the need to uncover the reasons behind his infamous ether speech and the application of the Howey test.</p>



<p>In that speech given in 2018, Hinman declared that Ethereum (ETH) shouldn’t be categorized as a security because it was “sufficiently decentralized,” something that caused bewilderment when the SEC later filed a lawsuit against Ripple for allegedly selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP tokens as unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Alderoty inferred Hinman had overstepped his bounds by creating law without the authority.</p>



<p>“Unelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction. They can’t — as Hinman tried — create new law.“</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Hinman Issue</strong></h2>



<p>Looking at the behind-the-scenes edits and correspondence about the speech, Alderoty notes that the ex-director “invented factors” that should be considered when deciding what “sufficiently decentralized” actually is.</p>



<p>The legal officer said the docs demonstrated that Hinman ignored multiple warnings that the speech contained “made-up analysis with no basis in law” and caused “greater confusion” in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Besides launching a probe into Hinman, Alderoty pressed the SEC also to remove the speech from its website. He further urged that the speech should no longer be invoked in discussions about whether or not a token is a security.</p>



<p>“Despite the SEC repeatedly flip-flopping on the significance of the speech in litigation, it remains on the agency’s website,” the Ripple chief legal officer posited.</p>

<p>There’s a rumour going around Twitter claiming that Binance has been secretly selling Bitcoin to keep its BNB token afloat. Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao has quickly dispelled the speculation, proclaiming that no BTC or BNB trading activity is happening behind the scenes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cz-rebukes-claims-of-secretly-selling-btc-to-prop-up-bnb"><strong>CZ Rebukes Claims Of Secretly Selling BTC To Prop Up BNB</strong></h2>



<p>On Tuesday, popular crypto trader going by the online alias 52kskew accused Binance of intentionally manipulating the market to keep the prices of BNB from dropping below certain levels.</p>



<p>“USDT reserves have been pumped into BNB aggressively since 27th May. BNB is being sold off for BUSD to suppress volatility in BTC,” 52kskew astutely <a href="https://twitter.com/52kskew/status/1668726427703996418">noted</a>. “BUSD is pumped into BTC to suppress downside volatility so BTC can be swapped out for USDT.”</p>



<p>Similarly, trader JW100x claimed that Binance is determined to keep the price of BNB above $220 at all costs to prevent a “liquidation waterfall”. JW100x described the practice of selling spot Bitcoin to stabilize the value of BNB as a “total house of cards”, pointing to the potential for market destabilization.</p>



<p>Joe Consorti, a market analyst at The Bitcoin Layer, also <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeConsorti/status/1668723869794926595">described </a>BNB’s price action as “unusual”, with the “$220 level” being “staunchly defended.” He indicated that it might be a liquidation zone for a BNB-collateralized loan.</p>



<p>CZ felt compelled to quickly respond to these allegations on Twitter, dismissing them as FUD via his infamous “4” moniker. For those who don’t know, FUD stands for “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” The crypto community has long used the pejorative to portray what they deem as misconceptions or exaggerations circulated by crypto foes to scare off investors, regulators, and the general public.</p>



<p>According to the Binance boss, Binance has not sold any BTC or BNB. He added that the exchange still holds a bag of the FTX (FTT) token, a popular crypto asset issued by the now-defunct FTX digital asset exchange.</p>



<p>Zhao further <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1668735411705765893">accused</a> the Crypto Twitter members of supposedly spreading the rumours of self-serving intentions: “Maybe they are shorting… who knows.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fresh Binance FUD Or Facts?</strong></h2>



<p>CZ’s emphatic rebuff, however, has been met with harsh skepticism from the cryptoverse, with Consorti <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeConsorti/status/1668741759629762561">prompting </a>Binance to publish an audited statement proving that it doesn’t have any BNB-collateralized liabilities in order for the FUD to go away.</p>



<p>In the highly volatile crypto world, such grave allegations could shake market confidence and attract further regulatory scrutiny. Notably, the rumours come as the global exchange is mired in a legal spat with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of considerable malfeasance and federal securities violations at its Binance.US unit.</p>



<p>Earlier today, a federal judge refused to order a temporary restraining order freezing Binance.US’s assets. This will allow the U.S. arm of the firm to continue doing business while hashing out limitations with the agency.</p>



<p>Whether Binance will provide evidence to corroborate CZ&#8217;s claims or if these allegations will further taint the company’s reputation remains to be seen.</p>
