<ul>
<li>The testnet is currently undergoing an audit to remove bugs and possible vulnerabilities.</li>



<li>Polygon zkEVM is touted as the highest level of scalability for Ethereum.</li>
</ul>



<p>Polygon launched the last testnet before the rollout of the zkEVM scalability solution, which bundles transactions to increase speed and reduce gas fees. The layer-2 network has also announced an audit of the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Researchers at Polygon are introducing the pioneering use of recursion in a zkEVM, resulting in batch aggregation. In addition, an optimized prover now generates proofs for a batch in under 4 minutes (down from 10,)</em>&#8221; the company wrote on its official website.</p>



<p>The testnet has incorporated all the required features of zkEVM for the final deployment. It enables Polygon zkEVM to confirm a batch of ZK proofs – where each will track multiple transactions. According to the announcement, bundling many transactions into a single proof is the top level of scalability with equivalence to the EVM.</p>



<h2 id="h-zkevm-public-testnet-milestone-and-its-relevance-in-defi"><strong>ZkEVM Public Testnet Milestone And Its Relevance In DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>Termed the ‘holy grail’ of scalability, Polygon <a href="https://zycrypto.com/matic-primed-for-huge-shakeup-as-polygon-records-huge-milestone-for-ethereum-scaling-with-zkevm/">announced zkEVM</a> public testnet on October 10, 2022. The testnet, according to the developers, has attracted interest from notable EVM-based DeFi protocols like Aave.</p>



<p>While launching the testnet, the layer 2 network said integrating Zero-Knowledge proofs with Ethereum Virtual Machine was the most challenging step. It noted that testnet could prove that zkEVM generates ZK proofs within its EVM-equivalent environment.</p>



<p>During the launch, Polygon added that it needed to achieve the top level of EVM compatibility to reach type-2 EVM compatibility, where Polygon zkEVM would be like Ethereum from within. Currently, the scalability upgrade is limited in speed and capacity.</p>



<p>Polygon says the public testnet would enable it to &#8220;<em>debug, stabilize, and get ready for audits before the mainnet launch.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>ZkEVM is a layer 2 construction on Ethereum that addresses scalability with mass transfers merged into a single transaction. The platform&#8221; <em>records the validity and correctness of bundled transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.</em>&#8221; In addition, the blockchain enhances the network&#8217;s speed by keeping only the transfer&#8217;s proofs and the bundled data.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s co-founder and CEO of IOHK, has taken a swipe at <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-waives-usdt-to-usdc-conversion-fees-shortly-after-binance-ditched-usdc/">Coinbase</a> for leaving Cardano out in its “2023 Crypto Market Outlook” report to institutional clients.</p>



<p>The report, which sought to expound how the dramatic events of 2022 will shape the crypto landscape for years to come, apparently left out Cardano, one of the largest crypto networks in the ecosystem, choosing to discuss only Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>Following the report, Hoskinson tweeted, <em>“Not a single mention of Cardano. Pretty low and pretty sad. I honestly expected better.”</em></p>



<p>The tweet sparked mixed reactions, with a significant number of observers bashing Coinbase for willful neglect.</p>



<p><em>“I was recently curious why NEWS and COMMUNITY UPDATES on Coinbase, under Cardano,</em> are out of date. Is that Coinbase&#8217;s job to keep it updated? How come Solana has recent news?” one follower replied, referring to the exchange’s community updates section, which has continued to post other coins, leaving out Cardano since October.</p>



<p>Others chose to support Hoskinson by sharing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-reigns-as-the-most-developed-crypto-asset-as-ada-leaps-forward/">Cardano’s milestones</a>. Cardano Foundation, the Swiss non-profit promoting the Cardano protocol&#8217;s growth, outlined some Cardano highlights for 2022. In a thread of tweets, the foundation noted that the Cardano ecosystem had experienced explosive on-chain growth. As of Dec 21, there were 3.80M Cardano wallets, of which 1.2m are delegated, marking a 47% increase from last year. Transactions count on the network also shot by 139% to 56.9M in the same period.</p>



<p>Notably, in September, the Cardano team executed the Vasil upgrade, which promised to improve the scalability and smart contract functionality of the Cardano network. Although we are yet to see an explosion in Cardano DeFi due to the upgrade, experts believe things could change in 2023.</p>



<p>The Cardano team has been working on Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) 1694, an upgrade that will lay the foundation for community governance and self-sustainability for the Cardano ecosystem. Through the proposal, Cardano is set to become fully decentralized <em>“so much so that even IOHK, Emurgo and Cardano foundation cant be making all the decisions,”</em> according to crypto-focussed YouTuber Cryptorus.</p>



<p>In the past year, the Cardano foundation also strengthened its mission and core values by partnering and collaborating with more than ten leading institutions worldwide, including the National Wine Agency of Georgia and the UNHCR.</p>



<p>ADA whale, a Twitter service that specialises in providing community updates on the Cardano ecosystem, also announced that it would be starting a new series called “LatestOnCardano” to cover news on Cardano’s vibrant ecosystem, which often goes unreported.</p>



<p><em>“In this series, I highlight base layer upgrades, statistics, dapps, SPOs, NFTs, governance and community. All things Cardano. Irregular but hopefully frequent,”</em> wrote ADAwhale.</p>

<p>Veteran investor Bill Miller is talking bitcoin again. Miller, who has managed billions of dollars worth of funds and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-is-insurance-against-financial-catastrophe-asserts-billionaire-investor-bill-miller/">allocated 1%</a> of his net worth to Bitcoin, told <em>Barron </em>recently bitcoin has performed incredibly well in recent weeks despite the fallout from the industry-shaking collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. While some may expect the FTX downfall to prolong the crypto winter, the mutual fund titan remains optimistic about the performance of the benchmark cryptocurrency in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>Bitcoin’s Resilience Is ‘Pretty Remarkable’</strong></h2>



<p>What a year for the crypto market.</p>



<p>Few could have foreshadowed that Bitcoin’s parabolic bull run — which began in late 2020 and pulled the entire market up by its bootstraps — would have run out of steam and obliterated practically all of its gains.</p>



<p>Still, in a year that saw an industry-wide liquidity crisis sparked by the implosion of the Terra ecosystem, FTX’s insolvency, and the subsequent contagion, famed fund manager Bill Miller believes bitcoin is holding up well. Miller noted that though the scenario is far from exuberant, with many investors and traders leaving the market, he expected the top cryptocurrency to perform way worse.</p>



<p><em>“I’m surprised Bitcoin isn’t at half of its current price, given the FTX implosion. People have fled the space, so the fact that it’s still hanging in there at $17,000 is pretty remarkable.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>While the present price levels are painfully low compared to the all-time highs about a year ago, it’s still too early to call a long-lasting bearish shift in sentiment, the billionaire investor insinuated. He explained that “inflation is being attacked, and real rates are rising rapidly. I would expect that if and when the Federal Reserve begins to pivot, Bitcoin would do quite well.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of late, the Fed has hiked rates at an unprecedented pace to suppress inflation. With inflation slowing, Fed’s benchmark interest rates will continue to stay elevated for a while but perhaps with less aggressive hikes.</p>



<h2 id="h-miller-endorses-bitcoin-as-digital-gold"><strong>Miller Endorses Bitcoin As Digital Gold</strong></h2>



<p>Bill Miller subscribes to the well-documented paradigm that likens Bitcoin to “digital gold”. Notably, unlike many of his Wall Street contemporaries like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/warren-buffett-says-he-will-never-own-any-cryptocurrency-because-they-have-zero-value/">Warren Buffett</a>, Miller has been a keen investor in the crypto space.</p>



<p>Bitcoin fans say it was created to serve as the ultimate store of value that is not reliant on any centralized power and is efficient thanks to blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Miller also shared his perspective on altcoins, noting that they can be “lumped together in the category of venture speculation”. The billionaire added that most of them will eventually fail before advising investors to allocate at least 1% of their portfolio to bitcoin.</p>

<li>Social media giant Twitter adds price indexes to stocks and other top financial assets.</li>



<li>BTC and ETH make the list of cryptocurrencies added to the search feature; however, DOGE was surprisingly left out.</li>



<li>Crypto enthusiasts laud Elon Musk and his team for the new feature saying digital assets are now getting required recognition.</li>
</ul>



<p>Virtual assets have recorded gains this year in terms of recognition from top companies showing signs of more adoption from the centralized and the corporate world.</p>



<p>Twitter has rolled out a new feature to enable users to view top financial assets&#8217; prices and related data compromising stocks and cryptocurrencies. The new $Cashtags improvement works with users imputing the full name of assets or tickers in the search icon.</p>



<p>While the feature supports a wide range of stocks, it currently has room for only two digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). BTC and ETH are the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and popularity and it is no surprise that they are the first digital assets to be incorporated in the $Cashtags feature.</p>



<p>The feature left out Elon <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-mulls-resigning-as-ceo-of-twitter-whats-next-for-dogecoin/">Musk’s backed Dogecoin</a> (DOGE), which was a huge disappointment to DOGE fans who believed their asset to take the center stage on Twitter activities.</p>



<p>Twitter Business account, which announced the update, later added that the feature which lets users see real-time charts and data will be expanded to improve user experience “<em>in the coming weeks.”</em></p>



<p>Twitter CEO Elon Musk has hailed the announcement, stating it is “<em>one of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>A closer review of the feature shows that variations of ETH and BTC like ‘BTC price’, ‘$Bitcoin price’ and &#8216;$Eth price’ will also pop up the price charts and data.</p>



<p>The charts used in the feature are provided by TradingView and Robinhood in real-time.</p>



<h2 id="h-crypto-has-a-friend-on-twitter"><strong>Crypto has a friend on Twitter</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto users see Twitter as one of their biggest allies, and the reason for this is not far-fetched. Since the Musk acquisition in October, Twitter has become more Twitter-friendly, with users anticipating more crypto-enabled use cases.</p>



<p>This month, Musk gave Twitter users a glimpse of the proposed Twitter 2.0, which among other things, will incorporate cryptocurrency payments to the delight of users. As Twitter continues to be crypto-friendly, rumours have clouded crypto spaces of a “Twitter Coin” to be launched by the platform.</p>



<p>Musk continues to be invested in digital assets, particularly DOGE leading to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-takes-biggest-hit-falls-18-following-elon-musks-twitter-poll/">nosedive</a> the asset faced following the poll results for Musk to step aside as CEO.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/governor-hochul-signs-law-banning-new-proof-of-work-crypto-mining-in-new-york/">crypto mining</a> profitability has been adversely impacted by the challenges facing the crypto industry in 2022. Crypto mining generally refers to the process by which cryptocurrencies generate new coins and verify new transactions onto the blockchain. The blockchain in turn, rewards the miners with new coins for maintaining and securing the blockchain. The reward of new coins incentives miners to dedicate more computing power to secure the blockchain.</p>



<p>Among the factors that impact the profitability of crypto mining is the capital expenditure mainly for the mining equipment, operating expenditure to cover energy and maintenance costs, and the cryptocurrency price. 2022 has by far witnessed declining crypto prices and soaring energy prices, which have adversely affected crypto miners&#8217; profitability.</p>



<p>In September 2022, Compute North, a crypto miner, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of slumping bitcoin crypto prices, rising power costs and the record difficulty in mining bitcoin. Difficulty refers to a measure of how hard it is to mine a block on the network. An algorithm on the Bitcoin network automatically sets the target for the difficulty of mining a new block. A higher difficulty target results in lower profitability of the mining rig.</p>



<p>In a December 12, 2022 press release to the London Stock Exchange, the Bitcoin mining firm Argo Blockchain announced that it was in advanced negotiations with a third party to sell some of its assets and had engaged in an equipment financing transaction to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its liquidity. The company, however, gave no assurance that it could avoid a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Soaring energy prices and the slump in bitcoin prices impacted the company’s operations.</p>



<p>On December 21, 2022, Core Scientific, another large <a href="https://zycrypto.com/are-fears-of-bitcoin-miners-selling-pressure-overblown-this-expert-thinks-so/">Bitcoin miner</a>, filed for bankruptcy in Texas on account of rising energy costs and low bitcoin prices. Core Scientific is also said to have suffered from the bankruptcy of some of its key clients, like the Celsius Network, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. The company plans to keep operations ongoing as it attempts to reach a deal with its lenders and creditors.</p>



<p>Crypto miners have had to search for inexpensive energy sources to maintain the profitability of their mining operations. The high energy prices and low crypto prices seen in 2022 have driven some crypto miners out of business.</p>



<p>Crypto miners need to determine the threshold cryptocurrency price and processing power (hash rate) at which they can profitably mine. In a bear market, crypto miners will seek newer and more energy-efficient models or join mining pools to improve profitability.</p>



<p>Bitcoin continues to trade under $17,000 as of press time, down from around $46,000 at the start of 2022.</p>

<p>Shaktikanta Das, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has made fresh comments against cryptocurrencies. The governor forecasted on Wednesday that the next financial crisis will come from crypto assets if they grow instead of enacting an all-encompassing ban.</p>



<h2 id="h-rbi-governor-on-crypto-causing-next-financial-crisis"><strong>RBI Governor On Crypto Causing Next Financial Crisis</strong></h2>



<p>India’s central bank appears set on its anti-crypto stance.</p>



<p>The Reserve Bank of India’s governor Shaktikanta Das made fresh scathing comments against crypto on December 21 while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO8VEN76L1o&amp;ab_channel=CNBC-TV18">speaking </a>at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit. Das opined that private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum are a financial threat, citing the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX as an example. He thus suggests they shouldn’t be allowed to grow.</p>



<p><em>“Our view is that it should be prohibited because if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow, please mark my words the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies,&#8221; Das stated. &#8220;They have no underlying value. They have huge inherent risks for our macroeconomic and financial stability. I am yet to hear any credible argument about what public good or what public purpose it serves.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The comments from the RBI governor have made it crystal clear that the Indian central bank will maintain its long-standing disapproval of the budding asset class. Since 2013, the apex bank has warned investors against investing in cryptocurrencies through public notices. In 2018, the bank forbade commercial banks from servicing crypto firms, but India’s Supreme Court overturned the ban in March 2020.</p>



<h2><strong>India Pushes Ahead With CBDC</strong></h2>



<p>Das’s remarks come as the Indian Central bank strives to release its central bank digital currency, the digital rupee. Having<a href="https://zycrypto.com/india-will-start-testing-e-rupee-digital-currency-on-november-1/"> tested the wholesale usage of the e-rupee</a> on November 1, the RBI launched a pilot program for the retail CBDC on December 1 with the initial participation of four banks, including the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, and IDFC First Bank.</p>



<p>India is likely feeling the pressure of China’s CBDC rollout, which is gradually extending and has spurred a heated debate among legislators in the United States about whether the sovereignty of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency is at risk.</p>



<p>That said, India’s hostile crypto stance and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heavy-taxation-could-kill-indias-cryptocurrency-market-binance-ceo-warns/">hefty taxes</a> make it difficult for businesses to operate within the world’s second most populous nation. It’s no wonder the country has experienced a crazy brain drain situation in recent years.</p>

<p>The founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-centered-stablecoin-djed-set-to-debut-in-january-ada-poised-for-rapid-adoption/">Cardano</a> has made some notable comments, denoting his thoughts on the Ripple network and its native token, XRP. In a response tweet to being called out for distancing himself from the Ripple community, he set the record straight on his views about Ripple. </p>



<h2 id="h-charles-hoskinson-permanently-cut-ties-with-the-ripple-community"><strong>Charles Hoskinson permanently cut ties with the Ripple community&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><em>“There is no point inviting toxicity into your life. It&#8217;s abusive and pointless. Even in saying it now there are mocking baby memes. Life is too short. Move on and cut it out. XRP provides no partnership or technical value. The community is toxic and petty. I can live without it,”</em> he explained. </p>



<p>Prior to this, Hoskinson had been receiving backlash from the XRP community after what he clarifies was a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; began to spread around.</p>



<p>In a recent Twitter live, he addressed the misinformation, clarifying that he only mentioned that the SEC vs Ripple <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-gleeful-as-rumors-of-secs-lawsuit-against-ripple-wrapping-up-next-week-swirl/">lawsuit might end</a> on the 15th of December because a trustworthy insider source made it known. He added that Cardano and Ripple had built partnerships in the past and that he was always positive to the Ripple community.</p>



<p>He went over the ongoing Ripple case, explaining how he believes that Ethereum might have been given fair treatment from the SEC, but that could also give Ripple the upper hand.</p>



<p>His comment reads ;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“There is no evidence that the SEC was bribed to go after Ripple, the conspiracy there is just senseless, and also if you believe Ethereum got a free pass why is that not good for ripple? because it gives you ammunition in the case to argue that XRP is not a security,&nbsp; based upon the decisions made about Ethereum. It makes no sense to me.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>He maintained that he’d make no comments on Ripple moving forward. He also added that if he were invited to any panel that included a member of the Ripple community, he’d sit it out. He explains that he’s making a choice to steer clear of Ripple in hopes that it resolves the online harassment and misunderstanding from community members.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;It makes no sense to me commenting on that should not make me public enemy number one commenting on things I’ve heard is rumors that I prefaced as rumors and then calling me a liar afterwards is again beyond the pale so no comment moving forward no engagement moving forward.&#8221;</em> He added.</p>

<p>The next chapter in the stunning fall of disgraced FTX ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is about to commence as reports indicate that he is a step closer to returning to American soil to answer to criminal charges after signing the necessary paperwork.</p>



<h2 id="h-update-the-bahamas-to-send-bankman-fried-to-the-u-s-wednesday"><strong>Update: The Bahamas To Send Bankman-Fried To The U.S. Wednesday</strong></h2>



<p>Former CEO of now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, will be extradited to the United States today.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-agrees-extradition-crypto-fraud-case-rcna62513"><em>NBC News</em></a>, Bankman-Fried signed papers on December 20 that began his extradition process. The move was anticipated as he was said to have agreed in principle on Monday to being extradited to the U.S., despite earlier reports claiming he was planning to challenge extradition.</p>



<p>He is set to appear in court on Wednesday morning to continue the extradition process. The Bahamas Department of Correctional Services confirmed the coming departure.</p>



<p><em>“He left from here in good spirits. He was a happy, jolly person,” Doan Cleare, the acting commissioner of corrections at Fox Hill Prison in The Bahamas told The Tribune.</em></p>



<p>Bankman-Fried will be flown to the U.S. the same day on federal aircraft. He is facing a host of charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, in an indictment by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Prosecutors also allege that the crypto mogul misused customer funds and misled investors. If found guilty on all counts, the former FTX executive could spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/">apprehended </a>by Bahamian police a month after FTX’s bankruptcy filing. His request for bail was denied by Bahamas Chief Magistrate JoyAnn Ferguson-Pratt, who believed the former crypto poster child was a flight risk. The New York Post <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/technology/sam-bankman-fried-bail.html">reported </a>that his legal team is in talks with prosecutors to allow him to be released on bail after he is extradited to the U.S.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=774&amp;v=6DezodR9hNI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=TiffanyFong">admitted </a>that he donated to both Democrat and Republican candidates. Notably, the pro-Democratic Senate Majority PAC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/ftx-democrats-senate-majority-pac-to-return-bankman-fried-donations.html">announced </a>yesterday that it&#8217;s looking to return $3 million in donations from the FTX founder. Former Texas Democratic candidate for governor Beto O’Rourke last month returned the $1 million contribution he received from Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace Paxful has removed <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-discloses-three-landmark-opportunities-for-crypto-in-2023/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> from its platform. &#8220;Revenue is nice, but integrity trumps all,&#8221; founder and CEO Ray Youssef said while announcing the shocking delisting. Youssef outlined three main concerns around the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency that led to the decision.</p>



<h2 id="h-bitcoin-as-the-only-honest-money"><strong>Bitcoin As The ‘Only Honest Money’</strong></h2>



<p>On Wednesday, Paxful CEO Ray Youssef shared an <a href="https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1605529289054527488">update </a>that the crypto platform would be suspending trading on ether. ETH trades will be halted on Thursday, which, as noted by Youssef, gives people enough time to end trades and potential disputes.</p>



<p>Youssef highlighted three reasons for the move in a newsletter sent to Paxful customers, noting Paxful’s goal to maintain its integrity and eliminate “economic apartheid”.</p>



<p>Ethereum network’s transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) security model was cited as the first reason for the delisting. Youssef indicated that PoW is arguably the “innovation that makes bitcoin the only honest money there is”. As such, Ethereum’s switch to PoS basically turned it into a “digital form of fiat”.</p>



<p>The Paxful founder further claimed Ethereum is not decentralized as a small bunch of people supposedly controls it “and one day you will need permission to use it”.</p>



<p>Youssef also criticized the blockchain’s ability to allow the tokenization of assets, with the majority ending up being scams and rug pulls. These tokens, Youssef added, “have stolen valuable momentum away from Bitcoin and cost us years on our mission.”</p>



<p>When asked whether Paxful will similarly boot stablecoins from the platform, Youssef <a href="https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1605538950826758146">confirmed</a>, though unenthusiastically, the exchange will not discontinue trades in Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).</p>



<p>Youssef’s ultimate goal is to see “a world where Bitcoin frees billions of people held back by this evil system, especially those unnecessarily harmed living in the Global South.”</p>



<p>The Paxful boss has been an outspoken champion of bitcoin and self-custody following FTX’s implosion last month. He <a href="https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1601934200893997057">advised </a>users never to store their BTC savings on any exchange, Paxful included.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sen. Sherrod Brown wants cryptocurrencies to be banned over illegal activities in the sector.</li>



<li>The Democrat recently introduced a bill to control &#8220;shadow-banking loopholes.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p>Ohio Senator and Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown, has expressed concerns about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, saying the asset class ‘ought to be banned.’ The politician made the comments Sunday while speaking on Meet the Press with NBC’s Chuck Todd.</p>



<p>According to Sen. Brown, D-Ohio, the recent collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire FTX causing investors billions in losses, supports his arguments. Among other disadvantages, Brown cited terrorism financing, human trafficking, and cybercrime &#8211; all of which the committee was educating the public about.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>I have spent much of the last year and a half in this job trying to educate the public about cryptos and the dangers that it presents to our security as a nation and to consumers that get hoodwinked by it</em>,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The Senator – expected to seek his fourth term next year – revealed that his committee had informed the secretary of the Treasury to conduct broader research on cryptos across the various regulatory agencies. Although the SEC has been aggressive, according to the liberal populist, a legislative agenda was necessary to control the digital asset space.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-us-is-keen-to-avoid-making-cryptos-go-offshore"><strong>The US is keen to avoid making cryptos go offshore</strong></h2>



<p>Despite his stance on cryptos, Brown is aware stringent laws could make the asset class go offshore – something industry pundits claim could be behind the recent blowups by major crypto firms. &#8220;<em>At the same time, maybe banning it, although banning it is very difficult because it will go offshore, and who knows how that will work</em>,&#8221; the lawmaker said.</p>



<p>On December 6, Sen. Brown introduced a <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ilc_bill_text.pdf">bill</a> to curb shadow-banking loopholes allowing retail and technology companies to offer banking services without being subjected to the same regulations as traditional financial institutions. The draft came after Twitter CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-rallies-30-on-twitter-payments-anticipation-as-elon-musk-props-up-dogecoin/">announced his plans</a> to introduce payment services on social media.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>To protect consumers’ pocketbooks and ensure a strong banking system for MainStreet, we need to ensure all banking institutions play by the same rules</em>,&#8221; the legislator said. His fellow senators, Chris Van Hollen and Bob Casey, co-sponsored the bill. Other backers included the Independent Community Bankers of America, the Americans for Financial Reform, and the Bank Policy Institute.</p>

<p>The Cardano blockchain gears up to see the launch of one of its most anticipated stablecoin projects, Djed. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, the head of COTI Network, reiterated during an interview that the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-unveils-djed-an-innovative-stablecoin-for-the-fast-growing-ecosystem-issued-by-coti/">algorithm stablecoin</a> would launch on the mainnet in January.</p>



<p>Speaking with popular Cardano-focused podcaster, &#8216;bigpey,&#8217; Shahaf stated:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Next month is our goal to launch the mainnet of Djed and Shen. Right now, you can play with the testnet on Djed.xyz.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Bar-Geffen notes that the launch took this long because developers wanted to ensure that the stablecoin integrates with Cardano&#8217;s Vasil hardfork. Conducting audits also added to the delay of the launch. According to the COTI CEO, developers conducted two rigorous audits to test the security of the stablecoin&#8217;s smart contract.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;One thing we cannot fail on is security. If people are not interested in the product…, I can live with that. I can&#8217;t live with leaving security vulnerabilities in the code without doing everything that we could to make sure that we block all hedges,&#8221; he said.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, he also revealed that COTI and IOG would open-source the highly complicated smart contract that powers the stablecoin shortly after launch. COTI first announced the January launch timeline of Djed during the Cardano Summit back in November.</p>



<h2 id="h-djed-is-already-poised-to-gain-adoption-in-the-cardano-ecosystem"><strong>Djed is already poised to gain adoption in the Cardano ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>The Djed algorithmic stablecoin launch comes with many perks to the Cardano blockchain. Djed boasts of being backed by only cryptocurrencies — including SHEN, its reserve currency, and ADA, the native token of Cardano.</p>



<p>The stablecoin could likely see very rapid adoption due to the fact that it is overcollateralized and has an on-chain proof-of-reserve. COTI already partnered with several Cardano decentralized finance protocols to integrate the stablecoin at launch.</p>



<p>However, this expectation may not play out for several reasons. For one, trust in algorithmic stablecoins has been notably low in the crypto space <a href="https://zycrypto.com/i-bet-big-and-i-think-i-lost-do-kwon-speaks-on-terras-crash/">since the crash</a> of Terra&#8217;s UST and its sister token, LUNA.</p>



<p>Similarly, other stablecoin projects that will compete with Djed are also under development in the Cardano ecosystem. Notably, some of these projects have also run into their own problems.</p>



<p>Last month, Ardana, a company developing a fiat-backed fully reserved stablecoin for the Cardano ecosystem, shut down due to funding problems. Charles Hodkinson, the IOG CEO, commented that it was unfortunate how the project went down. He, however, remains optimistic that more projects will spring up as Cardano grows to become an ecosystem of blockchains.</p>

<p>According to a November 30, 2022 news announcement on its website, Poloniex has entered into a strategic partnership with Huobi that involves working together on ecosystem expansion, project cooperation, liquidity support, and global compliance.</p>



<p>Poloniex is a cryptocurrency exchange and service provider, founded in 2014. Huobi is a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2013 in China and was publicly listed in Hong Kong in 2018.</p>



<p>According to the announcement on Huobi, with effect from December 2022, Huobi will evaluate all projects on Poloniex on a monthly basis with top performing projects standing a chance to be listed directly on Huobi, enjoy full support from Huobi, and get access to users from Huobi. Both parties have stated that going forwards, they will progressively pursue strategic partnerships with other players in the industry.</p>



<p>In a November 30, 2022 blog, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volumes, announced that it had acquired 100% of&nbsp; the Japanese-registered crypto exchange service provider, Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC). This acquisition allows the entry of Binance into the Japanese market as a Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) regulated entity. SEBC offers consultation and brokerage services to its customers.</p>



<p><em>“We are honored and delighted to make this announcement with Binance, one of the world’s leading crypto asset exchange service providers. On top of our effort to prioritize user protection, Binance’s strong compliance system will contribute to building a more compliant atmosphere for users in Japan and help them access key crypto services needed for mass adoption in the future”, said Hitomi Yamamoto, the CEO of SEBC.</em></p>



<p>Crypto.com is an official sponsor of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Through the partnership with FIFA, Crypto.com aims to drive awareness of its trading platform to an estimated global audience of over 5 billion watching the world cup event. Crypto.com, in partnership with Coca-Cola, is also launching a series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to celebrate the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Crypto.com has other sports partnerships in motorsport, basketball, and ice hockey.</p>



<p>Strategic partnerships and acquisitions offer companies the opportunity to attract new customers, to drive innovation&nbsp; and to outperform competitors. Other reasons for strategic partnerships and acquisitions include the ability to expand into new or niche markets, for conducting research aimed at improving existing technologies or for exploring new technologies.</p>



<p>Though the terms of Binance&#8217;s acquisition of SEBC are yet to be fully disclosed, crypto exchanges and companies are seeking strategic partnerships and acquisitions to attract new customers, increase exchange liquidity, expand product offering, to facilitate token listings, and to deal with regulatory barriers.</p>

<p>Crypto’s stretched-out bear market cycle has been attributed to many factors, key among them unfavourable monetary policies by the US Fed, the Russo-Ukrainian war, global pandemics and the FTX debacle.</p>



<p>Notably, fears of a further sell-off being occasioned by BTC miners dumping to avoid losing their hard-earned rewards and support their operations have been rising. However, according to Jaran Mellerud, a Bitcoin mining analyst and consultant, claims about miners dumping and sparking a major BTC sell-off are puffed up.</p>



<p>Today, the pundit explained why BTC miners are unlikely to cause any significant sell-off in the market, noting that such-like claims were “extremely overblown”. While the public image of miners as enormous bitcoin holders and influential market participants might have been accurate in the early years when the block reward was 50BTC, and miners held a higher portion of Bitcoins circulating supply, he noted that “times have changed, and miners no longer hold a meaningful share of the bitcoin supply.”</p>



<p>It is important to note that for miners to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-on-why-bitcoin-price-has-likely-reached-bottom/">influence price</a> significantly, they must collectively own a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. As per data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s circulating supply is 19.2 million BTC. Bitcoin miners are estimated to hold only 1% to 4% of that supply (Roughly 120,000 BTC to 820,000 BTC).</p>



<p>According to Mellerud, <em>“Even if miners sold 300% of their production (2700 BTC daily), it would not amount to more than 0.6% of bitcoin&#8217;s spot volume.”</em></p>



<p>He emphasised that the only worst-case scenario of Miners impacting the spot market was if they dumped their entire holdings once-which again, was “implausible”. Considering miners held 120,000 BTC, if they liquidated all their holdings over 30 days, it would amount to only 1% of the spot volume in an exchange like Binance, which handles an average of 430,000 BTC in daily trading, meaning it would not move markets on a whim.</p>



<p>On the other hand, considering they held 820,000 BTC and sold it all over 30 days, it would be almost 7% of Bitcoin&#8217;s spot volume. The spot market would lack sufficient liquidity to accommodate such large sales, plummeting Bitcoin&#8217;s prices. As ZyCrypto reported, miners sold a maximum of 350% of their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-mining-reserves-plunge-to-12-year-low-heres-what-it-means/">daily production</a> this year, which didn’t even come close to 1% of Bitcoin&#8217;s total spot volume.</p>



<p>The analyst concluded that “<em>Bitcoin&#8217;s spot market has strong liquidity and should be able to accommodate the selling pressure from miners.” </em>Based on his assessment, the selling pressure from miners was thus “<em>overrated and will gradually weaken as the block reward gets smaller”.</em></p>

<p>Beleaguered FTX ex-CEO Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) could be extradited to the United States as early as this week.</p>



<p>According to a New York Times (NYT) report, SBF reportedly told the court in the Bahamas on Monday that he was ready to waive his right to fight extradition to the US, where he faces an array of charges following the collapse of his crypto exchange last month.</p>



<p>The hearing, which took less than an hour, was unexpected, with SBF’s local defence lawyer Jerone Roberts saying that he had not been informed of the hearing. The court reportedly accorded a 15 minutes recess to allow Roberts to confer with SBF over his extradition remarks. The lawyer later told the court that his client wanted to see the indictment against him before agreeing to extradition. However, due to the mix-up, the judge decided to send SBF back to prison pending a proper hearing.</p>



<p>Monday’s session is the latest scene in the high-stakes drama that has been playing out since <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/">SBF was arrested last week</a> following a request by the United States authorities. SBF, 30, is facing over eight charges in the US, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders; conspiracy to commit securities fraud; conspiracy to commit money laundering; and conspiracy to violate the campaign finance.</p>



<p>SBF’s legal team asked the judge to release him on $250,000 cash bail in his first arraignment last week. The team also declared that their client would fight extradition to the United States should it be requested. The court, however, denied their request to have SBF released on bail, with the prosecution labelling him as a flight risk. </p>



<p>Whereas it is unclear what led to SBF’s change of attitude, a source who asked not to be identified noted that it was likely because he would be able to get bail in the US. Some believe that SBF would rather be held in the relatively luxurious US correction facilities than in his current Bahamian corrections department, which is said to be overcrowded and dirty.</p>



<p>Reports circulating in the past week described Fox Hill jail in Nassau-SBF’s current prison-as overcrowded and that he was sharing a small cell with five other individuals. According to a Dec 17 report by the NY Times, a former inmate freed from jail last year described the prison as saying, “It’s no living situation for no type of living being.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The disgraced CEO will also likely receive vegan meals and proper medical care with his apparent deficit disorder (ADD) diagnosis in US facilities, unlike his current facility.</p>
