<p>Polygon Labs has recently announced its vision to build the Value Layer of the internet through the proposed set of upgrades, Polygon 2.0. With the aim to democratize access to the global economy, Polygon 2.0 will enable decentralized finance, digital ownership, and new mechanisms for coordination. The upgrades are set to reimagine almost every aspect of Polygon, ranging from protocol architecture to tokenomics to governance.</p>

<p>The Polygon team plans to detail each component of Polygon 2.0 over the coming weeks through a series of informative blog posts, community meets, and AMAs with the founders and engineers. Polygon 2.0 will become the Value Layer of the internet, offering unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through ZK technology. The network will consist of ZK-powered L2 chains unified via a novel cross-chain coordination protocol, making the entire network feel like using a single chain. Furthermore, cross-chain interactions can happen safely and instantly without additional security or trust assumptions.</p>



<p>Polygon 2.0 aims to expand Ethereum to become what it was always intended to be, a Value Layer that looks and acts like the rest of the internet. This will be achieved by supporting a practically unlimited number of chains while maintaining unified liquidity. Individual blockchains are not infinitely scalable, and adding capacity by creating new chains fragments liquidity and reduces security and capital efficiency.</p>

<p>The team at Polygon Labs plans to delve into topics like the future of the Polygon PoS chain, the utility and evolution of the Polygon token, and the transition to greater community governance of the protocol and treasury over the coming weeks. This will provide the Polygon community with a clear roadmap for how Polygon will become the Value Layer of the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Novatti Group Ltd has added XRP Ledger support for its Australian dollar-backed stablecoin AUDD.</em></li>



<li><em>The stablecoin is intended to be used in applications such as remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and stablecoin-as-a-service.</em></li>



<li><em>Novatti has also recently taken part in a study effort aiming at investigating the applications and advantages of CBDC in Australia.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to an <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/the-next-evolution-in-global-payments-novatti-brings-stablecoins-to-the-australian-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, Novatti Group Ltd, an Australian payments fintech, has extended its Australian dollar-backed stablecoin AUDD to XRP Ledger.</strong></h5>

<p>The AUDD, which was originally published on the Stellar blockchain in November 2022, will be accessible for a direct 1:1 exchange of fiat Australian Dollars through the XRPL. Transactions on the XRPL are both quick (3-5 seconds per transaction) and cheap (fractions of a penny per transaction), making it perfect for the scalability of stablecoins and asset tokenization.</p>



<p>Users may now use AUDD to make payments and trade with other XRPL-based tokens as a result of the extension. Because of the AUDD&#8217;s capabilities on the XRPL, people all over the globe may use it to make payments and trade with other XRP-based tokens through the native decentralized exchange (DEX). According to the company, users will be able to access AUDD using any XRPL-enabled wallet.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Novatti is excited to continue the journey in bringing our stablecoin roadmap to life with the goal to provide faster, more secure payments with lower friction costs to consumers. By deploying AUDD on the XRP Ledger, we will be able to capture the growing demand for digital currencies and create new revenue streams for our business, while delivering on our promise to make our solution available to multiple networks,” Peter Cook, CEO of Novatti Group said in the statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Novatti is incorporating AUDD into its current payment suite. According to the company, the stablecoin is intended to fulfill use cases such as remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and stablecoin-as-a-service.</p>



<p>This latest deployment cements Novatti&#8217;s success in employing the XRPL&#8217;s native digital currency, XRP, for cross-border transactions.</p>

<p>Novatti used Ripple&#8217;s payments solution, which uses XRP as a bridge currency between two fiat currencies, for cross-border remittances between Australia and the Philippines in April 2021.</p>



<p>Novatti&#8217;s involvement in the RBA and Digital Finance CRC&#8217;s CBDC project, which investigates the use cases for a central bank digital currency in Australia, has contributed to the rising momentum of stablecoin adoption.</p>

<p>Novatti has been able to extend its company into 58 countries and handle billions of dollars in yearly transaction value after using <a href="https://news.coincu.com/137073-ripple-gives-fund-to-support-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>&#8216;s payments technology. AUDD is also being incorporated into Novatti&#8217;s current suite of payment products, where it will be used for remittance, payment gateway, trading pair, and Stablecoin-as-a-Service.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/etoro-ending-us-customers-access-to-four-cryptocurrencies/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cryptoslate.com/etoro-ending-us-customers-access-to-four-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlate</a>, stock, and crypto trading platform eToro revealed that it would restrict access to specific cryptocurrencies for users in the United States. Effective from 6:00 a.m. ET on July 12, 2023, users in the U.S. will no longer be able to open new positions in Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Dash (DASH), and Polygon (MATIC), according to a report by CryptoSlate.</p>



<p>eToro clarified that while U.S. customers would be prohibited from initiating new positions in these assets, they would still be allowed to hold and sell any existing positions. This change in policy is solely applicable to U.S. users, with non-U.S. customers remaining unaffected by the decision.</p>



<p>The trading platform attributed its action to evolving regulatory conditions, stating that it had taken this step due to &#8220;recent developments&#8221; in the regulatory landscape. Although the email did not explicitly specify the regulatory concerns, the four affected cryptocurrencies were named in lawsuits filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Coinbase and Binance, starting on June 5.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that eToro, primarily recognized as a trading platform, facilitates the closure of open cryptocurrency positions and allows users to withdraw their balances in either cash or cryptocurrency. This differs from most traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, which focus on direct trading of digital assets.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>FTX&#8217;s creditors&#8217; committee said the Court refused to rescind the automatic asset freeze orders of Bahamas liquidators.</em></li>



<li><em>In its ruling, the Court emphasized that the most important considerations were to maximize capital recovery and return funds to creditors and customers.</em></li>



<li><em>The bankruptcy court also launched a joint motion by the debtor and creditor committee to seal customer data.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX&#8217;s official committee of unsecured creditors tweeted that from June 8 to 9, the bankruptcy court held hearings on two issues in the FTX bankruptcy case: proceedings in the Bahamas and petitions to preserve customer information.</strong></h5>

<p>On June 9, Delaware Judge John Dorsey dismissed the Bahamas Joint Temporary Liquidation Organization (JPL) petition to lift the automatic freeze order. Judge Delaware added that his primary concern is maximizing the value of recovery for FTX&#8217;s creditors and customers worldwide. Bahamian liquidators have received 46 million claims alone, and having similar matters litigated before him and Sir Ian in the Bahamas would inevitably involve increased costs, &#8220;confusion&#8221; and delays with all costs ultimately paid by Cryptocurrency exchange customers crashed.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On Friday, June 9, the Court denied the Bahamian joint provisional liquidators’ (JPLs) motion to lift the automatic stay to raise certain contested issues before the Bahamian court.</p>&mdash; Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of FTX (@FTX_Committee) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTX_Committee/status/1668381133795467264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 12, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For Bahamian liquidators concerned that freezing Chapter 11 would prevent them from performing their legal obligations before the Supreme Court. However, while the ruling appears to be a total loss for the Bahamian liquidation trio, Tribune Business understands they have been greatly encouraged and comforted by various aspects of Judge Dorsey&#8217;s ruling.</p>

<p>Judge Dorsey ruled that serious legal issues needed to be determined before the assets could be distributed and returned to FTX&#8217;s creditors. These include who are clients of FTX Trading and other entities controlled by Mr. Ray and who are clients of FTX Digital Markets in the Bahamas.</p>



<p>The Court also directs the parties to mediate on matters brought up by the joint liquidators. FTX Creditors Committee will participate in mediation and<a href="https://news.coincu.com/193586-ftx-protects-customer-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> protect </a>the interests of creditors and customers. The bankruptcy court also launched a joint motion by the debtor and creditor committee to seal customer data.</p>



<p>In the remaining bankruptcy cases, the names, email addresses, and physical addresses of the natural customers will be permanently deleted. This will protect customers from the risk of scams and other threats. Business customer names, email addresses, and addresses will be deleted within 90 days, possibly with extensions.</p>

<p>The crypto lender hopes to complete the work and tests needed to allow some customers to withdraw funds this summer.</p>



<p>In an email to customers on Monday, BlockFi said: &#8220;At that point, we will be able to begin allowing customers to withdraw digital assets held in non-preferred BlockFi wallet accounts potential funds. Any withdrawals must be made in batches, and eligible individuals will receive an email from the company. Users are advised to set up a third-party wallet for withdrawals.&#8221;</p>



<p>The company said that on June 9, the Supreme Court in Bermuda issued an order allowing the platform to reopen withdrawals for customers with BlockFi Wallet accounts. The platform has also updated the user interface to accurately reflect users&#8217; transactions and account balances as of the platform suspension date of November 10, 2022.</p>

<p>BlockFi has struggled to allow customers to return funds since halting customer withdrawals on November 10 and then filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two weeks later. The crypto lender was forced to suspend withdrawals last year following the collapse of the FTX exchange. It has about 100,000 creditors, assets, and liabilities in the tens of billions of dollars.</p>



<p>According to a BlockFi representative at the time, the company&#8217;s liquidity crisis was caused by loans related to Alameda, an investment fund with the same founder Sam Bankman-Fried as FTX. In addition, most of the platform&#8217;s assets were stuck on the floor when FTX declared bankruptcy, leaving users and partners unable to withdraw their money.</p>

<p>Binance.US, the global Binance exchange, and Changpeng Zhao are being sued by the SEC for securities violations. The suit filed on June 5 alleged &#8220;blatant disregard&#8221; for US securities laws, including mishandling customer funds and misleading regulators and investors. The agency then filed an emergency action application to freeze Binance.US&#8217;s assets to protect customer funds. Binance has disputed these allegations.</p>



<p>In response to the suit, Binance has hired four lawyers from Milbank LLP, including George Canellos, a former co-director of the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division. Canellos previously supervised approximately 1,300 attorneys at the SEC on investigations that included insider trading actions against Raj Rajaratnam and hedge fund managers associated with S.A.C. Capital. Three other attorneys from Milbank are also joining Binance.US&#8217;s defense team.</p>

<p>The former head of SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, John Reed Stark, highlighted the unique skill set of George Canellos, a lawyer hired by Binance.US for its legal defense against the SEC. Canellos has experience serving as both an SEC and DOJ prosecutor, making him a valuable asset to the team.</p>

<p>Binance.US has announced that its banking and payment partners have signaled an intent to pause support for its dollar channels on the platform as early as June 13. This means that it will not be able to process deposits and withdrawals in dollars on the US-focused platform, instead shifting to an all-crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The situation between Binance.US and the SEC is still developing, and it remains to be seen what the outcome of this legal battle will be. However, it is clear that Binance.US is taking this matter seriously and is working to mount a strong defense against the allegations.</p>

<p>The company argues that the move would cripple its business and hurt customers. &#8220;Operations would quickly grind to a halt” without the ability to pay employees, vendors, suppliers, professionals, or to maintain the trading platform, Binance.US attorneys said Monday in a court filing. &#8220;With a freeze of all corporate assets, banking partners would most likely cease to honor requests to transfer funds for any purpose, including customer redemptions.&#8221;</p>



<p>The SEC sought the asset freeze after suing Binance.US, Binance Holdings Ltd., and founder Changpeng Zhao last week, alleging &#8220;blatant disregard of US securities laws&#8221; and &#8220;years of violative conduct&#8221; that put customer funds at risk. Binance.US is also owned by Zhao.</p>

<p>According to the June 5 lawsuit, the violations included mishandling customer funds and misleading investors and regulators. The SEC filed an emergency action application for a temporary restraining order to freeze Binance.US’s assets in an attempt to protect customer funds, including through the repatriation of client investments held abroad. Binance has disputed the allegations.</p>



<p>The case is SEC v. Binance, 23-cv-01599, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington, DC).</p>



<p>The lawsuit has already had an impact on the exchange&#8217;s business, as one of its banking partners has informed Binance.US that it will no longer hold its assets starting on June 14, according to the filing. The same partner froze all activity on the company&#8217;s account until after the court rules on the SEC&#8217;s motion.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Litecoin along with other alts has been under pressure caused by the SEC recently.</em></li>



<li><em>With the much-anticipated halving in August, we will most likely see the $100 price zone.</em></li>



<li><em>LTC is currently still in the safe zone along with BTC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The price of Litecoin (LTC) has been under strong pressure in recent days as investors have focused on the latest SEC litigation against Coinbase and Binance.</strong></h5>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/189309-litecoin-achieves-impressive-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Litecoin</a> is a digital currency intended to facilitate immediate peer-to-peer value exchange at low prices. After Bitcoin, it was one of the first cryptocurrencies to be developed.</p>

<p>This decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, founded by Charlie Lee in 2011, has been a crypto industry stalwart, noted for its speedier block generation times and greater coin supply.</p>



<p>This possible price rise corresponds to the current pattern of greater activity in the Litecoin market. After a 64% price decrease in the first half of 2022, Litecoin has made a stunning rebound, kicking off 2023 strong. Because of its durability and potential for development, Litecoin is a cryptocurrency to keep an eye on in the coming months.</p>



<p>LTC is now trading at $76.4, down from its year-to-date high of $105.65. As of the time of writing, the total circulating supply of Litecoin was 73,130,439 LTC, and the market capitalization of LTC was $5,601,131,992.</p>

<p>While LTC began the month in the red, it quickly rebounded into the green by the end of the month.</p>



<p>Several crypto market observers have raised their price projections for the currency over the next few months, and June might be a month full of green for LTC.</p>



<p>Litecoin, like other cryptocurrencies, is experiencing a period of volatility as investors concentrate on the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit filed last week. According to the complaints, the businesses offered unregulated securities in the United States. The agency also filed a lawsuit against Binance&#8217;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao.</p>



<p>It is simply too early to tell what will happen next in these litigation. As we have seen in the current SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, the procedure may take years. The most probable consequence will be a settlement with the SEC by either Binance or Coinbase. Instead, the two businesses might lose the lawsuit, with serious consequences for the crypto sector.</p>

<p>Popular PoW coins, like as Bitcoin and Litecoin, will be secure since they are regarded as commodities. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate announcement on Wednesday will be the next major driver for the LTC price. Experts predict the bank will keep interest rates steady at 5% to 5.25%.</p>



<p>Litecoin has lately piqued the interest of investors as it prepares for a halving event in August. Historically, incidents that reduced the return for mining Litecoin by half have resulted in huge price gains. Some experts are even anticipating a parabolic increase for Litecoin this summer, which might result in a price explosion.</p>



<p>Also, as the LTC halving approaches, LTC is expected to trade above $100 more regularly. For the following two months, it might average more than $100.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>XRP is well-positioned to survive the impact of the SEC and Binance and enjoy significant increases in the not-too-distant future.</em></li>



<li><em>Tuesday will be a watershed moment for Ripple Labs and the other defendants in the US SEC lawsuit.</em></li>



<li><em>The developments in the Ripple-SEC case have mostly been highly good for Ripple, suggesting that it may experience a favorable outcome.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The crypto world may expect a wild trip on the market charts this week, as much-anticipated vital papers in the Ripple (XRP) case will be disclosed amid the newly filed legal disagreement between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Binance.</strong></h5>

<p>Tuesday will be a watershed moment for <a href="https://news.coincu.com/193519-ripple-faces-the-heat-in-sec-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple Labs</a> and the other defendants in the US SEC lawsuit. In his notorious statement, then SEC Director of Corporate Finance Bill Hinman said that Ethereum (ETH) was not secure. The confidential papers are likely to reveal what internal conversation prompted the executive to propose the nature of Ethereum.</p>



<p>The XRP price has climbed by 1% in the last 24 hours, returning to $0.52 following a weekend in which the departure of Binance&#8217;s market makers led altcoin prices to drop by more than 25%.</p>

<p>XRP exhibited strength in line with predictions that the March litigation between Ripple and the SEC would be resolved by June at the latest, and Ripple&#8217;s odds of winning were strong, but bearish prospects persisted after April and dropped below $0.50.</p>



<p>XRP has already increased by 3.97% in the last week, and the cryptocurrency has increased by more than 50% since the beginning of the year.</p>



<p>Although the SEC&#8217;s efforts against Binance and Coinbase have caused the market to be volatile, XRP is in a better position than most other cryptocurrencies since Ripple&#8217;s own case with the SEC is set to conclude in the coming months.</p>

<p>And if this lawsuit goes well for Ripple, as many analysts believe it will, XRP might skyrocket in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin has remained stable amid a revamped market-wide initiative by the SEC.</em></li>



<li><em>Its price performance has not dampened the enthusiasm of short-term holders.</em></li>



<li><em>$25,400 is Bitcoin&#8217;s key support level.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Despite continuous governmental scrutiny and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding Bitcoin (BTC), the market&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency, the price remains stable.</strong></h5>

<p>During the previous eight weeks, a negative trend formation has pressed cryptocurrency prices, sending total market capitalization to its lowest level in more than two months, at $1.05 trillion.</p>



<p>Short-term investors, who are notorious for being the first to sell their assets when prices fall, have shown exceptional fortitude in the face of the present market turmoil.</p>



<p>These holders are defying the trend by remaining in the market, expressing their belief in Bitcoin&#8217;s future profitability. This time, Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, gained 0.3% in seven days.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The downtrend that began in mid-April has repeatedly challenged the support level, suggesting that an eventual break to the upside will need additional effort from the bulls.</p>



<p>Significantly, the present cycle&#8217;s profitability for both long-term and short-term investors has not yet reached levels that would need major selling pressure. This pattern indicates that Bitcoin still has space for development and the possibility of a new wave of demand.</p>



<p>In separate cases filed last week against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, the Securities and Exchange Commission designated numerous altcoins as securities.</p>



<p>Despite persistent regulatory difficulties and unfavorable market sentiment, short-term investors remain confident in their Bitcoin investments. Moreover, Glassnode data has bolstered the resiliency of short-term investors by demonstrating a recent increase in hodling activity.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-1024x590.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="590" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-1024x590.jpeg" alt="Bitcoin Holds Solid Support $25,400 Despite SEC Suppression" class="wp-image-194485" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-1024x590.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-300x173.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-768x442.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-1536x885.jpeg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-2048x1180.jpeg 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-750x432.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyajEdoXoAMnhgF-1140x657.jpeg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Holds Solid Support $25,400 Despite SEC Suppression 42"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Source: Glassnode</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the statistics, after a month of intense selling, short-term holders have shown a renewed determination to keep their Bitcoin holdings. This change in opinion demonstrates their optimism about Bitcoin&#8217;s future potential, notwithstanding regulatory uncertainty.</p>



<p>Although this consistency is laudable for an asset class that is often volatile, it may come at a cost, particularly if the present support level of $25,400 falls. Maintaining the confluence support would be a difficult effort for the bulls. If this support is gone, investors may begin to prepare for lengthy falls to lower levels such as $24,000, $22,000, and $20,000.</p>



<p>However, long-term Bitcoin holders, in addition to short-term ones, have shown trust in the cryptocurrency. Some holders have moved their tokens to centralized exchanges with little fluctuation, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining their Bitcoin holdings for the long run.</p>
