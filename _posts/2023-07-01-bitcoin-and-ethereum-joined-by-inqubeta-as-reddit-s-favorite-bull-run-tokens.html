<p>InQubeta (QUBE) has joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on Reddit&rsquo;s list of tokens selected to enjoy bull runs in 2023. Ethereum has had the most substantial price growth in 2023 with its prices rising by over 60%. Bitcoin lagged behind Ethereum, despite having the larger market capitalization, with its prices only growing by about 40% at the height of its bull run.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets have been generally bearish since the two most popular tokens&rsquo; price growth earlier in the year, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped InQubeta&rsquo;s presale from exceeding all expectations. Tokens allocated for the presale&rsquo;s beta stage were sold out before the period ended. Investors standing to increase the value of their investments by 400% thanks to incremental price changes at each of the presale's ten stages is one of the best deals in the cryptocurrency world.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE) making waves with Reddit investors
<p>Reddit investors know a thing about bull runs so it&rsquo;s prudent to consider which cryptocurrencies or other investment opportunities are popular on the forum. Redditors wreaked havoc on Wall Street whales a few years ago when the forum backed stocks like GameStop and AMC, squeezing hedge funds that were shorting them.</p>
<p>The Reddit mania led to $24 billion being traded on U.S. stock exchanges on Jan 27, 2021, exceeding the previous high of $8 billion set during the 2008 financial crisis. GameStop stock prices went skyrocketing, forcing investors shorting the stock to purchase some to minimize their losses, driving prices further up.</p>
<p>InQubeta is the latest cryptocurrency project to gain the attention of Redditors as its platform makes investments in artificial intelligence more accessible for everyday people. It&rsquo;s not surprising to see Reddit investors, many of whom view themselves as the little people sticking it to the big whales, embrace a democratic platform that empowers everyday people who might not meet the elitist standards of traditional investment channels, like minimum investments that surpass the average annual income in the U.S.</p>
The InQubeta way
<p>InQubeta makes becoming part-owner of an artificial intelligence startup as easy as buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the ecosystem&rsquo;s marketplace. Startups looking for capital make these equity-based NFTs on InQubeta&rsquo;s Ethereum-based blockchain and investors purchase them with $QUBE tokens.</p>
<p>The NFTs are sent to investors after sales are finalized and they&rsquo;re free to sell or hold on to them at any point. These NFTs work like stocks, and some come with extra rewards like a slice of the startup&rsquo;s profits.</p>
<p>Thanks to InQubeta, investing in what many are already calling the biggest tech revolution in human history is now more accessible than ever. The internet was the last significant tech breakthrough and it created many millionaires and billionaires. For instance, $2,000 invested in Netflix in the early 2000s would be worth over a million dollars today. InQubeta&rsquo;s approach to investing now makes similar investment opportunities available to all.</p>
<p></p>
Bitcoin (BTC) is almost halfway back to pre-2022 prices
<p>Bitcoin continues to enjoy the largest market capitalization in the cryptocurrency space and it&rsquo;s already enjoyed some decent growth in 2023. Many cryptocurrency experts are expecting a bigger bull run later in the year.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) growing faster than Bitcoin
<p>Ethereum has seen more price increases in 2023 than Bitcoin due to various reasons like Ethereum-based altcoins like InQubeta and Polygon (MATIC) making waves in mainstream and crypto investment circles. Ethereum will likely continue outpacing Bitcoin for the remainder of the year but don&rsquo;t expect it to keep up with InQubeta.</p>
Summary
<p>InQubeta has an excellent chance of seeing more growth than more popular coins like BTC and ETH thanks to incremental price changes during its presale and its tokens being undervalued. Investors can expect to increase the value of their portfolios by up to 400% during the presale period, and there are no limits for InQubeta prices from that point.</p>
