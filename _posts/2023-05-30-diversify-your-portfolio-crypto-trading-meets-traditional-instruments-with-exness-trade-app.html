<p>At some point in every trader&rsquo;s journey, the concept of portfolio diversification becomes a mainstay. It&rsquo;s a mandatory lesson for life if you&rsquo;re interested in having the best shot at success and having that elusive result only a small portion of traders end up having &ndash; more profits than losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world of high inflation, increasing interest rates and strained geopolitical tension, opening positions across a variety of different asset classes is more important than ever. The Exness Trade App makes this task seamless and convenient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a one-stop-shop platform, the app offers the entire A-Z trading journey, from sign-up to withdrawal. More importantly, it offers a diverse range of instruments, including a bountiful selection of cryptocurrency CFDs alongside the more traditional markets. Unlike some other trading apps on the market, Exness Trade provides a comprehensive trading experience for anyone looking to put their eggs in as many baskets as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why having the crypto trading option matters&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exness opens the door to the next level of portfolio diversification &ndash; the ability to spread your capital across a very wide range of crypto prices against the USD, Gold, the Aussie Dollar, and more. Exness Trade App gives access to all of the broker&rsquo;s cryptocurrency products through its MT5 trading accounts. That means you can trade the price of 25+ crypto CFDs on offer against the US Dollar &ndash; from the biggest market players in Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum to the lesser-known 1inch, Polkadot, and Elon Musk&rsquo;s favorite Dogecoin. Exness is also one of the very few brokers who offer you the opportunity to trade Bitcoin&rsquo;s price against metals like Gold and Silver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond having access to such an impressive portfolio of cryptos, trading with Exness Trade App comes with a whole slew of features that can propel your crypto trading to new heights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Features for an immersive crypto trading experience</p>
<p>What makes the Exness Trade App really stand out is the way it allows users to monitor and analyze their trading performance, as well as its customization capabilities. Since there is such a large collection of cryptocurrencies on offer, you have options to tailor your app experience so that you keep quick track of the cryptos you care about.</p>
<p>For example, in the Performance section, you can analyze your overall trading history for instruments like BTCXAU, BTCUSD, DOTUSD, DOGEUSD, and ETHUSD in terms of profit and loss by looking at different time periods and time categories. Four different time periods &ndash; 7, 30, 90, or 365 days &ndash; and three different time categories &ndash; General period, Time intervals, or Data slices &ndash; help you perform a deep dive into your profitable and non-profitable historical crypto orders.</p>
<p>Sifting through all the instruments in the app is made much easier by the three different ways you can view them:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Favorites &ndash; you can tag any crypto instrument you&rsquo;d like as a favorite, such as BTCXAU, DOTUSD, or DOGEUSD, and it will be grouped here.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Popular &ndash; a category that is automatically updated based on the overall number of orders from all Exness traders. See how popular crypto trading is with other traders and adjust your strategy accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Top movers &ndash; a list that is refreshed every time the app is loaded, featuring 10 instruments with the highest percentage of daily price changes (top five bullish and top five bearish). Keep an eye out for any big movers in the crypto market here.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ultimate personalized experience, crypto traders can set up personalized push notifications on the Exness Trade App, as well as bid and ask price alerts, for specific cryptocurrency CFD instruments or events. Multiple alerts can be set up for a single instrument, such as BTCUSD or ETHUSD, and the app stores a history of your alerts until you decide to clear it. This way, you&rsquo;ll never miss a minute of the crypto market action that you care about the most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond these stand-out features, the Exness Trade App also offers more standard, but extremely useful, tools to help you navigate the crypto markets. Things like margin, swap, and spread calculators, economic calendars, trading signals, and the latest news help you hone your trading strategies, while different chart layouts, popular indicators, and the ease of setting up take profit and stop loss orders help to sharpen the technical side of your trades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trading the more traditional markets for next-level diversification</p>
<p>Besides cryptocurrency CFDs, the Exness Trade App also caters to traders interested in more traditional markets, or those looking to diversify their portfolio beyond just crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can access a vast array of CFDs in forex, metals, indices, energies, and stocks. Metals, for example, include a range from the most popular Gold vs. USD (XAUUSDm) with an extended swap-free option, to the rare Palladium (XPDUSDm) that you won&rsquo;t find with many other brokers. This kind of versatility applies to all the other asset classes, allowing traders to capitalize on a multitude of opportunities across different market sectors and adapt their strategies according to changing market conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exness has built an app that ensures a comprehensive trading experience, whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned crypto trader, a beginning trader, or anyone in between.</p>
