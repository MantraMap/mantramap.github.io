The indicted crypto mogul also argued that revoking his bond would violate his right to free speech. </strong></p>
<h2>Bankman-Fried Says He Never Tried to Intimidate Witnesses Ahead of Trial</h2>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former chief executive of failed crypto exchange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>, claims he has never attempted to intimidate witnesses in his trial set to begin in October. In a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan, quoted by Reuters and Bloomberg, he insisted there was no reason for him to go to jail as requested by the prosecution.</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. prosecutors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prosecutors-want-sam-bankman-fried-jailed-ahead-of-trial/">asked</a> Kaplan to jail SBF after an article published by the New York Times quoted excerpts from a diary written by Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund Alameda Research and his former girlfriend. They accused him of trying to intimidate Ellison, who pleaded guilty and may testify against him.</p>
<p>Judge Kaplan imposed a temporary gag order and gave both sides time to prepare and submit written arguments before he rules on the request. In the letter, SBF’s lawyer Mark Cohen stated that the interview “was a proper exercise of his rights to make fair comment on an article already in progress, for which the reporter already had alternate sources.” He also stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried’s contact with the New York Times reporter was not an attempt to intimidate Ms. Ellison or taint the jury pool.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bahamas-headquartered FTX, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges before it collapsed last year, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in November. Bankman-Fried was arrested in December in the Bahamian capital, Nassau, and extradited to the United States to face fraud charges, including misuse of customer funds, some of which were allegedly transferred to Alameda.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty and has been living under house arrest at his parent’s home in California on a $250 million bond. He has frequently communicated with the public and the media since his arrest, having made 100 calls with the New York Times reporter alone, according to U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>SBF’s lawyers claim that jailing him would raise First Amendment issues. “As the government concedes, criminal defendants have a right to talk to the press about their case to influence their public image and try to protect their reputation, as long as the communications are not calculated to pervert the course of justice,” the letter notes. The defense also argued that restricted internet access at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where SBF would be held, would prevent him from preparing for the trial.</p>

The professional services entity highlights four carbon-reduction techniques adopted by bitcoin mining firms across the entire mining sector. </strong></p>
<h2>KPMG Report Discusses Bitcoin and ESG Standards</h2>
<p>KPMG&#x2019;s <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/2023/bitcoins-role-esg-imperative.pdf">analysis</a> describes how <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> miners, seeking proximity to inexpensive renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, reduce costs. This practice creates additional revenue to support more renewable energy projects in remote areas. The flexible computing load of bitcoin can also assist in balancing electrical grids by cutting demand during peak periods. KPMG researchers detail how bitcoin miners used a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/analyst-says-duke-energy-corporation-is-studying-bitcoin-mining-applied-to-demand-response/">demand response</a> system to aid Texas during a winter storm in 2021. The report states:</p>
<blockquote><p>During Winter Storm Uri, which took place in Texas in February 2021, and saw temperatures get down as low as -14 degrees, bitcoin miners in Texas were able to curtail their energy consumption which resulted in approximately 1,500 megawatts being given back to the grid.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study emphasizes that some miners are now recycling the intense heat <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/innovative-heating-solutions-bitcoin-miners-turning-heat-into-satoshis/">generated</a> by specialized bitcoin mining rigs to warm homes, buildings, and greenhouses. This process turns wasted heat into beneficial thermal energy, replacing more carbon-intensive heating fuels. Additionally, KPMG highlights ventures such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gas-to-bitcoin-mining-firm-crusoe-energy-systems-raises-505-million/">Crusoe Energy</a>, which captures flared natural gas from oil fields to power modular bitcoin mining data centers. This practice reduces the emission of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas. Other startups are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/landfill-gas-mitigation-firm-vespene-energy-gas-to-bitcoin-solutions/">mining bitcoin at landfills</a>, converting the released methane into valuable electricity.</p>

<p>KPMG estimates that flared gas emissions from U.S. and Canadian oil production alone could sustain the entire bitcoin network. With landfills accounting for more than 14% of U.S. methane emissions, utilizing this waste methane for mining could significantly reduce the world&#x2019;s carbon footprint.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>To capitalize on these emissions-reducing strategies, KPMG recommends that bitcoin mining companies actively work with renewable energy developers, grid operators, gas producers, and landfill managers. Joining industry groups that promote energy and materials stewardship practices can also aid miners in adopting cleaner technologies. While bitcoin mining&#x2019;s significant energy consumption often sparks environmental worries, KPMG contends that carefully locating facilities near energy waste streams and engaging in participatory grid management can counterbalance related emissions.</p>
<p>With proactive partnerships and innovation, KPMG&#x2019;s report underscores that bitcoin mining could contribute significantly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality">&#x201C;Net Zero&#x201D; or &#x201C;Carbon Neutrality&#x201D;</a> ambitions. However, KPMG observes that realizing bitcoin&#x2019;s potential for reducing carbon emissions necessitates mining companies taking responsibility for their effects. Openly disclosing energy sourcing, emissions profiles, and sustainability strategies will further foster confidence in the bitcoin ecosystem&#x2019;s dedication to minimizing the world&#x2019;s carbon footprints.</p>

Biden officials call the downgrade decision “bizarre and baseless.” Both the White House and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen strongly disagreed with the downgrade decision. Yellen claimed that the change by Fitch Ratings “is arbitrary and based on outdated data.”</strong></p>
<h2>Fitch Downgrades US Rating</h2>
<p>Fitch Ratings, one of the three largest credit rating agencies in the U.S., downgraded the United States&#8217; long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+ on Tuesday. The rating agency <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-united-states-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa-outlook-stable-01-08-2023">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rating downgrade of the United States reflects the expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also reflects “a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to &#8216;AA&#8217; and &#8216;AAA&#8217; rated peers over the last two decades that has manifested in repeated debt limit standoffs and last-minute resolutions,” Fitch added.</p>
<p>“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” the rating agency detailed. Moreover, Fitch explained that in its view, “there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025.”</p>
<p>In addition, Fitch described:</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect the general government (GG) deficit to rise to 6.3% of GDP in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022, reflecting cyclically weaker federal revenues, new spending initiatives and a higher interest burden.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rating agency placed the country’s credit rating on negative watch in May, citing the debt ceiling fight in Washington. Despite the U.S. successfully avoiding default on its debt obligations in June, Fitch maintained the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fitch-maintains-negative-watch-on-us-rating-despite-debt-limit-resolution/">negative watch</a>. However, in its announcement on Tuesday, Fitch clarified that the negative watch on the U.S. has been removed, and a &#8220;stable outlook&#8221; has been assigned.</p>

<h2>White House, Biden Officials, and Yellen Disagree</h2>
<p>Following the rating downgrade, officials from the Biden administration told journalists that the governance issues highlighted by Fitch occurred during former President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration. Noting that Fitch had maintained a AAA rating during that period, a senior Biden official said: &#8220;This is a bizarre and baseless decision for Fitch to make now &#8230; It simply defies common sense to take this downgrade as a result of what was really a mess caused by the last administration and reckless actions by congressional Republicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House also released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/01/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-the-recent-decision-by-fitch-ratings/">statement</a> following Fitch&#8217;s decision. &#8220;We strongly disagree with this decision,&#8221; White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. &#8220;The ratings model used by Fitch declined under President Trump and then improved under President Biden, and it defies reality to downgrade the United States at a moment when President Biden has delivered the strongest recovery of any major economy in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also released a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1665">statement</a> regarding the downgrade. She stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I strongly disagree with Fitch Ratings’ decision. The change by Fitch Ratings announced today is arbitrary and based on outdated data.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Fitch’s quantitative ratings model declined markedly between 2018 and 2020 — and yet Fitch is announcing its change now, despite the progress that we see in many of the indicators that Fitch relies on for its decision,&#8221; Yellen explained. &#8220;Many of these measures, including those related to governance, have shown improvement over the course of this administration, with the passage of bipartisan legislation to address the debt limit, invest in infrastructure, and make other investments in America’s competitiveness.&#8221;</p>

<h2>U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Odds Rise to 65%, Analysts Cite Blackrock Influence</h2>
<p>Following a wave of spot bitcoin ETF filings and revisions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now finds itself with several applications awaiting review. In the midst of June, Blackrock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager by assets under management (AUM), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">lodged</a> its spot bitcoin ETF application, with several other contenders quickly falling in line. Fast forward to August 2, 2023, and Bloomberg ETF analysts <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff">James Seyffart</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas">Eric Balchunas</a> publicly offered their insights regarding the SEC&#8217;s potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>“Based on recent events and new information Eric Balchunas and I are officially increasing our spot bitcoin ETF approval odds to 65%. That&#8217;s from 50% a couple of weeks ago and 1% a few months ago,” Seyffart <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1686707919696568320?s=20">posted</a> on the social media platform X. Seyffart’s post also shares a statement from both analysts which states:</p>
<p>&#8220;The odds of a spot bitcoin ETF launching this year are up to 65%, in our eyes, after a flurry of developments: Gary Gensler downplaying his role at the SEC, the commission&#8217;s tacit approval of Coinbase&#8217;s Bitcoin exchange, Grayscale&#8217;s attempt to minimize other filings and the SEC&#8217;s loss in front of the same judges in the Grayscale case. Finally, pressure from Blackrock and possibly Democrats could make denying the ETFs politically untenable for Gensler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seyffart <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1686709254185463808?s=20">emphasizes</a> that his team is speculating on the timing of the Grayscale case dates, but asserts that they envision the easiest path as simultaneous approval for all eight filers plus Grayscale, following the courts&#8217; overturning of the SEC&#8217;s denial. &#8220;The lynchpin&#8221; for this, Seyffart argues, is a triumph by Grayscale over the SEC in federal court. It could pave the way for a surge of SEC approvals sometime in the fourth quarter. However, that &#8220;all depends on how much Gensler wants to fight here,&#8221; Seyffart explains.</p>

Two-week statistics show HEX has lost 41.7% against the U.S. dollar and 35.8% over the past seven days.</strong></p>
<h2>Uniswap Delists HEX Following SEC Lawsuit; HEX Loses Over 40%</h2>
<p>In the past two weeks, HEX has shed more than 40% against the greenback, and on Aug. 2, 2023, the price is down around 2%. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-files-lawsuit-against-richard-heart-and-companies-hex-pulsechain-and-pulsex/">filed a lawsuit</a> against the creator of the Hex blockchain, Richard Schueler, also known as Richard Heart, and his companies Pulsechain and Pulsex.</p>

<p>The SEC complaint accuses Heart of offering and selling unregistered crypto tokens and defrauding investors by misappropriating funds. Two days after the SEC complaint was filed, the largest decentralized exchange, or dex, by trade volume, Uniswap, delisted HEX from the dex interface.</p>
<p>According to metrics, there&#x2019;s a circulating supply of 173,411,074,413 HEX based on the ERC20 standard; there&#x2019;s also a total supply of 581,233,513,031 HEX. Approximately <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/hex/richlist/">60.89%</a> of the circulating supply is held by the top 10 wallets among the 330,072 unique Ethereum addresses that hold HEX.</p>

<p>The top 100 addresses command 63.15% of the supply. On centralized exchanges that list HEX, the token has seen $5,183,908 in 24-hour global trade volume. This includes exchanges like Mexc, Bitget, Poloniex, Bitrue and Yobit, according to coingecko.com statistics.</p>

<p>PLS, the native asset for Pulsechain, on the other hand, is up 25% over the past day, but during the last seven days, it shed 42.3% against the U.S. dollar. In the past two weeks, PLS shed 46.9%. PLS has recorded around $2.1 million in global trade volume over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Pulsechain block explorer claims the network has 70,752,114 unique addresses. Both HEX and PLS have been added to the alleged SEC securities crypto token market cap, which holds a value of around $84.9 billion on Aug. 2, with coins including <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, SOL and many others.</p>

<h2>Gamestop to Discontinue iOS and Chrome Extension Wallets: Regulatory Challenges Cited</h2>
<p>Visitors to Gamestop&#8217;s online crypto hub, &#8220;<a href="https://nft.gamestop.com/">nft.gamestop.com</a>,&#8221; are now met with an announcement declaring the removal of the firm&#8217;s Web3 wallet. &#8220;Due to the regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space, Gamestop has decided to remove its iOS and Chrome Extension wallets from the market on November 1, 2023,” the statement from Gamestop explains.</p>

<p>The company first <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gamestop-nft-website-discovered-with-hidden-easter-egg-retro-game/">signaled</a> its interest in the non-fungible token (NFT) and Web3 domain in May 2021. A year later, in May 2022, Gamestop <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gamestop-launches-web3-ethereum-wallet-that-leverages-looprings-zk-rollup-tech/">launched</a> the firm&#8217;s Ethereum-based wallet, employing Loopring&#8217;s zk-rollup technology. In November 2022, several months later, the Gamestop NFT Marketplace was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gamestop-nft-marketplace-is-now-live-on-immutable-x-market-features-web3-games/">launched</a> on Immutable X, showcasing Web3 games and NFTs.</p>
<p>Gamestop remained vague about the specific regulations prompting the halt of its Web3 wallet venture, but 2023 has marked a year of substantial regulatory enforcement, especially in the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has categorized dozens of crypto assets as securities and maintains that some exchanges are conducting unregistered brokerage services.</p>

<p>This regulatory atmosphere has motivated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">Robinhood</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etoro-to-delist-algo-mana-dash-and-matic-for-us-customers-amid-evolving-regulatory-landscape/">Etoro</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bakkt-takes-proactive-measures-delists-polygon-solana-and-cardano-amid-regulatory-crackdowns/">Bakkt</a> to remove several crypto assets from their platforms. The Gamestop Wallet is a self-custodial wallet and the web portal’s announcement notes that people can leverage their secret passphrase to recover their accounts.</p>
<p>“We advise that all customers ensure that they have access to their secret passphrase by October 1, 2023,” Gamestop disclosed. “Any customer with access to their secret passphrase has the ability to recover their account in any compatible wallet.”</p>

<h2>Halving Unshaken: Litecoin Network Sees Third Reduction in Rewards</h2>
<p>On August 2, 2023, the Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) blockchain documented its third block reward halving. Litecoin&#x2019;s first halving transpired on August 25, 2015, at block height 840,000, and the second occurred on August 5, 2019, at block height 1,680,000.</p>
<p>The most recent reward halving, happening at block height 2,520,000, has reduced the reward from 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> to 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>. Prior to this halving event, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> miners generated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230731032236/https://www.litecoinblockhalf.com/">7,200 new LTC units</a> each day; that rate has now fallen to <a href="https://www.litecoinblockhalf.com">3,600</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-600821" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37.png" alt="" width="1554" height="1158" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37-300x224.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37-1024x763.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37-768x572.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37-1536x1145.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37.png 1554w" sizes="(max-width: 1554px) 100vw, 1554px"></p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> prices have decreased by over 4%, but they remained stable with a minor 0.2% increase throughout the previous week. At that point in time, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> miners received roughly $656,919 daily in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> rewards; this figure has now been cut to $331,946.</p>
<p>The data undeniably demonstrates that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> miners faced a considerable loss in revenue following the automated halving completion. Litecoin&#x2019;s annual inflation rate has plunged from 3.64% to the present figure of 1.80%; by the next halving event, it is expected to decline further to 0.84%.</p>
<p>Litecoin&#x2019;s current annual inflation rate is marginally higher than Bitcoin&#x2019;s rate of 1.70%. However, Bitcoin&#x2019;s inflation rate will alter in just 268 days during its upcoming halving event; Litecoin must wait for another&#x200B; &#x200B;1,458 days until its subsequent halving.</p>
<p>Following Bitcoin&#x2019;s halving, scheduled for on or around April 26, 2024, the yearly inflation rate will descend to 0.84%. At present, Litecoin&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart">total hashrate</a> remains relatively consistent, cruising at 834.16 terahash per second (TH/s).</p>
<p>Approaching the Litecoin halving, the hashrate surged two months earlier, culminating in an all-time peak of 1.03 petahash per second (PH/s) on July 4, 2023, at block height 2,503,485. This security of hashrate persists post-halving; only time will reveal if reduced revenue compels the hashrate to depart.</p>

The wider market cap was mostly higher in today’s session, led by the optimism surrounding Microstrategy’s latest bitcoin investment. Chainlink also jumped higher after recent losses. </strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) bounced back higher during Wednesday’s session, as the token moved away from a recent four-week low.</p>
<p>After plunging to a bottom $0.6751 on Tuesday, MATIC/USD rallied to a peak of $0.7022 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move came as bulls rejected a breakout below a recent price floor of $0.6750, which coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) pushing away from its own support level.</p>

<p>After racing from the aforementioned point at 43.00, the index made an attempt to reach resistance of 45.00.</p>
<p>However, at the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 44.06, with MATIC back below $0.7000.</p>
<p>Overall, momentum appears to be bearish, with the token falling for five of the last seven sessions.</p>

<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>In addition to polygon, chainlink (LINK) rebounded from a recent losing streak which resulted in price hitting a one-week low.</p>
<p>LINK/USD leaped to an intraday high of $7.70 during today’s session, following a drop to a low of $7.40 the day prior.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s decline pushed chainlink below a support point of $7.50, and to its weakest level since July 26.</p>

<p>LINK has managed to recover from its earlier drop, as the RSI climbed away from its own floor at the 55.00 zone.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 56.78, and appears to be making a move towards a ceiling of 60.00.</p>
<p>In the event that this level is hit, there is a good chance that LINK moves above $7.80.</p>

Then, on Tuesday, the Japanese yen plummeted to its weakest position against the greenback in over 20 years, a shift that came after the Bank of Japan opted to keep its extremely loose monetary policy unchanged, despite the mounting pressures of inflation and a depreciating currency.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Yen&#8217;s Steepest Dive in 20 Years as BOJ Stands Firm on Loose Monetary Strategy</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The yen weakened past 143 to the dollar on Tuesday, down more than 5 yen from Friday when the Bank of Japan (BOJ) <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Currencies/Yen-falls-to-one-month-low-of-143-per-dollar-after-last-week-s-BOJ-move">announced</a> it would allow long-term yields to rise to 1% from 0.5%. The BOJ kept its key interest rate at -0.1% and said the 1% cap on 10-year bond yields was not a fixed target but a loose guideline.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Economists had <a href="https://www.nri.com/en/knowledge/blog/lst/2023/fis/kiuchi/0213_2">speculated</a> the BOJ would start normalizing policy to combat rising prices, but it cited wage-driven rather than cost-push inflation as the key factor in any changes. This <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/japanese-yen-depreciated-after-the-bank-of-japan-meeting-outcome-202308010926">disappointed</a> currency traders who sold the yen aggressively, reversing an initial 2% gain Friday.</p>

<p dir="ltr">BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-28/ueda-says-boj-policy-justified-by-weak-core-inflation-below-2">suggested</a> that it&#8217;s possible to start normalizing monetary policy if the BOJ becomes confident that inflation will pick up next year. However, Ueda also mentioned that for now, underlying inflation remains below 2% and the BOJ&#8217;s outlook is for price increases to slow toward the end of the year.</p>

As carry trades unwind, dollars are repaid and the yen strengthens. Six-month statistics against the U.S. dollar show the yen is up more than 11%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;All these markets are linked together in terms of global liquidity flows. People borrow in yen to buy dollars, dollars sit around looking for something to do, people say we might buy Treasuries or Apple,&#8221; the global equities fund manager at Artemis, Simon Edelsten, told Reuters on July 27.</p>

<p>At the moment current bond market volatility suggests yields will remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 0.6%, up just 0.15 points since Thursday. Markets expect further BOJ intervention if yields spike too fast. The Federal Reserve has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fed-forex-swaps-cenbanks/ny-fed-fx-swaps-with-foreign-central-banks-total-3-07-billion-in-latest-week-idUSKBN19R2WL">supported measures</a> to provide U.S. dollars to Japan in a crisis after setting up swap lines last year. But uncertainty reigns over whether dollar strength or yen weakness will dominate.</p>
