			            <description><![CDATA[The first-ever insider trading case involving cryptocurrencies comes to a close. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Tuesday that ex-Coinbase manager Ishan Wahi and his brother, Nikhil Wahi, agreed to settle charges for insider trading using knowledge from the exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The former has been forced to forfeit 10.97 ETH ($20,848.92) and 9,440 USDT, while the latter was made to forfeit $$892,500.</span></p>
<h2>The End of Crypto’s First Insider Trading Case</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the SEC’s </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-98" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the brothers’ fines represent penalties for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from their trading scheme, plus prejudgment interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The brothers – in addition to one of their friends, Sameer Ramani – were charged by the Department of Justice in July 2021 in the first-ever insider trading case involving cryptocurrencies. Specifically, Ishan Wahi was accused of tipping his brother and friend with information about coins that would soon be listed at Coinbase, who would buy them in advance of public listing announcements. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coinbase treated such information as confidential and warned its employees not to trade on the basis of, or tip others with, that information,” explained the SEC.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/analysis-a-binance-listing-adds-41-on-crypto-prices-2f6cd72e8dff#:~:text=In%20most%20cases%2C%20a%20Binance,varies%20from%20project%20to%20project." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> has shown that public listings at popular exchanges have a largely appreciative impact on a coin’s price. Indeed, the co-conspirators were alleged by prosecutors to have profited $1.5 million across 55 different token trades between June 2021 and April 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though Ishan Wahi initially </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ex-coinbase-executive-pleads-not-guilty-to-insider-trading-case-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">fought</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> allegations against him, he ultimately </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-coinbase-exec-pleads-guilty-to-insider-trading-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">pled guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in February. His brother already did the same in September, </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-execs-brother-pleads-guilty-to-cryptocurrency-wire-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">lamenting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that his crime was “something that I will have to live with forever.”</span></p>
<h2>Punishment From the SEC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both brothers agreed not to deny the SEC’s allegations as part of the settlement deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though Nikhil paid the larger fine, he will only spend </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/brother-of-former-coinbase-manager-sentenced-to-10-months-in-prison/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">10 months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> behind bars, as opposed to his brother’s </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fired-coinbase-exec-caught-with-insider-trading-sentenced-to-2-years-in-prison/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">2-year prison sentence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The SEC said that at least nine of the assets purchased by the group “were securities,” defying claims by Coinbase that the exchange doesn’t list any securities. Ishan Wahi’s lawyers </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/lawyers-challenge-secs-attempt-at-labelling-9-tokens-as-securities/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">challenged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> these claims in February, and Coinbase continues to spat with the agency regarding legal classifications for crypto as a whole </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The federal securities laws do not exempt crypto asset securities from the prohibition against insider trading, nor does the SEC,”  said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, in the agency’s statement. “I am grateful to the SEC staff for successfully working to resolve this matter.”</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[The BTC discount on Binance Australia could be attributed to traders trying to exit their positions before the June 1 withdrawal deadline. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the prices of bitcoin and other crypto assets were seen trading at a discount on the Australian arm of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, compared to rival local platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 1:10 pm, bitcoin (BTC) was trading at A$34,863 ($22,670) on </span><a href="https://www.binance.com/en-AU/crypto" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Australia,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about A$7,516 ($4,913) lower than the average price on most exchanges, including </span><a href="https://www.btcmarkets.net/prices?show=lastPrice,pricePct24h,volumeQte24h,volume24h,chart" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BTC Markets,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where it was trading at A$43,000 ($28,130), Coinjar and Independent Reserve. Other assets like Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also traded at about 20% discounts.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Trades at a Discount in Binance Australia</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discounts on crypto prices on Aussie exchanges could be attributed to users trying to exit their positions quickly to avoid being cut off from a local withdrawal route scheduled to cease soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Binance Australia </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1659018600496373760?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">informed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its users that they would be unable to withdraw fiat to their bank accounts using the Australian PayID service, a popular payment method, from 5 pm on June 1, 2023. The exchange said the halt was due to a decision made by its third-party payment service provider and that it was searching for an alternative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the same day of the announcement, Australian big four bank Westpac </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-australia-banned-by-big-four-bank-westpac-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its customers from transacting with all crypto exchanges, including Binance Australia. Westpac revealed that the ban is part of a trial aimed at clamping down on scams and saving the millions lost to such fraudulent activities. Analysis conducted by the bank found that a third of all scam payments were directly moved to crypto exchanges, hence the decision.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Australia Faces Challenges</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Australia has faced many challenges in recent times. Last month, the crypto exchange </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-winds-down-australian-derivatives-division/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wound down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Aussie derivatives business due to regulatory issues with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The agency canceled the exchange’s license as it reviewed its local operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a Binance Australia spokesperson said that after June 1, users could convert their Australian dollar balances into Tether USD (USDT) to facilitate trading activities until the exchange finds a provider to continue offering deposits and withdrawals.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Another popular Bitcoin Maximalist has joined El Salvador’s national government. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has onboarded Saiffedean Ammous – author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Bitcoin Standard </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">– as an Economic Advisor to the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In his role, the author will “advise on matters related to various economic policies,” while supporting Bukele’s policy of “economic liberty and bitcoin,” according to a Bitcoin office statement. </span></p>
<h2>Economic Advice From Bitcoiners</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">President Bukele </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1661376373477330947" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">met</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with the Ammous last week to discuss a range of topics including “economics, hydroponics, cattle breeding, urban planning,” according to a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1662288676657790976" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">retweeted Twitter post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the author’s account.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1663530702791655424" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">National Bitcoin Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Ammous also lectured students of El Salvador’s Bitcoin and Lightning </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/el-salvador-launches-bitcoin-lightning-dev-training-office/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">developer program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Cubo+, during his stay.<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When the author of the Bitcoin Standard met the leader of Bitcoin Country, great things were bound to happen.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/saifedean?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@saifedean</a> is joining us as Economic Advisor to the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador.</p>
<p>Welcome to the winning team, Dr Ammous! <a href="https://t.co/LyIljvKvtz" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/LyIljvKvtz</a></p>
<p>&mdash; The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1663530702791655424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As an Austrian economist, best-selling author &amp; well-known bitcoiner Saifedean will make a great addition to President Bukele&#8217;s bitcoin team,” stated the office on Tuesday. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Austrian economics is a school of thought that advocates for little to no government intervention in the economy, and allowing the free market to determine the price of goods and services. This contrasts with the “Keynesian” school of economics taught in most Universities today, which advocates for government intervention through monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Bitcoin Standard</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Saifedean makes the case for why the world would fare better on an Austrian model. As such, he promotes Bitcoin as an ideal currency for the world to use, since its code-enforced supply of 21 million units prevents governments from mismanaging the economy and diluting its citizens’ savings.</span></p>
<h2>Teaming Up With Bitcoin Maximalists</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Bitcoin Office is </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/el-salvador-launches-a-national-bitcoin-office-onbtc/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">designed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to oversee all Bitcoin-related projects in El Salvador, and to coordinate with other countries on initiatives related to the asset. It’s also worked closely with the nation’s officials to develop policies related to the crypto sector at large. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ammous is widely regarded as a “Bitcoin maximalist” – someone who is incredibly bullish on Bitcoin, but rejects most other cryptocurrencies as either redundant technology or outright scams. Existing members of the agency – including former television host </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/max-keiser-in-el-salvador-bitcoin-as-perfect-money-creates-confidence-in-leaders-like-president-bukele/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Max Keiser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and Stacey Herbert – also fall into this camp. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">El Salvador&#8217;s crypto policy has already evolved to reflect this view to some degree. While being the first and only country to establish Bitcoin as legal tender, the nation passed a law in January </span><a href="https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1595978606785732611" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">requiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> non-Bitcoin assets to be approved by the national securities regulator. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[According to CZ, buying a bank would not guarantee future debankings and would thus be a suboptimal solution.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following increased regulatory action from the SEC and other local and global watchdogs, members of the crypto community have been worrying about the industry&#8217;s future relationship with the banking sector.</p>
<h2>Pivot to Europe in The Cards</h2>
<p>The restlessness surrounding future crypto regulation was amplified following the collapse of both Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, both of which supplied much of the infrastructure needed to keep the crypto world tethered to the banking sector.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the SEC’s refusal to respond to requests for <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-sec-has-made-up-its-mind-to-deny-petition/" data-wpel-link="internal">information</a> from Coinbase and others signals to crypto platforms willing to cooperate that clear regulatory agreements with U.S. institutions made in good faith may be a ways off.</p>
<p>Some firms – like Gemini, who recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gemini-will-base-european-operations-in-dublin-ireland/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> the establishment of an EU HQ in Ireland – decided to look towards Europe instead.</p>
<h2>Binance Thinks Outside The Box</h2>
<p>Binance does not operate within the United States. In order to provide service to U.S. customers, Binance.US was launched. Although the two platforms share the same name, Binance.US has a different organizational structure and does not report to CZ or other members of the global company&#8217;s C-suite.</p>
<p>For several months, Binance has been looking for solutions to the tenuous relationship that crypto currently has with the banking sector, especially following recent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-australia-banned-by-big-four-bank-westpac-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">spats</a> with Australian banks and fiat providers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Fellow Binancians,</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that with immediate effect we are unable to facilitate PayID AUD deposits for Binance users due to a decision made by our third party payment service provider. We understand from our third party payment service provider that Bank…</p>
<p>— Binance Australia (@Binance_AUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1659018600496373760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">May 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In an interview taken on the Bankless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1mKwAxwAJ0&amp;t=2s" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">podcast</a>, CZ stated that he and his team briefly floated the idea of simply buying a bank outright in order to solve these kinds of issues without depending on others. However, they ultimately decided against it.</p>
<p>According to the exec, the problems cryptocurrency platforms face would not be solved by simply buying a bank. Even if a bank was purchased in the U.S., this would not guarantee regulatory approval in other territories.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the costs involved in buying and operating a bank could prove useless since regulators could simply forbid the bank from interacting with crypto anyway.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Banks are not cheap. Banks are very expensive for very little business revenue. [&#8230;] The amount of capital required is quite high, and the regulatory approval for buying a bank is the same or more as setting up a new bank, which is very onerous If the banking regulators say, ‘Look, you can’t work with crypto’ then they can take your license away if you do. So buying a bank doesn’t prevent regulators from telling you, “No, you can’t touch crypto.” Even then, we would need corresponding banks all over the world.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, CZ stated that he and his company are still considering making smaller investments in the banking sector, even if buying a banking institution outright is completely off the table.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are bracing themselves for a bearish wave, as several market analysts are now predicting a downturn for this popular meme coin.</p>
<p>SHIB is now trading 45% lower than the high of February 4 – with the price chart hinting that further downside is highly likely.</p>
<p>However, amid the gathering storm around Shiba Inu, a new meme coin, <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes (WSM)</a>, has exploded onto the scene – amassing over $1.1 million through its presale in less than four days.</p>
<h2>Further Downside Possible for SHIB as Bearish Sentiment Prevails?</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is hovering around the $0.00000870 level. Per CoinGecko, the token has a market cap of just over $5.1 billion – a staggering $35 billion lower than during the bull run of October 2021.</p>
<p>SHIB&#8217;s value has steadily decreased since then, with the token now trading 89% lower than its all-time high.</p>
<p>Adding salt to the wound, SHIB is up just 7.7% since the start of 2023, in stark contrast to Bitcoin’s (BTC) impressive 67% rally.</p>
<p>The situation doesn&#8217;t look like it will get any better in the short term, with data from CoinGlass <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/SHIB" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">revealing</a> that the Long/Short (24h) ratio for SHIB derivatives is now below 1 on most exchanges.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-253091" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-5.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="196" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-5-300x98.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-5-50x16.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This indicates that there are more short positions than long positions – commonly interpreted as a bearish signal.</p>
<p>Much of the bearish sentiment surrounding Shiba Inu is driven by the development team&#8217;s broken promises concerning the Shibarium scaling solution and the project’s planned metaverse.</p>
<p>Both of these plans have been delayed on several occasions, and there&#8217;s still no concrete launch date – meaning investors’ patience is now wearing thin.</p>
<h2>SHIB Bulls Brace for Descent to 0.0000078</h2>
<p>Considering these factors, one of the likely trajectories is down for Shiba Inu – which will make for grim reading for SHIB bulls.</p>
<p>SHIB is now trading well below the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), clearly highlighting the token’s bearish trend.</p>

<p>More ominous is the giant bear flag on the daily timeframe – a pattern that usually precipitates a rapid price drop.</p>
<p>If a drop does occur, the likely destination will be the $0.0000078 level. This level held as support in June and December 2022 – and SHIB holders will be hoping for a similar reaction if this scenario plays out.</p>
<p>Should SHIB drop to this support zone, it would represent a 10% fall from today’s price.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Bursts onto The Scene &amp; Raises $1.1m in Days</h2>
<p>Despite the bearish outlook for Shiba Inu, there’s a beacon of hope emerging for meme coin lovers – <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes (WSM)</a>.</p>
<p>Backed by an enormous community and appealing tokenomics, the Wall Street Memes project has raised over $1.1 million in less than four days.</p>
<p>One of the main catalysts for this instant success is Wall Street Memes’ massive social media presence, which stands at over one million “degens.&#8221;</p>

<p>The official Wall Street Memes<a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallstbets/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Instagram account</a> has amassed more than 523,000 followers, while the project’s<a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Twitter page</a> is not far behind, commanding an audience of 217,000.</p>
<p>This extensive community has even drawn the attention of some big hitters, with tech mogul Elon Musk<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1649784663924244482" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> engaging</a> with Wall Street Memes on two separate occasions.</p>
<p>A key reason for the community’s colossal size is the trailblazing Wall St Bull NFT collection, which sold out in 32 minutes back in 2021.</p>
<p>Yet, <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes’</a> team is continually pushing the boundaries of innovation and has recently launched a new NFT collection on the Bitcoin network – capitalizing on the popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals.</p>
<p>All of this has combined to create a massive buzz around the WSM token, designed to allow holders to benefit from the growth of the Wall Street Memes community.</p>
<p>Currently, Stage 2 of the 30-stage presale is in progress, meaning investors can buy WSM for just $0.0256. However, the token price will increase incrementally between stages.</p>
<p>Overall, Wall Street Memes presents a compelling alternative for meme coin fans worldwide – and if the project&#8217;s early momentum is any indication, things are just getting started.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chip-manufacturing giant NVIDIA (NDVA) surpassed a $1 trillion market cap, bringing the company’s total value close to that of all cryptocurrencies in the world combined.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The company’s stock opened at $405.96 on Tuesday, before rising as high as $416.39 by 9:50 am ET. The 6% pump marked a 52-week high for the company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shares have since cooled to just $402.53 a piece as of 12:47 pm ET, bringing them slightly below the $404.86 level needed to maintain a $1 trillion value. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The chipmaker’s stock began soaring last week after publishing quarterly earnings results well above consensus estimates, uplifting other firms in the industry. Despite initially tanking when the market opened, Intel (INTC) has now also risen by 3.17% on the day. </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chipmakers have rebounded in 2023 as tech companies broadly rise in response to slowing interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. </span></li>

			            <description><![CDATA[According to the AI chatbot, the primary cryptocurrency exceeded the $100K mark "on multiple occasions" in 2021 and 2022.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although it was launched less than a year ago in its current version, ChatGPT has already made massive strides in the AI community and has become a go-to chatbot for countless questions and inquiries.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the AI virtual machine is not perfect, makes certain mistakes, and cannot be trusted blindly.</p>
<h2>No, ChatGPT, BTC Has Not Reached $100K Yet</h2>
<p>The AI chatbot took the world by storm last year as it managed to answer (almost) all questions and queries it was asked with spectacular precision. Being powered by artificial intelligence, it manages to provide real-life answers as it continues to readjust.</p>
<p>However, there are also a rising number of <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/thats-not-right-how-to-tell-chatgpt-when-its-wrong" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reports</a> that ChatGPT has got some facts wrong, so we decided to test it from a bitcoin perspective. In general, the chatbot answers correctly questions regarding the largest cryptocurrency, including what it is, how it operates, its decentralized nature, what is mining, etc.</p>
<p>However, it made one interesting mistake. On the question of whether the primary digital asset had ever reached or exceeded $100,000, ChatGPT answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yes, Bitcoin has reached and surpassed the $100,000 price mark. Bitcoin experienced a significant price rally, and on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, it reached and exceeded $100,000 per Bitcoin.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s even more confusing about this is the fact that the chatbot admits its knowledge was cut off in September 2021, so how does it know that BTC exceeded $100,000 on &#8220;multiple occasions&#8221; in 2022?</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Real ATH</h2>
<p>The $100,000 milestone has a particularly special sentiment for the cryptocurrency community and the BTC maxis specifically. Recall that Twitter turned to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-laser-eyes-meme-not-a-coincidence-that-this-marked-a-local-top-for-bitcoin-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">logos with laser eyes</a> a few years ago when the asset was registering new ATHs above $50,000 and $60,000 almost daily.</p>
<p>This was back in late 2021 when positive news regarding the asset came left and right, with multiple new bitcoin-related ETFs being launched even in the US, several large companies <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/not-just-microstrategy-these-corporations-hodl-top-10-stocks-with-exposure-to-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">buying</a> portions of the asset, and numerous legacy investors going live to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stanley-druckenmiller-predicts-potential-crypto-renaissance-if-central-bank-faith-is-lost/" data-wpel-link="internal">defend and praise it.</a></p>
<p>The eyes were everyone on CT, representing the community&#8217;s hopes and dreams that BTC will eventually (and soon) go into the six-digit territory.</p>
<p>What followed was precisely the opposite. The cryptocurrency peaked at $69,000 in November 2021 and headed straight south. 2022 was a lot less favorable as BTC slumped to under $17,000 by the end of it. Despite the positive start of 2023, with bitcoin trading nearly 60% higher, the asset is still far away from the $100,000 mark.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tenet is a layer-1 network that&#8217;s focused predominantly on the expansion of use cases related to liquid staking derivatives (LSDs).</p>
<ul>
<li>According to a press release shared with <em>CryptoPotato, </em>Tenet has forged a partnership with LayerZero aimed at boosting the adoption of LSDs.</li>
<li>LayerZero, in turn, is an omnichain interoperability protocol that&#8217;s currently valued at over $3 billion.</li>
<li>The first stage of the initiative would be to set up a LayerZero endpoint on Tenet. It will enable anyone to create tokens and projects backed by the omnichain technology. In essence, this will connect Tenet to the numerous networks that are powered by LayerZero.</li>
<li>Speaking on the matter was Greg Gompan, co-founder of Tenet, who said:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The partnership with LayerZero is critical for Tenet&#8217;s success, as our protocol is cross-chain native at its core. While the initial integreation is helfpul in connecting our chain to the large LayerZero network to leverage its cross-chain liquidity, it also enables us to create a truly omnichain LSD for any asset. This reduces the barriers of entry and sets us up as the leading LSD ecosystem for all of DeFi.</p></blockquote>

<p class="ql-align-justify">A decentralized token that will shape gaming as we know it today is going live on the Ethereum blockchain on May 31st with the support of key Web3 leaders.</p>

<p class="ql-align-justify">The QWAN is a native token for gaming platforms and an expanding ecosystem of related platforms, hubs, services, and communities. With its decentralized community-led governance model supported by The QWAN Foundation, The QWAN works as a shared currency to shape the future of the global gaming industry and culture through a unified economy. Third parties can integrate The QWAN as an open and permissionless digital token, increasing the appeal of any application or platform.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Under the hood, The QWAN creates a unique gaming ecosystem that aims to empower gamers by rewarding their engagement in various gaming experiences. Through incentives and opportunities for ownership, The QWAN encourages gamers to discover rewards across ecosystems and involvement in community governance processes as part of their organic experience within their day-to-day gaming.</p>

By engaging all stakeholders, The Qwan aims to shape the future of gaming from the bottom up versus the traditional top-down approach, unlocking value across all segments of the gaming industry.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The launch is supported by strategic guidance from partners such as <strong>Horizen Labs Ventures (HLV)</strong>, which is the leading Web3 advisory and solutions provider, supporting some of the most prominent brands, protocols, and startups in the space.

</blockquote>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Banger,</strong> the gaming platform and marketplace, will be the first to adopt and integrate the QWAN token and support the vision of The QWAN Foundation. Given the open and permissionless nature of The QWAN, many more players in the gaming industry can be expected to onboard the ecosystem and announce the integration of the token.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">“We are thrilled for Banger to integrate The QWAN as its key gaming token and offer our gamers the opportunity to enhance their gaming experience. With The QWAN, our offering becomes very unique in the market and allows us to provide gamers with an experience that can&#8217;t be found elsewhere”, said Borja Villalobos, Banger CEO.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Mahe,, Seychelles, May 30th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.digifinex.com/en-ww" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">DigiFinex</a>, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, has been granted a Pre-Registration Undertaking (&#8220;PRU&#8221;) exemption-based approval by the Canadian regulator (at the provincial level, Alberta Securities Commission, and other provinces providing reciprocal recognition). This license allows DigiFinex to operate in Canada in accordance with the terms of the PRU agreed with the regulator and provides a unique opportunity for Canadian clients to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on DigiFinex&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>The PRU agreed upon is the result of a lengthy and prudent discussion with the regulator and is a crucial regulatory requirement for cryptocurrency participants wanting to operate a dealer platform in Canada. To comply with the PRU, DigiFinex needs to put in place stringent measures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The regulator also demands adequate security systems be established and maintained to protect investors&#8217; assets and personal information.</p>
<p>Additionally, DigiFinex must ensure that it has proper risk management procedures in place to safeguard against market manipulation and other fraudulent activities.DigiFinex&#8217;s PRU was announced officially by the regulator in March 2023, making it one of a handful of operators with a certain pathway and timeline for achieving full approval from the Canadian government in the coming months. This achievement highlights DigiFinex&#8217;s commitment to providing a safe and secure platform for its users, in line with prevalent market and regulatory demand.</p>
<p>DigiFinex has always placed a strong emphasis on the Canadian market. In recent times, the collapse of prominent industry participants has caused a collective crisis of confidence in the crypto industry. In response, DigiFinex looked at ways to improve transparency, security and efficiency towards keeping client assets safe without compromising other aspects of its services. DigiFinex has partnered with Qualified Custodian Tetra Trust, bringing access to a qualified custodian solution.</p>
<p>As a regulated trust company, Tetra’s offering encompasses robust controls, including the maintenance of a suite of insurance products. In addition, Tetra’s partners maintain comprehensive client asset crime indemnity underwritten by a syndicate led by UK-based insurance powerhouse Lloyds. Along with other licensed dealer platforms in Canada, DigiFinex sets a new standard for asset protection in the industry and will undoubtedly attract more investors and traders to the platform.</p>
<p>DigiFinex is also committed to global compliance operations, working closely with regulatory agencies worldwide to achieve regulatory requirements. As a stable and reputable platform operating in the industry since 2018, DigiFinex prioritized the provision of transparency and reliability in cryptocurrency trading. The platform offers a wide range of trading pairs, advanced trading tools, and a user-friendly interface, making it easy for both beginners and experienced traders to navigate.</p>
<p>The PRU exemption-based license is an important milestone for DigiFinex, epitomizing its focus on providing its users with a safe and secure platform. The new regulatory regime highlights the increasing importance of regulatory compliance in the cryptocurrency industry and underscores the need for cryptocurrency participants to work closely with regulatory agencies to promote a safe and secure trading environment.</p>
