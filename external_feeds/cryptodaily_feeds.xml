			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hong Kong government has proactively advocated for major banks to embrace clients engaged in digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional financial institutions such as HSBC and Standard Chartered are finding themselves confronted with mounting pressure to adapt to Hong Kong&rsquo;s desire to become a hub for crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to an article on CoinTelegraph, both UK- based banks as well as the Bank of China, were pressured by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in a May meeting to start accepting crypto companies such as exchanges, as clients.</p>
Embracing the Crypto Community
<p>The Hong Kong government's initiative to encourage major banks to accommodate cryptocurrency clients marks a noteworthy milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognising the demand for crypto-related services, the government appears to be looking to allow crypto-related companies to do their thing and continue to come up with innovations that can disrupt the existing financial system.&nbsp;</p>
Navigating Regulatory Challenges
<p>While the acceptance of cryptocurrencies presents exciting possibilities, it also poses regulatory challenges for traditional banks. Striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and ensuring compliance with existing regulations is a key consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government's push for banks to embrace crypto clients is accompanied by a call for enhanced risk management and regulatory frameworks. This comprehensive approach aims to establish a secure and transparent environment that protects both banks and their cryptocurrency clients from potential risks.</p>
Embracing the Potential of Blockchain
<p>The Hong Kong government's push for banks to embrace crypto clients says much for China&rsquo;s rethinking of the crypto digital asset economy. It also signifies a deeper recognition of the transformative capabilities that blockchain technology holds.&nbsp;</p>
Catalysing Global Innovation
<p>Hong Kong's proactive approach to embracing crypto and its encouragement of banks to accommodate crypto clients sends a resounding message to the global financial industry. By positioning itself as a progressive and innovative hub, Hong Kong aims to attract international businesses and investors who see the potential in crypto and blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since inception, LEVEL has designed a protocol to serve as a functional alternative to centralized counterparty risk. After half a year of product testing, it&rsquo;s finally time to expand, and the LEVEL DAO has determined that Arbitrum will be the next ecosystem where Level will be deployed on.</p>
<p>LEVEL&rsquo;s Success Story</p>
<p>LEVEL has experienced phenomenal growth. In just the first month, LEVEL witnessed a notable $320 million in volume traded, generating over $400k in fees and bringing in more than 1000 community members.</p>
<p>As a testament to the product-market fit they found, it took just 55 days for the ecosystem to hit $1 billion in trading volume, leading to collecting $8.3 million in fees during that time &ndash; going from strength to strength with over $20 billion traded in the first half of 2023 alone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impressively, the most significant daily trading volume was $339 million on April 14, 2023, accounting for around a third of the total volume across Perp DEXs (Delphi Digital).</p>
<p>A Quick Look On-Chain</p>
<p>Total Volume: $17.4 billion, of which leverage trading volume accounts for $14.5 billion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total Collected Fees: &gt;$22 million&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, these collected fees are distributed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLPs (supply-side revenue) = 45%</li>
<li>LVL Stakers (protocol revenue) = 10%</li>
<li>LGO Stakers (protocol revenue) = 10%</li>
<li>DAO Treasury (protocol revenue - redeemable against LGO) = 30%</li>
<li>Reserved for Protocol Development (5%)</li>
</ul>
Assets Under Management (AUM): $30 million
<p></p>
<p>During this time, LEVEL has established itself as the leading perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) on BNB Chain, rivaling even the likes of GMX &ndash; a significant achievement considering the difference in total value locked (TVL) and market cap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Setting itself apart from competitors, LEVEL wrote its own codebase from scratch and pioneered the tranche system in DeFi. By leveraging its innovative dual tokenomics model (LVL and LGO), which perfectly fits a perpetual DEX platform, LEVEL has created a strong protocol growth flywheel, reflected in the simultaneous growth of platform volume and Treasury assets. This has resulted in achieving close to $10M in treasury liquid assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last but not least, LEVEL is taking DeFi on-chain governance to the next level, with more than 19 DAO Proposals submitted.</p>
<p>Truly decentralized governance, driving rapid iteration in product and incentive models for a fast-paced marketplace.</p>
Why Arbitrum?&nbsp;
<p>Even at a glance, Arbitrum looked like the most immediate choice for LEVEL, and this sentiment resonated with the majority of their community.</p>
<p>All new possible chains were evaluated according to their:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liquidity</li>
<li>User profile</li>
<li>Daily active users</li>
<li>Daily number of TXs</li>
</ul>
<p>Arbitrum crushes all of these criteria, securing itself as the fourth chain by TVL, thanks to its deep liquidity and a DeFi-native user base. An equally important factor included the sustained growth of unique addresses in the network, even after the ARB Airdrop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many critics speculated that activity on Arbitrum would sink after the airdrop. Nonetheless, the daily transactions on the network are steadily increasing, averaging around 1m per day &mdash; close to ATH if one does not take into account the days of the airdrop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering these factors, it is understandable why the DAO voted for Arbitrum, securing 53% of the total votes across 4 options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitrum is the home of DeFi, and a place full of open collaboration. The composable nature of DeFi on Arbitrum offers endless possibilities for new products and partnerships with other protocols. Some remarkable examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yield Aggregators</li>
<li>Money Markets</li>
<li>Other Derivatives (e.g., hedging, structured products)</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, this Layer 2 protocol is a fantastic fit for LEVEL as it houses a native niche of perp DEX traders who can benefit from the ecosystem&rsquo;s incentivized program for traders, shrewdly configured to drive protocol and treasury growth.</p>
<p>While the expansion to Arbitrum is the project&rsquo;s main priority, LEVEL is not stopping there. LEVEL will continue to expand in its goal to become a key piece of the wider omnichain infrastructure.</p>
Practical Developments
<p>Cross-chain infrastructure is being built to cement the marketplace as an omnichain protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of these developments, LEVEL is migrating the LVL and LGO tokens to the &lsquo;Omnichain Fungible Token&rsquo; (OFT) standard.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to enable the cross-chain aggregation of fees distributed to its stakeholders so that LEVEL users can earn yield anywhere in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The DAO treasury will also be united across the entire ecosystem, meaning LGO redemptions against the treasury will occur on all chains.</p>
<p>Following the recently approved proposal, LEVEL is utilizing LayerZero&rsquo;s technology to bridge 5M LVL to Arbitrum, to bootstrap liquidity and trader activity through auctions and other incentive programs.</p>
They have also begun migrating:
<ul>
<li>LVL/USDT Liquidity &mdash; to make LVL tokens more accessible to users on Arbitrum, LEVEL migrating the entire LVL/USDT pool (currently ~ $713,214) to Trader Joe Arbitrum ensures that new users trading for the first time will have the liquidity to access LVL tokens.&nbsp;</li>
<li>LEVEL Trading Pool Liquidity &mdash; enabling access to all trading features, migrating 3,555,192 Senior LLP (currently ~ $4,061,500) from the BNB Chain to seed trading liquidity on Arbitrum (50% of the protocol-owned Senior LLP supply).</li>
</ul>
<p>Future Plans</p>
<p>When it comes to future footprints, a key priority for Level Protocol is for the DAO to steer Level&rsquo;s journey towards exceptional growth.</p>
<p>LEVEL also remains committed to delivering an exceptional user experience, ensuring that their customers receive premium service and can trade using a top-notch UX.</p>
<p>Further solidifying its position in the DeFi space, LEVEL is actively seeking, discussing, and moving forward with several partnerships with additional Tier-1 projects, enabling them to expand its reach and utility across the industry.</p>
<p>LEVEL's success to date was achievable through the tremendous support from its community of users. Expanding to a cross-chain liquidity marketplace, the marketplace will release a first-in-kind utility-based NFT in just 60 days. All of these unique items will be exclusively for LEVEL's community of users, with allocation retroactively determined based on interactions with the protocol on both Arbitrum and BNB Chain.</p>
<p>Three categories will correspond to the three main facets of LEVEL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock Broker's Vest, Earned through proving yourself as a trader. The life blood of any financial hub, a Trader needs to look the part at his desk.</li>
<li>Auctioneer's Hammer &ndash;A key group of mechanisms at LEVEL, Auctions serve to widen the reach of the ecosystem as a whole. Embody the power of the Auctioneer with their Hammer.</li>
<li>Tattered Farmer's Hat &ndash; LEVEL wouldn&rsquo;t we be anywhere without liquidity. LPs take on risk enabling the entire marketplace to function. It ain&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s honest work.</li>
</ul>
<p>LEVEL's vision is to become a leading omnichain trading platform, and their recent expansion to Arbitrum marks the first step towards realizing this goal.</p>
<p>Expanding their services into other DeFi sectors is another avenue they are exploring. The goal is to become a multi-chain liquidity aggregator where fragmented liquidity across different ecosystems can be unified in a single pool, allowing users to trade, swap, and borrow seamlessly.</p>
<p>LEVEL is excited to embark on this omnichain journey, transforming the way people engage with DeFi and revolutionizing their trading experience.</p>
Step into the LEVEL Ecosystem!
<ul>
<li>Trade a range of blue chip assets on LEVEL now!</li>
<li>Buy LVL and begin participating in our ecosystem</li>
</ul>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Stockholm, Sweden, June 15th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM bridging the Physical and Virtual Worlds of Fashion through Blockchain Innovation</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Swedish-American fashion brand BLK DNM today unveils the first-ever example of connected fashion (garments that exist both physically and virtually, each aspect &lsquo;twinned&rsquo; via technology) with the launch of BLK DNM Society and integration of blockchain-powered hardware and software into its products.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM Society, built on tech designed by blockchain innovator and BLK DNM owner ChromaWay, will grant each garment a unique and recordable identity in both the physical and virtual worlds, while also rewarding ethical behaviour and granting brand influence to owners.</p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify">Blockchain-powered &lsquo;digital garment ID&rsquo; microchips will give each item a unique identity and record of its history</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Chips form the hardware element of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem and rewards responsible behavior and ownership</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Tech will first appear in BLK DNM&rsquo;s FW 2023 collection</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify">The Hardware: Digital Garment IDs</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Future BLK DNM clothing will be fitted with a &lsquo;digital garment ID&rsquo; - an undetectable chip that gives each physical item a unique and recordable identity. Some of the first features of the digital garment IDs will include:</p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify">Authentication of the garment as genuine, eliminating fakes and counterfeiting</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Rewarding responsible behaviours of treasuring and caring for clothing long-term, such as refurbs and second-hand purchases</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Recording each individual garment's unique history - owners, events and places worn, repairs and alterations - enabling the item to accrue emotional and monetary value over time</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Acting as a digital ticket for entry to events</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Access to and voting rights within BLK DNM Society</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM Society</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The digital garment IDs are the first hardware elements of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem. The first example of connected fashion, BLK DNM Society is a community of BLK DNM owners, connected virtually by their physical items, who are rewarded for responsible behaviours and are granted voting rights on key brand decisions based on item ownership - thereby beginning the first ever process of decentralising a fashion brand&rsquo;s stewardship.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Each digital garment ID will create a &lsquo;digital reflection&rsquo; of the physical garment: a twin in the virtual world where the physical item&rsquo;s history and place within BLK DNM Society is recorded. The digital reflection can also be worn in the metaverses, catering especially to younger generations whose identities in virtual worlds are equally as important as in the physical.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">FW 2023</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Digital garment IDs will be revealed at BLK DNM&rsquo;s FW event in Paris on June 21st. For this first collection, the chips will be embedded in only leather items, with subsequent collections introducing more items to BLK DNM Society through embedded blockchain-enabled hardware.</p>Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay, comments: &ldquo;This is totally futuristic. Nothing like this has been attempted in fashion before. It&rsquo;s very exciting for us, after much hard work, to see our technology elevating one of fashion&rsquo;s iconic brands into something completely unique.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stockholm, Sweden, June 15th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM bridging the Physical and Virtual Worlds of Fashion through Blockchain Innovation</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Swedish-American fashion brand BLK DNM today unveils the first-ever example of connected fashion (garments that exist both physically and virtually, each aspect &lsquo;twinned&rsquo; via technology) with the launch of BLK DNM Society and integration of blockchain-powered hardware and software into its products.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM Society, built on tech designed by blockchain innovator and BLK DNM owner ChromaWay, will grant each garment a unique and recordable identity in both the physical and virtual worlds, while also rewarding ethical behaviour and granting brand influence to owners.</p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify">Blockchain-powered &lsquo;digital garment ID&rsquo; microchips will give each item a unique identity and record of its history</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Chips form the hardware element of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem and rewards responsible behavior and ownership</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Tech will first appear in BLK DNM&rsquo;s FW 2023 collection</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify">The Hardware: Digital Garment IDs</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Future BLK DNM clothing will be fitted with a &lsquo;digital garment ID&rsquo; - an undetectable chip that gives each physical item a unique and recordable identity. Some of the first features of the digital garment IDs will include:</p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify">Authentication of the garment as genuine, eliminating fakes and counterfeiting</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Rewarding responsible behaviours of treasuring and caring for clothing long-term, such as refurbs and second-hand purchases</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Recording each individual garment's unique history - owners, events and places worn, repairs and alterations - enabling the item to accrue emotional and monetary value over time</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Acting as a digital ticket for entry to events</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Access to and voting rights within BLK DNM Society</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify">BLK DNM Society</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The digital garment IDs are the first hardware elements of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem. The first example of connected fashion, BLK DNM Society is a community of BLK DNM owners, connected virtually by their physical items, who are rewarded for responsible behaviours and are granted voting rights on key brand decisions based on item ownership - thereby beginning the first ever process of decentralising a fashion brand&rsquo;s stewardship.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Each digital garment ID will create a &lsquo;digital reflection&rsquo; of the physical garment: a twin in the virtual world where the physical item&rsquo;s history and place within BLK DNM Society is recorded. The digital reflection can also be worn in the metaverses, catering especially to younger generations whose identities in virtual worlds are equally as important as in the physical.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">FW 2023</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Digital garment IDs will be revealed at BLK DNM&rsquo;s FW event in Paris on June 21st. For this first collection, the chips will be embedded in only leather items, with subsequent collections introducing more items to BLK DNM Society through embedded blockchain-enabled hardware.</p>Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay, comments: &ldquo;This is totally futuristic. Nothing like this has been attempted in fashion before. It&rsquo;s very exciting for us, after much hard work, to see our technology elevating one of fashion&rsquo;s iconic brands into something completely unique. This has the potential to transform people&rsquo;s relationships with the clothes they wear and the brands they buy. No longer does the relationship with the customer end at the checkout.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, has announced the launch of its new subscription-based Bitcoin cloud mining services. The move comes as a surprise amidst the ongoing regulatory challenges Binance is facing in the United States.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's Bitcoin Cloud Mining Service</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance announced the launch on Twitter, claiming that users who are interested in Bitcoin mining but lack the necessary hardware can subscribe to these new cloud mining services and purchase hashrates. Currently, Binance offers 1 Terahash per second (Th/s) at a rate of $10.7280. An increase in the purchased hashrate corresponds to an increased probability of higher Bitcoin earnings through mining.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The BTC mining subscription service will remain active for six months. During this 180-day period, for every TH/s purchased, users could potentially earn 0.0004338 BTC. However, as of now, this product is only available on Binance's global website, indicating that users from the United States cannot access it.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Current Regulatory Trouble</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's decision to launch these cloud mining services comes at a particularly challenging time for the cryptocurrency exchange. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken legal action against Binance, alleging violations of securities laws. Alongside this, the SEC has filed for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of Binance.US.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The SEC has accused Binance of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, and CZ has been accused of failing to prevent U.S. customers from using the platform and providing misleading information about its market surveillance measures. According to the lawsuit, Binance and CZ were involved in an "elaborate scheme" to evade U.S. federal securities laws, which included creating separate U.S. entities and diverting billions of dollars in customer funds to Merit Peak Limited, a separate company under Zhao's control.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a press release, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the charges against CZ and Binance detail an "extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law." He further accused the defendants of misrepresenting their risk controls, manipulating trading volumes, and actively concealing crucial information, such as the platform's operations, manipulative trading by its affiliated market maker, and the custody of investor funds and crypto assets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance Building Forward</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the wake of these accusations, CZ has remained unfazed, choosing to dismiss the charges with a tweet stating "4", a reference used within the Binance community to encourage users to ignore fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). He assured the community that Binance's systems remain stable and that deposits and withdrawals are operating as normal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In preparation for the legal proceedings, Binance.US has already added former SEC enforcement co-director George Canellos to its legal team. Meanwhile, last week, Binance.US revealed that it has suspended USD deposits on its platform, a significant step in its transition to becoming an exclusively crypto-based exchange. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance is not the only crypto exchange facing regulatory pressures. Coinbase, another prominent cryptocurrency exchange, also found itself on the receiving end of a lawsuit from the SEC for alleged failure to register as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Binance's cloud mining services launch amid such regulatory challenges is a notable step, reflecting the exchange's commitment to advancing its services, even as it grapples with legal and regulatory issues. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Voyager customers were in for some good news a year after their assets were frozen, with the platform stating that they could withdraw a significant chunk of their crypto assets.</p>
<p>The protocol&rsquo;s customers will soon be able to check how much of their assets could be withdrawn, nearly a year after Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>
A Sigh Of Relief&nbsp;
<p>Paul Hage, Voyager&rsquo;s bankruptcy administrator, stated in a court filing on the 14th of June that the Voyager app would be updated by the 15th of June. Once the app has been updated, customers will be able to check the amount they can withdraw. Hage also estimated that the withdrawal period could start between the 20th of June to the 5th of July. The bankruptcy plan was approved in court on the 17th of May and will see Voyager customers initially receive around 35% of their claims through withdrawals from the Voyager app. They can also withdraw in cash after a period of 30 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voyager Court adjourned for the day. Fee examiner&rsquo;s findings approved by the judge app will come back online on or around the 15th of June Estimated window for withdrawals opening the 20th of June to the 5th of July 30 days to withdraw once the window opens all creditors will receive 35.72 initial distribution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once submitted, withdrawals will take between 3 and 7 days to process. Additionally, some liquidations may take longer depending on the liquidity available at the time of liquidation. Supported cryptocurrencies will be distributed in kind, while unsupported cryptocurrencies will be distributed in USDC. Hage stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The initial distributions of cryptocurrency will be made to creditors between three to seven calendar days after a withdrawal request is submitted on the Voyager platform.&rdquo;</p>

Three Arrows Capital Still Owes $650 Million&nbsp;
<p>Hage also added that the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) still owed Voyager around $650 million. The first tranche of withdrawals will allow customers to withdraw just over 35% of their funds. Once completed, the focus of the proceedings will shift to recovering additional assets that can be distributed to creditors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, an additional $445 million in customer funds could be made available to creditors. However, this depends on a final resolution of Alameda Research&rsquo;s preference claim against Voyager, which will happen sometime in September 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meditation between @investvoyager and @FTX_Official is anticipated to not start until Fall 2023. Anything less than 100% return would be a devastating result for Voyager creditors!&rdquo;</p>

Voyager&rsquo;s Bankruptcy Struggles&nbsp;

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voyager customers were in for some good news a year after their assets were frozen, with the platform stating that they could withdraw a significant chunk of their crypto assets.</p>
<p>The protocol&rsquo;s customers will soon be able to check how much of their assets could be withdrawn, nearly a year after Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>
A Sigh Of Relief&nbsp;
<p>Paul Hage, Voyager&rsquo;s bankruptcy administrator, stated in a court filing on the 14th of June that the Voyager app would be updated by the 15th of June. Once the app has been updated, customers will be able to check the amount they can withdraw. Hage also estimated that the withdrawal period could start between the 20th of June to the 5th of July. The bankruptcy plan was approved in court on the 17th of May and will see Voyager customers initially receive around 35% of their claims through withdrawals from the Voyager app. They can also withdraw in cash after a period of 30 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voyager Court adjourned for the day. Fee examiner&rsquo;s findings approved by the judge app will come back online on or around the 15th of June Estimated window for withdrawals opening the 20th of June to the 5th of July 30 days to withdraw once the window opens all creditors will receive 35.72 initial distribution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once submitted, withdrawals will take between 3 and 7 days to process. Additionally, some liquidations may take longer depending on the liquidity available at the time of liquidation. Supported cryptocurrencies will be distributed in kind, while unsupported cryptocurrencies will be distributed in USDC. Hage stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The initial distributions of cryptocurrency will be made to creditors between three to seven calendar days after a withdrawal request is submitted on the Voyager platform.&rdquo;</p>

Three Arrows Capital Still Owes $650 Million&nbsp;
<p>Hage also added that the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) still owed Voyager around $650 million. The first tranche of withdrawals will allow customers to withdraw just over 35% of their funds. Once completed, the focus of the proceedings will shift to recovering additional assets that can be distributed to creditors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, an additional $445 million in customer funds could be made available to creditors. However, this depends on a final resolution of Alameda Research&rsquo;s preference claim against Voyager, which will happen sometime in September 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meditation between @investvoyager and @FTX_Official is anticipated to not start until Fall 2023. Anything less than 100% return would be a devastating result for Voyager creditors!&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Flipkart, a leading figure in Indian digital commerce, has formed a key alliance with Polygon, one of the industry's key crypto firms building infrastructure around an ecosystem of Web3 products.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The result of this collaboration is the conception of the Blockchain-eCommerce Centre of Excellence, a hub for research and development. The center's primary focus is to navigate the nascent landscape of Web3 and the metaverse, mapping out the next phase of digital commerce.The Indian digital commerce heavyweight is partnering with Polygon Labs and Hang, a leading next-generation loyalty platform, to introduce a specialized loyalty program named FireDrops 2.0. Aiming to reinvent the wheel of customer engagement and loyalty, FireDrops 2.0, powered by Hang's loyalty platform, will use underlying non-fungible token (NFT) technology to incentivize millions of Flipkart users through gamification. The application of Web3 and NFTs to brand loyalty programs is expected to revolutionize brand marketing, storytelling, and customer engagement.</p>
Polygon x Flipkart: Loyalty NFTs via FireDrops
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The use of NFTs in the program allows for easy ownership and redemption of rewards, thereby generating new revenue streams for brands and enabling customers to participate actively in the loyalty ecosystem. The FireDrops program also envisions a dynamic marketplace where users can buy and sell rewwards, bringing flexibility to loyalty programs and enhancing brand engagement.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">FireDrops 2.0 aims to offer an immersive experience to users, enticing them with surprises, games, and rewards related to their favorite brands. These interactions could allow users to earn benefits like membership passes, lifetime discounts, and more, fosterling deeper connections between users and brands.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The partnerships underscores Flipkart's commitment to fostering innovation and expanding its tech offerings to transform the experience of online shopping for millions worldwide. As Flipkart steps into the Web3 arena, it is set to reshape the contours of commerce, consumption, and value generation in the digital world.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Jeyandran Venugopal, the Chief Product and Technology Officer at Flipkart, expressed his enthusiasm about the partnership:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;Innovation is one of the main pillars for Flipkart and we have consistently worked towards technology solutions to scale new frontiers and introduce new products and services,&rdquo; Venugopal shares.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Previously, Flipkart made its maiden voyage into the metaverse through eDAO, a project nurtured by Polygon. The venture, known as "Flipverse," has played a crucial role in redefining the dynamic between brands and consumers. It promotes novel, interactive experiences via non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Additionally, Flipkart's FireDrops&mdash;an accessible platform for NFTs&mdash;cultivates a space where creators, brands, and consumers can delve into the multi-dimensional value of NFTs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prominent brands such as Adidas, Adobe, Robinhood, and Stripe have already chosen Polygon as their entry point to Web3. Flipkart's decision to align with this flourishing ecosystem underscores its forward-thinking approach to harnessing the potential of blockchain. Polygon's recent developments, notably the zkEVM scaling solution, will be pivotal in accommodating the global influx of users in Web3's next chapter.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon's co-founder, praised the partnership when it first began sometime in late 2022, sharing that Polygon:</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">"serves as the bridge to Web3 for the world's biggest corporations. Our goal is to shepherd the next billion users into Web3, so our partnership with Flipkart to create the Blockchain-eCommerce Centre of Excellence is an exciting prospect."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Nailwal adds that Polygon recognizes the sheer amount of blockchain talent to be found in the country, and that such a resource forms opportunities for the partnership to stimulate R&amp;D, and further "solidify India's stature as a Web3 titan."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon's Current Regulatory Predicament</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon recently launched its Version 2.0 amid the troubles that it's currently facing with SEC's claim of $MATIC being a security. The crypto firm is currently expanding its efforts at privacy, and has since launched a zero-knowledge identity infrastructure program for Web3 with PolygonID.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In response to the SEC's allegations, trading platform Robinhood took the step of delisting Solana, Cardano, and Polygon, effective from June 27. However, it reassured its users that the removal would be restricted to SOL, ADA, and MATIC, and no other coins on the platform would be affected.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti (COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS) were the other tokens implicated, as regulatory scrutiny also hit major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Korean-based cryptocurrency lending service, Delio, has temporarily suspended customer withdrawals as a consequence of financial irregularities involving crypto investment firm, Haru.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In an update on its website, Delio revealed that it had paused withdrawals due to its funds being inaccessible in Haru. This follows the recent suspension of deposits and withdrawals by Haru itself on June 13, in response to undisclosed complications with one of its service providers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Haru, a platform that offers users up to a 12% return on its Earn Plus product, has yet to provide a detailed explanation regarding the ongoing issues with its service provider. This lack of communication and the subsequent suspension of services have led to speculation and concerns among its users, resulting in a significant surge in withdrawal requests.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Delio's CEO, Jung Sang-ho, confirmed this increase in a recent interview with Money Today. He noted that the difficulties Delio was facing resulted from a rapid increase in withdrawal requests following Haru's suspension. Jung Sang-ho also acknowledged a transactional relationship between Delio and Haru, but he refrained from commenting on the specific details, including the total amount involved.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Delio's platform offers a range of cryptocurrency lending and borrowing services, with advertised returns of up to 10.7%. According to the claims made on its website, Delio has processed transactions involving significant volumes of cryptocurrencies including 41,700 Bitcoin (valued at approximately $1 billion), 118,000 ether (valued at around $205 million), and $6.2 million worth of various altcoins.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The temporary suspension of Delio's withdrawal services has come as a shock to many in the Korean cryptocurrency market, highlighting once again the inherent risks and volatility associated with the industry. The move follows a string of similar incidents involving cryptocurrency platforms globally, underscoring the need for increased transparency, regulation, and security within the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These incidents have drawn increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities and have prompted calls for more robust oversight and legislation to protect investors. In many parts of the world, regulators are already working on new frameworks to address these issues and ensure greater security for investors.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The events involving Delio and Haru also demonstrate the interconnected nature of many cryptocurrency platforms and services. Problems at one platform can quickly spread to others, causing a ripple effect throughout the industry. This connectivity means that issues at a single platform can lead to broader instability and lack of trust in the market as a whole.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As Delio works to resolve the current situation, users of the platform are left in a state of uncertainty, with their funds temporarily locked. The incident underscores the importance of due diligence and careful risk assessment when choosing a cryptocurrency platform, especially those offering higher-than-average returns.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>An Aave proposal intended to prevent a particular account from accumulating more debt has led to significant controversy, with some stating that it violates the principle of neutrality in DeFi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposal suggested imposing a cap on using CRV tokens as collateral, preventing the wallet address in question from adding more loans.&nbsp;</p>
The Account In Question&nbsp;
<p>Many believe that Curve (CRV) founder Michael Egonov owns the account in question. Egonov had begun borrowing stablecoins on Aave in April, beginning with $37 million worth of Tether (USDT) being sent to Bitfinex and a further $51 million in USDC being sent to market maker Wintermute. More recently, Egorov deposited $24 million worth of Curve DAO (CRV) tokens to Aave to mitigate the liquidation risk of a $65 million stablecoin loan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Seems like Curve&rsquo;s founder has a $110m leverage position against his $CRV stack across all Defi. If not repaid at some point (spoil: it prob won&rsquo;t, my man is taking profit), this will cascade into a lot of bad debt for lending protocols.&rdquo;</p>

Liquidation Risk&nbsp;
<p>According to the author of the proposal, the address associated with the account (0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428) has gone on to accumulate over $67 million worth of debt in USDC and USDT using the AAVE v2 protocol and putting up $185 million worth of CRV tokens as collateral. The proposal&rsquo;s author expressed concern that the account could continue increasing its debt, increasing the risk that it could be liquidated if the price of CRV suddenly drops. Adding to the problem is the fact that CRV has suffered a recent decline in liquidity over the past few months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could lead to considerable slippage if the account is liquidated, as there may not be enough buyers looking to purchase CRV and take on such a significant amount of CRV tokens, leading to millions of dollars worth of bad debt for the Aave protocol.&nbsp;</p>
Freeze on CRV As Collateral&nbsp;
<p>According to Aave user DecentMuse, the wallet address is tagged as belonging to Michael Egonov, the founder of Curve. According to the user, the loan could be a way for Egonov to take profits from his activities on behalf of Curve. Financial modeling platform Gauntlet, the proposal&rsquo;s author suggested that the AAVE decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) freeze further use of CRV tokens as collateral for taking out loans. Such a move would allow the account to hold its current loan position but prevent it from accumulating more debt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposal found some support among users who criticized the account for taking on so much debt. One user wondered if the account intended to pay off its debt, adding that it constantly added to its position despite the token losing value.&nbsp;</p>
Proposal Criticized&nbsp;
<p>However, critics of the proposal defended the account. One user suggested that the account owner may believe that CRV tokens are undervalued, leading them to increase their use as collateral as their price declines. Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative founder, also put forward his views, adding that the AAVE DAO should not violate neutrality, which is one of the core tenets of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The intention of users or what they do with their funds is not our primary concern. Users should be free to utilize the protocol as they see fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far, the proposal is only listed as a &ldquo;recommendation,&rdquo; meaning it has not yet been turned into an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP), which the DAO can vote on. However, Gauntlet has stated that turning it into a formal AIP is the next step.&nbsp;</p>
An Ongoing Debate&nbsp;
<p>There is an ongoing debate in the larger blockchain ecosystem regarding the limits of censorship resistance. In January, Bitcoin saw a similar debate where users complained of high fees caused by some users minting and trading ordinals. Some Bitcoin users wanted a ban on Ordinals, while others opposed a ban, stating it would be censorship. In April, Tether blacklisted an address that drained $25 million from EVM-front-running bots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jayanti Kanani, Polygon co-founder, stated that the blacklisting could establish a bad precedent and lead to more transactions being censored. However, ZachXBT, the on-chain sleuth, stated that Tether could have been forced to act by a court order.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve did not raise rates for the first time since the inflation-inspired start of its rapid interest rate expansion. However, crypto continues its downward slide.</p>
Fed intervention
<p>A Fed pivot is on the horizon even though it may not start to actually reduce interest rates until next year. This was certainly coming given that the current mad series of interest rate hikes is forcing the economy into recession.</p>
<p>Never before has the Fed tightened as quickly and as harshly as this following Biden and Yellen&rsquo;s claims back in July of 2021 that inflation was only &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.</p>
<p>History tells us that our boom and bust cycles are caused by government and central bank manipulation of credit, and that government intervention in the markets is always a bad thing and could probably be said to be axiomatic.</p>
Attempted eradication of crypto
<p>In such a chaotic world where the dollar and all other fiat currencies are being debased like crazy, it appears that the last thing the US government needs is the slightest hint of competition to its currency.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the government sees this competition coming on two fronts. It is now understanding the full import of cryptocurrencies - which might be classified as a type of private money.</p>
<p>After huge successes for some cryptocurrencies, admittedly mostly driven by hype and speculation, the US government has probably decided to try and eradicate them through the auspices of its enforcement agencies (SEC and CFTC).</p>
<p>A systemic attack on the crypto ecosystem is now taking place and lacking liquidity and with many crypto investors fleeing the sector the market is bleeding out.</p>
Bitcoin unassailable?
<p>However, there is one cryptocurrency that even the US government would have the devil of a job in taking down, and that is bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most decentralised and secure private money that exists in the world today, and given that it runs purely on code there is nothing any government or agency can do to stop it.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the rest of the market is obviously having an effect on bitcoin as large crypto businesses run into difficulties with sizable chunks of bitcoin on their books, and Mt Gox and the US government are selling their bitcoin into the market.</p>
<p>Once this selling pressure is gone though it might be expected that bitcoin would begin a dramatic rise as investors rush out of a worsening dollar, to say nothing of the rest of the fiat currencies.</p>
BRICS currency on the horizon
<p>The other front where the US can expect huge competition is from the BRICS nations. In August, at a Summit in South Africa, these nations are expected to announce a new currency which could be backed by gold and/or other commodities, or could even become a rival reserve currency to the dollar by having its own deep and liquid bond market, with the bonds bought by citizens in 20 or so countries that are in or on the point of joining the BRICS nations.</p>
<p>So whether it be Bitcoin or the BRICS nations, the dollar is likely to undergo the most profound and serious rivalry since it came into existence. With the unpayable debts owed by the US government and nothing but thin air and promises backing the currency, a new world order may be on the way.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase has become the latest entity to push back against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s proposed definition change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC had moved to expand its definition of an exchange in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
What&rsquo;s The SEC&rsquo;s Problem With Crypto?
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has been relentless in its dogged pursuit of everything crypto. In its latest salvo, the regulatory body sued Coinbase in a New York federal court. In its lawsuit, the agency alleged that Coinbase acted as an unregistered broker and exchange and demanded that it be &ldquo;permanently restrained and enjoined&rdquo; from doing so. The lawsuit came just a day after the SEC had sued Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The SEC in its press release, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since 2019, Coinbase has been engaging in an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program, which allows customers to earn profits from the &ldquo;proof of stake&rdquo; mechanisms of certain blockchains and Coinbase&rsquo;s efforts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crypto markets have been fairly nervous since the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, just a day before its action against Coinbase. According to the SEC, Binance mishandled funds and lied to investors and regulators about operations, a claim Binance refutes.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase Demands Clarity&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase has pushed back against the Securities and Exchange Commission, urging it to provide better clarity for the crypto industry. The SEC has responded to Coinbase&rsquo;s call for clarity, stating that it requires four months or 120 days to respond. The response comes after a barrage of court filings by both, Coinbase and the SEC. Coinbase had filed a writ of Mandamus against the regulatory body after it stated that it was &ldquo;in no hurry&rdquo; to respond to the exchange&rsquo;s demand for regulatory clarity. Coinbase had accused the agency of wilfully ignoring its request for immediate clarity. Prior to this, the SEC had responded to a previous petition stating that it would not give in to the exchange&rsquo;s demands.&nbsp;</p>
SEC&rsquo;s Proposed Definition Change&nbsp;
<p>In 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to expand its definition of an exchange. In April 2023, the agency reopened its comment period of the proposal, adding that this was needed as it planned to &ldquo;fold in DeFi and crypto.&rdquo; SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that this would help address comments on proposals from market participants, particularly those associated with the crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase has been pushing back against the SEC, especially since the agency sued the exchange, alleging it was offering its users unregistered securities. In a letter to the SEC, Coinbase stated that it has no authority to ban an entire industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, an agency&rsquo;s authority to regulate a particular industry does not include the authority to ban that industry, absent clear Congressional authorization.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coinbase also criticized the SEC&rsquo;s decision to include crypto and DeFi under its planned exchanges definition. The updated definition also applies to more traditional market makers. The exchange stated that it was especially concerned with the proposal&rsquo;s potential impact on decentralized exchanges (DEX). In its letter to the SEC, the exchange stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The proposed rule, as applied to DEXs, would be just such an impossible requirement. When creating a DEX, a software developer typically writes the code that creates the DEX and then publishes the code onto a public, permissionless blockchain, along with a mechanism for widely distributing the governance tokens that enable holders to alter select elements of the DEX going forward.</p>

Criticism From All Quarters&nbsp;
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s proposed exchange definition has come under heavy criticism from all quarters. Critics include the Blockchain Association, Paradigm, DeFi Education Fund (DEF), and Republicans from the House Financial Services Committee, some of whom have urged the SEC to withdraw the proposal. Paradigm stated that a DEX, particularly one using an automated market maker mechanism, does not involve any intermediary between buyers and sellers, adding that it used algorithms to balance crypto pools. It urged the agency to withdraw the proposal, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We write to request that the Commission withdraw its proposed redefinition of &lsquo;exchange&rsquo; and begin its consideration of how to adapt its regulations in the DeFi context anew &mdash; after rigorous economic analysis, genuine, broad engagement with the industry, and a close look at the limits of its statutory jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paradigm, the Blockchain Association, and Coinbase have also argued that the SEC has violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The APA governs and guides how agencies devise and implement regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rule change is vague and ambiguous, and the range of activities that may be captured within its scope are not yet fully fleshed out.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the coming years, the tone of the cryptocurrency market will be set by environmental projects, which will be increasingly used for mining around the world. New technologies and developments will be implemented in different parts of the world. And maybe even in outer space - such ideas and proposals already exist and are being discussed within the professional community. Interesting discussions took place at the Bitcoin Miami conference in the USA at the end of May.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining was one of the key topics in the latest report by Messari, a leader in cryptocurrency market research and analysis. The authors believe that the green agenda will increasingly dominate in this field, and it will be the driving force of the industry in the years to come.On the one hand, environmental friendliness will grow into an actual trend, and crypto enthusiasts will adhere to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Investing approach - environmental, social, governance aspects of investing. On the other hand, this trend will be supported by economic considerations, and the high cost of energy. As for this point, Messari analytics highlights a very indicative example for Bitcoin mining cost: in 2021, the mining of 1 bitcoin cost American miners in Texas about $5-10 thousand, and the coin itself was trading at around $50-60 thousand; its value went down in 2022, and the best price was estimated at $20 thousand with $15-20 thousand of mining cost.</p>
<p></p>
Serhiy Tron, Owner of White Rock Management, speaking at the Bitcoin 2023 conference
<p>As the coins value decreased, miners actively went looking for ways to reduce their energy costs. First of all, by making mining more environmentally friendly. The interest in hydroelectric power and electricity generation by flaring gas, byproduct of oil production, has grown tremendously. The latter technology not only provides cheaper energy for cryptocurrency mining, but also significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Reduction of the negative impact of mining on the environment.</p>
<p></p>

<p>"Being environmentally friendly is not just a fashion trend, but an economically profitable direction for mining. In some regions, the share of renewable energy in this field amounts to 40%, and even exceeds 70% in other regions. I think that interest will keep on growing, and global oil and gas corporations will cooperate more actively with the cryptocurrency industry. For example, our company has various projects in the U.S. underway: gas flaring in Texas and hydropower near Niagara Falls in the state of New York," said the founder of one of the world's largest mining companies, White Rock Management, Serhiy Tron.</p>

<p>White Rock Management, along with 250 other companies, has joined the Crypto Climate Accord for environmentally friendly and safe cryptocurrency mining. With operating offices in Canada, Sweden, Kazakhstan and the United States, the company implements a number of green projects and has plans to develop data centers in Switzerland and the U.S.Tron believes that coal, oil and gas constituents will gradually be outed from the energy consumed by miners. A similar opinion has been voiced by Coin Metrics co-founder Nick Carter, who has high hopes about the use of energy from flare gas in bitcoin mining; he believes this type of fuel can completely cover the needs of all miners worldwide inside the next 10 years. Crypto analysts' predictions regarding the development of alternative sources are backed by energy experts.A new report from a global energy think tank Ember emphasizes that the global energy system will very shortly enter a &ldquo;new era of reduction of fossil fuel production&rdquo;. Gas and coal generation volumes are expected to decrease, with alternative sources in extensive use.Ember's findings note that at the end of 2022, the expansion of wind and solar power accounted for 80% of the growth in electricity demand, and when combined with hydropower and bioenergy, 92% of the growth. By the end of 2023, low-carbon sources are expected to provide 100% of the growth in energy demand. Analysts provide an interesting example: the solar power plants launched worldwide last year would be powerful enough to supply an entire country like South Africa for a year, and wind power plants would provide almost the entire 12-month supply for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The price/quality principle will be always at work. Miners will do everything to reduce their costs, and increase their income from cryptocurrency mining, while preventing methane emissions and being environmentally conscious along the way. This, in my opinion, is worth the support of local authorities in different regions. For example, by tax incentives or other means," says financial analyst Vladyslav Kravets.</p>

<p>Particular interest in "green" mining is growing in the U.S. Local Marathon Digital Holdings launched the King Mountain data center in Texas, with a capacity of 280 MW, carbon-neutral by 70%. In addition, this spring the company announced a joint project with Zero Two, designed to construct two new 200 MW and 50 MW zero-carbon sites in the UAE (Abu Dhabi). Also, BIT Mining Limited reported building a 57.2 MW facility in the same state, running by 85% on clean energy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This does not come as a surprise, since the Americans have been growing generally more interested in cryptocurrency as of late. The bigger it is, the greater the interest of local miners in more environmentally friendly and cheaper crypto mining. The analytics service Ahrefs recently estimated that the word "Bitcoin" has been looked up 1.9 million times in Google search in the U.S. over the past 12 months. It topped the search ranking, coming before the scandalous former president Donald Trump, news, Elvis Presley, Disney and Spider-Man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For years, Texas was considered the home of the American shale gas and oil revolution, but it has now become the go-to place for cryptocurrency miners. Miners have realized that energy from flare gas can be used profitably to mine crypto. Our company is using it already. Also, this way we significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Around 400 million tons of carbon dioxide make their way to the atmosphere annually, but the crypto community can reduce this figure significantly," assures Serhiy Tron.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the miners&rsquo; interest in green energy will grow as the interest in cryptocurrencies as such multiplies. This process is gradually spreading around the world, although not always in transparent ways.For example, in May, during the bankruptcy of BlockFi and Celsius, it was revealed that Druk Holding &amp; Investments (DHI), a state-owned investment bank in the Asian Kingdom of Bhutan, was secretly (without public knowledge) mining bitcoin. This country employs hydropower, with natural availability of high-altitude mountains with fresh air that allow cooling down the equipment. Mining is carbon-neutral and, as DHI assures, self-sustaining.The interest in cryptocurrencies is increased in the Seychelles, and local Finance Minister Naadir Hassan stated in April that his government is working out the requirements for the registration and licensing of specialized companies. Also, state authorities in Europe's Liechtenstein have recently declared they&rsquo;re going to allow their citizens to use bitcoin to pay for public services. Although the head of the government, Daniel Risch, did not specify when such a possibility was to come in effect, but was adamant that it eventually would.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of what goes on in the crypto market and no matter what skeptics say about this industry, the interest for it does not decrease. Even after significant price swings of several coins and frightening statements about the crypto-winter. Steady focus of the investors and hi-tech companies is backed not only by the projects that&rsquo;s been already greenlit, but with new developments, ideas and discussions that do not stop. At the end of May, for instance, active debates on the future development of the market and its prospects took place in the United States, at the Bitcoin Miami conference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather interesting and large-scale event, which was helpful not for professional players alone, but for the curious newcomers as well. Highly-esteemed and acknowledged experts were represented at the event: Christopher Grilhault des Fontaines from Dfns, Joseph Ziolkowski from Relm Insurance, Domenic Carosa from Banxa and many others. Not only current problems were discussed, but some new developments, including those in the space industry, were spoken of openly, too. Quite gripping and productive. Once again, we were able to make sure that Bitcoin remains a powerful asset, and amid the challenging situation in the global economy and growing rates of inflation everywhere, attention and trust to Bitcoin is on the steady rise&rdquo;, summed up Serhiy Tron.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the coming years, the tone of the cryptocurrency market will be set by environmental projects, which will be increasingly used for mining around the world. New technologies and developments will be implemented in different parts of the world. And maybe even in outer space - such ideas and proposals already exist and are being discussed within the professional community. Interesting discussions took place at the Bitcoin Miami conference in the USA at the end of May.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining was one of the key topics in the latest report by Messari, a leader in cryptocurrency market research and analysis. The authors believe that the green agenda will increasingly dominate in this field, and it will be the driving force of the industry in the years to come.On the one hand, environmental friendliness will grow into an actual trend, and crypto enthusiasts will adhere to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Investing approach - environmental, social, governance aspects of investing. On the other hand, this trend will be supported by economic considerations, and the high cost of energy. As for this point, Messari analytics highlights a very indicative example for Bitcoin mining cost: in 2021, the mining of 1 bitcoin cost American miners in Texas about $5-10 thousand, and the coin itself was trading at around $50-60 thousand; its value went down in 2022, and the best price was estimated at $20 thousand with $15-20 thousand of mining cost.</p>
<p></p>
Serhiy Tron, Owner of White Rock Management, speaking at the Bitcoin 2023 conference
<p>As the coins value decreased, miners actively went looking for ways to reduce their energy costs. First of all, by making mining more environmentally friendly. The interest in hydroelectric power and electricity generation by flaring gas, byproduct of oil production, has grown tremendously. The latter technology not only provides cheaper energy for cryptocurrency mining, but also significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Reduction of the negative impact of mining on the environment.</p>
<p></p>

<p>"Being environmentally friendly is not just a fashion trend, but an economically profitable direction for mining. In some regions, the share of renewable energy in this field amounts to 40%, and even exceeds 70% in other regions. I think that interest will keep on growing, and global oil and gas corporations will cooperate more actively with the cryptocurrency industry. For example, our company has various projects in the U.S. underway: gas flaring in Texas and hydropower near Niagara Falls in the state of New York," said the founder of one of the world's largest mining companies, White Rock Management, Serhiy Tron.</p>

<p>White Rock Management, along with 250 other companies, has joined the Crypto Climate Accord for environmentally friendly and safe cryptocurrency mining. With operating offices in Canada, Sweden, Kazakhstan and the United States, the company implements a number of green projects and has plans to develop data centers in Switzerland and the U.S.Tron believes that coal, oil and gas constituents will gradually be outed from the energy consumed by miners. A similar opinion has been voiced by Coin Metrics co-founder Nick Carter, who has high hopes about the use of energy from flare gas in bitcoin mining; he believes this type of fuel can completely cover the needs of all miners worldwide inside the next 10 years. Crypto analysts' predictions regarding the development of alternative sources are backed by energy experts.A new report from a global energy think tank Ember emphasizes that the global energy system will very shortly enter a &ldquo;new era of reduction of fossil fuel production&rdquo;.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>CryptoDaily&trade;&nbsp;is thrilled to announce the winners of our annual international award for daring Web3 builders and popularizers. Between May 22nd and June 5th, the expert jury reviewed dozens of stars that were shining in the industry throughout the past year, recognizing honorees across 4 categories: Entrepreneurship, Development, Design, and Marketing &amp; PR.</p>
<p>Driven by the genuine belief that the community should acknowledge its heroes, we established&nbsp;CryptoDaily&trade; Awards in 2022 to reward the most outstanding talents based on their merits. They all contributed to the Web3 ecosystem in many ways, from significantly improving its infrastructure and user experience to amplifying the Web3 business sector and promoting decentralized applications to the mass population.</p>
<p>While the main goal of CryptoDaily&trade; Awards remained the same, we brought a couple of novelties to the evaluation process. So, before we proceed with disclosing this year&rsquo;s results, let us first introduce you to the changes made. &nbsp;</p>
Panel of Judges
<p>To highlight the Web3&rsquo;s best and brightest minds of 2023, we invited the Fantastic Four team of subject matter judges, each contributing to the long-term trends in their own focus area throughout a year. We have thoughtfully chosen the jury members among 20 candidates for each category, paying special attention to their in-depth knowledge of the industry, multi-faceted activity, and remarkable individual achievements.</p>
<p>Some of them have promoted dozens of new millionaire businesses for the Web3 and blockchain era. Others have traversed the severe crypto market turmoil of 2022 with honor, and still others have proved that they were rightly praised by the previous&nbsp;CryptoDaily&trade; Awards.</p>
So let us dive straight into the list without further ado.
<p></p>

Renewed Methodology
<p>This year, the focus of the award was slightly shifted towards showcasing Web3's famous personalities and rising superstars who stood out with brilliant results and dynamic development. Our jury leveraged their professional outlook to make decisions, following a numerical and quantitative methodology with specific weighting given to:</p>
<ul class="lst-kix_i1vygxemccds-0 start">

<li>Evidence of results implemented because of the honoree's work;</li>
<li>Demonstrable enthusiasm for and creativity in Web3.</li>
</ul>
<p>All judges had two weeks to carefully evaluate more than 50 most ambitious Web3 innovators in their respective categories. Adhering strongly to the award&rsquo;s criteria, each jury member finally came up with two winners, presenting them as:</p>
<ul class="lst-kix_vwxb9fh82j84-0 start">
<li>Jury&rsquo;s choice&nbsp;&ndash; unrivaled gainers whose individual performance is the most worthy by all criteria;</li>
<li>Jury&rsquo;s runner-up pick&nbsp;&ndash; those who were one step away from the Jury&rsquo;s choice but couldn't outperform the winners. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to prolong the pleasure, CryptoDaily&trade; decided not to depart from participation in the assessment of nominees. The judges had final say, but we gave an opportunity to enjoy the celebration to our 4 personal favorites, rewarding them with a very special honorable mention&nbsp;&ndash; the prestiges title from CryptoDaily&trade; editorial board.</p>

Renewed Methodology
<p>This year, the focus of the award was slightly shifted towards showcasing Web3's famous personalities and rising superstars who stood out with brilliant results and dynamic development. Our jury leveraged their professional outlook to make decisions, following a numerical and quantitative methodology with specific weighting given to:</p>
<ul class="lst-kix_i1vygxemccds-0 start">
<li>Evidence of leading the development and delivery of cutting-edge Web3 projects;</li>
<li>Evidence of engagement with the business to drive Web3 adoption;</li>
<li>Evidence of skill set growth and personal accomplishments;</li>
<li>Evidence of exceptional leadership and excellence in the field;</li>
<li>Evidence of results implemented because of the honoree's work;</li>
<li>Demonstrable enthusiasm for and creativity in Web3.</li>
</ul>
<p>All judges had two weeks to carefully evaluate more than 50 most ambitious Web3 innovators in their respective categories. Adhering strongly to the award&rsquo;s criteria, each jury member finally came up with two winners, presenting them as:</p>
<ul class="lst-kix_vwxb9fh82j84-0 start">
<li>Jury&rsquo;s choice&nbsp;&ndash; unrivaled gainers whose individual performance is the most worthy by all criteria;</li>
<li>Jury&rsquo;s runner-up pick&nbsp;&ndash; those who were one step away from the Jury&rsquo;s choice but couldn't outperform the winners. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to prolong the pleasure, CryptoDaily&trade; decided not to depart from participation in the assessment of nominees. The judges had final say, but we gave an opportunity to enjoy the celebration to our 4 personal favorites, rewarding them with a very special honorable mention&nbsp;&ndash; the prestiges title from CryptoDaily&trade; editorial board.</p>
