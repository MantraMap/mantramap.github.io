Emphasizing that the national debt is &#x201C;too high,&#x201D; he cautioned that holders of the U.S. dollar will be in trouble.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki&#x2019;s Gold, Silver, Bitcoin Predictions</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has shared his predictions about the price of gold, silver, and bitcoin. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>In a tweet Monday, Kiyosaki explained that while he expects the price of bitcoin to reach $100K in the near term, he believes that it could soar to $1 million while gold will rise to $75K and silver will trade at $60K if the world economy crashes. Noting that he has been saying for years that gold and silver are God&#x2019;s money while bitcoin is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-he-likes-bitcoin-calls-btc-peoples-money/">people&#x2019;s money</a>, the famous author wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bad news: If stock & bond markets crash, gold & silver skyrocket. Worse news: If world economy crashes, bitcoin [will rise to] $1 million, gold $75K, [and] silver to $60K.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that savers who hold the U.S. dollar, which he called &#x201C;fake&#x201D; money, will be in serious trouble, noting that the U.S. national debt is &#x201C;too high.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Kiyosaki often said that gold, silver, and bitcoin are his preferred investments, emphasizing that they are the best for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">unstable times</a>. Following his warning about a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-we-are-in-global-recession-warns-of-soaring-bankruptcies-unemployment-homelessness/">global recession</a>, he cautioned in May that the world economy is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-world-economy-on-the-verge-of-collapse-warns-of-bank-runs-frozen-savings-bail-ins/">on the verge of collapse</a>.</p>
<p>The renowned author predicted in February that the price of bitcoin will hit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-500k-by-2025-and-gold-soaring-to-5k/">$500,000 by 2025</a> while gold will soar to $5K and silver will hit $500 during that time period. He recently started saying that the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will hit $100K this year, and $120K next year, which is the same prediction made by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-raises-bitcoin-price-forecast-now-expects-btc-to-reach-50000-this-year-120000-next-year/">Standard Chartered Bank</a>. This week, he urged investors to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-recommends-buying-silver-before-its-gone/">buy silver</a> before it&#x2019;s gone, noting that it is more affordable than gold.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki has also been warning that the U.S. economy is headed for a &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-of-crash-landing-after-us-rating-downgrade/">crash landing</a>.&#x201D; He previously said America is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-says-america-is-bankrupt-amid-us-debt-crisis/">bankrupt</a> and warned of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-america-is-dying-warns-of-hyperinflation-death-of-us-dollar/">hyperinflation</a>. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has been cautioning that a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosakis-warnings-giant-crash-incoming-end-of-us-dollar-approaching/">giant crash</a> is coming for quite some time. Moreover, he warned that the U.S. dollar will &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-insists-us-dollar-will-die-as-brics-summit-nears-41-nations-to-de-dollarize-the-world/">die</a>&#x201D; as the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) plan to launch a common currency.</p>

<h2>Coinbase Reaches &#8216;Critical Milestone&#8217;</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) announced Wednesday that it has reached &#8220;a critical milestone&#8221; by securing regulatory approval to offer crypto futures to eligible U.S. users. The announcement details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase Financial Markets Inc. has secured regulatory approval from the National Futures Association (NFA), a CFTC-designated self-regulatory organization, to operate a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) and offer eligible U.S. customers access to crypto futures from our platforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase filed an application with the NFA in September 2021 to register an FCM. The exchange stated Wednesday that the “approval has been secured.”</p>
<p>Noting that “This is a critical milestone that reaffirms our commitment to operate a regulated and compliant business and be the most trusted and secure crypto-native platform for our customers,” the announcement states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase will now be the first crypto-native leader to directly offer traditional spot crypto trading alongside regulated and leveraged crypto futures, on an integrated trading solution for our verified customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase is broadening its global presence. The exchange announced its official <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-launches-in-canada-executive-says-canada-well-positioned-to-be-a-global-leader-in-crypto-economy/">launch in Canada</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq-listed crypto trading platform is also currently engaged in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed charges</a> against Coinbase in June accusing the company of operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. Nonetheless, Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-disputes-secs-allegation-that-the-exchange-lists-9-crypto-securities/">maintains</a> that the tokens it lists on its platforms are not securities. In contrast, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler views <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, with the exception of bitcoin, as securities. Coinbase has appealed to the court to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismiss</a> the SEC lawsuit, arguing that the regulatory body has exceeded its statutory authority.</p>

On Monday, U.S. federal prosecutors also alleged that he used two FTX executives as “straw donors” to evade contribution limits.</strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Gave Money to Both Democrats and Republicans to Ensure FTX Continues to Grow</h2>
<p>The founder and CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>, Sam Bankman-Fried, used money stolen from customers of the trading platform to make over $100 million in contributions for political campaigns ahead of the 2022 midterm elections in the U.S., prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The government is also accusing SBF of directing two FTX executives to donate to candidates from both the Democratic and the Republican Party in order to evade contribution limits and conceal the origin of the funds, Reuters reported, quoting the indictment against him which also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>He leveraged this influence, in turn, to lobby Congress and regulatory agencies to support legislation and regulation he believed would make it easier for FTX to continue to accept customer deposits and grow.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new indictment does not provide the names of the two executives that Bankman-Fried allegedly used as “straw donors,” but other court documents show they are FTX’s former Engineering Director Nishad Singh and Ryan Salame, former co-CEO of FTX’s unit in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Singh, who donated $9.7 million to Democrats and their causes, pleaded guilty to fraud and campaign finance violations in February, while Salame gave more than $24 million to Republicans in 2022, but has not been charged with a crime. The numbers come from the Federal Elections Commission.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried was arrested and extradited from the Bahamas, where he resided and FTX was headquartered, in December 2022, about a month after his crypto exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. He has previously pleaded not guilty to stealing customer funds.</p>
<p>The former crypto billionaire now faces seven counts of conspiracy and fraud over the collapse of FTX, which was one of the world’s largest trading platforms for digital assets. The U.S. had to drop a charge of conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws because the Bahamian government had not agreed to extradite him on that count.</p>
<p>However, U.S. prosecutors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-face-campaign-finance-charge-prosecutors-say/">said</a> last week it will nevertheless be incorporated into other counts in a superseding indictment that would “make clear that Mr. Bankman-Fried remains charged with conducting an illegal campaign finance scheme as part of the fraud and money laundering schemes originally charged.”</p>
<p>Last Friday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-boss-sam-bankman-fried-in-custody-bail-revoked-remanded-to-jail/">jailed</a> SBF based on accusations of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-avoid-jail-denies-witness-tampering-in-ftx-case/">witness tampering</a> ahead of his trial scheduled to begin on Oct. 2. Bankman-Fried had been living under house arrest at his parent’s home in California on a $250 million bond.</p>

Notably, even amidst this hiatus, users can continue to hold their crypto within the Paypal ecosystem and are free to liquidate their digital holdings whenever they wish.</strong></p>
<h2>Paypal Temporarily Halts UK Cryptocurrency Buys</h2>
<p>British Paypal users will find their ability to acquire digital currencies curtailed post-October 1, 2023. This temporary measure, as highlighted in an <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_Crib_/status/1691661748359614481?s=20">email</a> to U.K. customers, is set to last until sometime in the early part of 2024, with the company assuring, &#8220;We expect to re-enable crypto purchases in early 2024.&#8221;</p>
<p>This development trails Paypal&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">introduction</a> of a stablecoin, PYUSD, anchored to the U.S. dollar&#8217;s value. To reflect on the timeline, Paypal had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-launches-cryptocurrency-services-in-uk/">unveiled</a> its crypto services in the U.K. in August 2021, with a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-completes-rollout-crypto-offering-uk-first-international-expansion-outside-us/">full-fledged deployment</a> by September. From that juncture, users could transact in four diverse digital currencies.</p>

<p>The catalyst behind this interim cessation? Paypal cites the “new rules enacted by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that require crypto firms to implement additional steps before customers can purchase crypto.” The digital payment juggernaut elaborated, “While we work to satisfy these new regulations, you won&#8217;t be able to buy crypto using Paypal.”</p>
<p>Emphasizing its stringent adherence to regulatory frameworks, Paypal added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We remain deeply committed to our compliance obligations and Paypal consistently works closely with regulators around the world to adhere to applicable rules and regulations in the markets in which we operate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the email remains non-committal on a specific restart date, Paypal expressed its regret for the potential inconvenience. The company reassured its U.K. customer base, promising to alert them once the service is back in action, enabling them to dive back into crypto acquisitions.</p>

While the company remains tight-lipped about the participants in this financial endeavor, this fresh infusion of capital catapults the firm&#8217;s post-valuation to $1.75 billion.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitgo Raises $100 Million From Undisclosed Investors</h2>
<p>Bitgo has successfully bagged $100 million in a Series C funding round, with the investors&#8217; names under wraps, as per a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/bitgo-bucks-crypto-downturn-to-raise-funding-at-1-75-billion-valuation">report</a>. Bitgo’s top executive, Mike Belshe, acknowledged the challenging market landscape. Yet, he emphasized the company’s commitment to licensing and regulatory measures, noting, “Regulatory safety is top-of-mind for everyone,” in a conversation with Bloomberg&#8217;s Hannah Miller.</p>
<p>This update comes on the heels of Galaxy Digital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/galaxy-digital-terminates-1-2-billion-bitgo-acquisition-deal-crypto-firm-still-plans-for-nasdaq-listing/">scrapping</a> its intentions to snap up Bitgo for a cool $1.2 billion in August 2022. Earlier, in June, Bitgo had its eyes on the beleaguered crypto custodian, Prime Trust, with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-asset-trust-firm-bitgo-sets-sights-on-prime-trust-acquisition/">acquisition plans</a>. However, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitgo-abandons-acquisition-of-prime-trust-amidst-nevada-based-custodians-ongoing-uncertainty/">deal fell through</a>. Prime Trust soon found itself <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-crypto-custodian-to-court-prime-trust-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/">filing</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the following month.</p>

<p>Though the Prime Trust deal went south, Belshe indicated to Miller that a portion of this fresh capital would fuel future acquisitions. He alluded to two potential buyouts already in the pipeline, as cited by Miller. While Bitgo remains mum on this round&#8217;s backers, past investors have featured big names like Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Redpoint, Goldman Sachs, and DRW Holdings.</p>

Bearish sentiment remained high as the session progressed, with the global market cap falling by nearly 2% today. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> also plunged in today&#x2019;s session.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) fell for a fourth straight session, as bears continue to regain momentum, following last week&#x2019;s gains.</p>
<p>After peaking at $0.07407 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.06893 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of this fall in price, dogecoin slipped to its lowest level since July 19, when price was at a bottom of $0.0682.</p>

<p>The decline comes following a downward crossover of the moving averages, which is also known as a death cross.</p>
<p>This week&#x2019;s bearish momentum intensified after DOGE moved below a support point at $0.0730.</p>
<p>Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged lower, dropping to a reading of 39.10, its lowest in four weeks.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, also remained in the red on Wednesday, dropping to a multi-week low in the process.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD bottomed out at $0.5918 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following Tuesday&#x2019;s high at $0.6275.</p>
<p>Similar to dogecoin above, today&#x2019;s drop in price saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> move to its lowest point since mid-July.</p>

<p>One of the catalysts for the sell-off was a breakout of a support point at the 40.00 mark on the RSI indicator.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 36.76, which is its weakest point since May, a point when the price was hovering around $0.4600.</p>
<p>Bulls will hope to reject further drops in price, however will first need to drop below an upcoming floor at the 32.00 zone.</p>

<h2>Binance Leads But Not Without Contenders, Says Coingecko&#8217;s Mid-Year Crypto Study</h2>
<p>According to the Coingecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/centralized-crypto-exchanges-market-share">research report</a>, Binance continues to dominate the centralized cryptocurrency exchange market with a 51.7% share, boasting a spot trading volume of $235.3 billion in June 2023. However, researchers noted a significant drop from its March peak of $559.8 billion, suggesting possible weaknesses.</p>
<p>The research spotlighted Upbit&#8217;s perseverance, holding firm as the second-largest exchange. Despite a dip to a 6% market share in May 2023, Upbit rebounded with an 8.1% share by June, backed by a $36.8 billion trading volume. Still, data shows the exchange experienced a 43.4% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) volume decrease.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-602803 size-full" title="2023 Centralized Crypto Exchange Study Highlights Winds of Change Among Top 10 Platforms" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer.jpg" alt="2023 Centralized Crypto Exchange Study Highlights Winds of Change Among Top 10 Platforms" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/binannceer.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The report underscored the rise of Bybit and Bitget in the second quarter. Bybit, celebrating a 26.7% QoQ growth, clinched the fifth spot among centralized crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, Bitget made notable strides to secure the seventh position. Both exchanges notably dethroned industry stalwarts Crypto.com and Huobi. The analysis also highlighted Binance&#8217;s declining trajectory.</p>
<p>Between Q1 and Q2 2023, Binance&#8217;s trading volume plummeted by 52.4%, which translates to a $823.9 billion decrease. The report said this decline starkly contrasts with the combined $270.8 billion drop of its nine closest competitors, suggesting regulatory pressures might be denting its dominance. Beyond the big players, the Coingecko report paints a vivid picture of a fiercely contested market.</p>

<p>Okx, holding the third position with a 7% market share, is closely trailed by contenders like Coinbase, Bybit, and Kucoin. With each commanding less than 7% of the market, the battle among the top ten continues to be intense. The study leveraged data from the top ten exchanges by recording the centralized trading platforms’ spot trade volumes between January 1, 2023 and June 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) extended recent declines on Wednesday, as traders began to anticipate the upcoming FOMC minutes report.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $29,061.95 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes after a high of $29,439.12 the day prior.</p>
<p>This drop sent bitcoin to its lowest point since August 7, when the price fell to a bottom of $28,660.</p>

<p>Wednesday&#x2019;s decline comes despite an upward crossover taking place between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.</p>
<p>The relative strength index (RSI) did provide a bearish signal however, slipping towards a floor of 42.00</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 44.49, which is also a seven-day low.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) edged lower for a second straight session, as the cryptocurrency moved towards a floor of its own.</p>
<p>Following a high at $1,842.95 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,816.33 earlier today.</p>
<p>Like with bitcoin above, this plunge saw the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency record a one-week low.</p>

<p>Whilst the RSI on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was heading towards a floor, ethereum&#x2019;s price strength broke out of its own support.</p>
<p>The index moved below a support level at 41.00, and is now tracking at 40.83, with the next visible point of support at 39.00.</p>
<p>Should this target be reached, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will likely be trading around the $1,780 mark.</p>

The court, however, commuted Steynberg&#8217;s three-and-a-half-year sentence to a fine of just over $31,000. Both Steynberg&#8217;s lawyers and the prosecution team have reportedly appealed the court&#8217;s decision.</strong></p>
<h2>MTI Boss Avoids Jail Time</h2>
<p>A Brazilian court has reportedly found Johann Steynberg, the CEO of Mirror Trading International (MTI) — the defunct bitcoin ponzi scheme — guilty in a case in which he is accused of using forged identity documents. However, according to a Mybroadband <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cryptocurrency/504222-boss-of-south-africas-biggest-pyramid-scheme-in-history-found-guilty-in-brazil-fined-r595000.html">report</a>, Steynberg, who was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, is unlikely to serve the jail time after the court reportedly ordered him to pay a fine instead.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ceo-of-mirror-trading-international-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-arrested-in-brazil/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, Steynberg, who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ceo-of-mti-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-flees-south-africa-in-a-possible-exit-scam-funds-blocked/">fled</a> South Africa in late 2020, was arrested by Brazilian law enforcement in December 2021. At the time of his arrest, Steynberg was found to be in possession of a forged Brazilian identity document. Following his arrest, South African authorities reportedly kickstarted the process to have the MTI boss extradited.</p>
<p>Steynberg’s subsequent attempt to block the extradition proceedings was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazilian-judge-dismisses-bitcoin-scam-masterminds-attempt-to-block-his-extradition-to-south-africa/">rebuffed</a> by a Brazilian judge in 2022. Since then, the MTI mastermind has seemingly remained in &#8220;precautionary detention.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Steynberg Appeals Against &#8216;Harsh&#8217; Sentence</h2>
<p>On why the Brazilian court commuted Steynberg’s jail sentence to a total fine of just over $31,100, the report cited the South American country’s penal code which states that jail terms of four years or lower for non-violent crimes can be converted to fines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the report said Steynberg’s lawyers have signaled their intention to appeal the court’s decision. The lawyers have said Steynberg’s alleged offense warrants a less harsh sentence than the three and a half years handed down by the court. The prosecution team, which is also appealing the court&#8217;s verdict, suggested that the punishment given to Steynberg is not commensurate with the offense.</p>

Under the new rules, issuers that want their fiat-pegged tokens to be labeled as “MAS-regulated” will have to meet certain requirements. </strong></p>
<h2>Singapore to Require Stablecoin Issuers to Maintain Minimum Base Capital and Liquid Assets</h2>
<p>Singapore’s central banking institution has finalized its new regulatory framework for stablecoins issued in the country. On Tuesday, the monetary authority said its features seek to ensure a high degree of value stability for the stablecoins it will regulate.</p>
<p>MAS emphasized that feedback from the public consultation launched in October 2022 has been taken into account. “Stablecoins are digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one or more specified fiat currencies,” the regulator noted in a press release and elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the &#8216;on-chain&#8217; purchase and sale of digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial authority also pointed out that the framework will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore dollar or any of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G10_currencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G10 currencies</a>, the world’s most traded fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>SCS issuers will have to fulfill some key requirements in order to apply for and obtain a “MAS-regulated stablecoins” label for their digital currencies. These cover several important areas such as value stability, capital, and redemption.</p>

<p>Reserve assets for the stablecoins will be subject to requirements relating to their composition, valuation, custody and audit, to ensure value stability, the MAS explained. Issuers will be obliged to maintain minimum base capital and liquid assets to limit insolvency risks.</p>
<p>They must also return the par value of SCS to holders within five business days from a redemption request and appropriately disclose to users information about the implemented value stabilizing mechanism, the rights of stablecoin holders, as well as the results from audits of reserve assets.</p>
<p>This label will allow users to distinguish MAS-regulated stablecoins from other digital payment tokens, the central bank emphasized. Its Deputy Managing Director for Financial Supervision, Ho Hern Shin, urged issuers that want their stablecoins to be recognized as such to prepare early for compliance.</p>
<p>She also highlighted that the regulatory framework aims to facilitate the use of stablecoins as a “credible digital medium of exchange” and a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems. It’s being introduced over a year after the collapse of stablecoin terrausd and cryptocurrency luna issued by the Singapore-registered company Terraform Labs. The stablecoin rules also follow the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/singapore-implements-new-crypto-regulations-targeting-custody-lending-staking/">implementation</a> of new regulations for crypto service providers in July.</p>
