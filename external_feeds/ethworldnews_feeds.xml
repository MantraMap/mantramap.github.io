<ul><li>A report by the Wall Street Journal stated that Binance slashed employee benefits last month.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange cited declining profits for cutting back benefits including work-from-home expenses.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed in a meeting last week that the company was still profitable.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange reportedly laid off more than 1,000 employees in recent weeks.</li></ul>



<p>Binance reportedly slashed employee benefits last month due to dwindling profits amid legal and regulatory trouble. The reduced benefits took effect on June 19, 2023, when the world’s largest crypto exchange cut back on several benefits, including fitness reimbursement. The crypto giant also indicated that more cost-cutting measures could be adopted in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Says Company Is Still Profitable</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-cuts-back-employee-benefits-citing-decline-in-profit-51d51cf7" rel="noopener">report</a> by The Wall Street Journal, Binance used its internal messenger to inform its employees about the slashing of benefits, which affected mobile-phone reimbursements and work-from-home expenses, among other benefits. The crypto exchange cited declining profits for cutting back employee benefits. A <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-lab-invest-15-million-xterio-game/">Binance</a> spokesperson stated that the company was reevaluating certain products, business units, and staff benefits to ensure that the company’s resources were being deployed properly. </p>



<p>During a company meeting on July 14, 2023, co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao told his employees that the company was still profitable. He added that the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had no impact on the company’s operations. As for the employee benefits, Zhao stated that he wasn’t sure when they would be reinstated.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Considering the current market environment and regulatory climate that has unfortunately led to a decline in profit, we have to be more prudent with our spending.”</p><cite>Binance&#8217;s internal message to employees</cite></blockquote>



<p>News of the slashing of employee benefits comes just days after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" rel="noopener">WSJ</a> reported that Binance had fired more than 1,000 employees in recent weeks. Former employees told the Journal that several hundred additional customer-service personnel were laid off by the crypto exchange last week. Changpeng Zhao revealed in the company meeting that there could be additional layoffs every three to six months.  </p>

<ul><li>DeFi exchange Uniswap has launched a new open-source blockchain protocol called UniswapX.&nbsp;</li><li>UniswapX will enable trading across automated market makers and other liquidity sources.&nbsp;</li><li>The new protocol is expected to provide users with more liquidity, better prices, MEV protection, and gas-free swapping.&nbsp;</li><li>The decentralized exchange’s governance token UNI surged by over 3% following the latest development.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Uniswap Labs, the decentralized finance startup behind the world’s largest decentralized crypto exchange, has launched a permissionless, open-source, and auction-based protocol called UniswapX. The new blockchain protocol will allow trading across automated market makers and other liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams Unveils UniswapX at EthCC Paris</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Uniswap, Chief Executive Hayden Adams unveiled the new blockchain protocol earlier today at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris. The DeFi exchange rolled out an opt-in beta for the protocol on the Uniswap Labs interface. Given that the protocol is still in beta, the majority of the orders will go through classic routing. UniswapX is currently available for Ethereum Mainnet and will be expanded to other chains as well as the Uniswap Wallet later. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-v3-deployment-on-fantom/">Uniswap</a> Labs stated that UniswapX will offer “next-level aggregation” by outsourcing the complexity of routing to an open network of fillers who compete to fill swaps in a cost-effective manner. The competitive filler forms will benefit the protocol’s users by offering maximum extractable value (MEV) protection, better prices, gas-free swapping, and zero cost for failed transactions. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With UniswapX, swappers will be able to use the Uniswap interface without worrying whether they&#8217;re getting the best price, and transactions will always be transparently recorded and settled on-chain.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The DeFi protocol stated that it would launch a cross-chain UniswapX that would combine swapping and bridging under one roof. This would include native asset swaps that would reduce the need for bridged tokens. Uniswap’s governance token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/" rel="nofollow noopener">UNI</a> surged by more than 3% following the announcement of the new blockchain protocol. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $5.97. </p>

<ul><li>Projects in the web3 and decentralized finance spaces lost nearly half a billion dollars to hacks and exploits in the first half of 2023.</li><li>DeFi accounted for a bulk of the incidents with over 386 exploit cases and $419 million in cryptocurrencies stolen from projects like Euler Finance.</li><li>A report from blockchain security firm PeckShield said the three most popular attack vectors were logic bugs, oracle manipulation, and privilege exposure.</li><li>Ethereum was also the most targeted chain with almost $300 million in losses.</li></ul>



<p>Projects built around web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) lost an estimated $479.4 million in cryptocurrencies and assets to hacks, exploits, and other malicious digital activity in the first half of 2023, a report from on-chain security intelligence shop <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1680897837947813894?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1680897837947813894?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PeckShield</a> said. </p>



<p>The report shows that protocols, platforms, and users in the crypto ecosystem suffered almost 400 major hacks in the last six months. Exploits and hacks were spread across the broader web3 landscape with DeFi accounting for most of these incidents. </p>



<h2>$419 Million Lost To DeFi Hacks</h2>



<p>PeckShield reported around $419 million in digital assets lost during 386 hacks or exploits on DeFi providers and platforms. Illicit actors attacked over 10 public blockchains with Ethereum bearing the brunt of these hacks. Crypto&#8217;s largest altcoin network and DeFi&#8217;s biggest chain Ethereum lost over $287 million to attackers, PeckShield said. </p>



<p>Attackers mostly chose three vectors to exploit DeFi protocols. 46% of exploits leveraged logic bugs in the smart contract codes deployed by projects. Oracle manipulation strategies were used during 15% of the hacks and privilege exposure constituted 14% of exploits on decentralized finance providers. Flashloans were also an alluring method for hackers, making up a staggering 71% of exploits. </p>



<p>The top three attacks on web3 projects were DeFi lender <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/defi-euler-finance-open-redemptions/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/defi-euler-finance-open-redemptions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Euler Finance</a> ($197 million), wallet provider <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/atomic-wallet-hacker-funds-garantex/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/atomic-wallet-hacker-funds-garantex/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Wallet </a>($65 million), and low-carb-crusader ($25 million). </p>



<p>While the number for H1 2023 nearly reached $500 million, the first half of 2023 pales in comparison to the infamous &#8220;Hacktober&#8221; last year where exploiters stole over $3 billion in a single month. </p>



<p>Total value locked on decentralized finance protocols across several chains was $44.64 billion, up from around $38 billion at the start of 2023 per DefiLlama data</p>

<p>XRP issuer Ripple believes that financial institutions in the U.S. could leverage the company&#8217;s on-demand-liquidity solution for international trade and payments following last week&#8217;s partial victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>



<p>“I think the answer to that is yes.”, Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> CNBC when asked whether banks would use Ripple&#8217;s ODL product after the ruling. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I think we’re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business, real-world problems in terms of moving value across borders without incurring obscene fees,</p></blockquote>



<p>The blockchain startup lost business after the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging that CEO Brad Garlinghouse and his company raised $1.3 billion through the sale of unregistered securities in 2020. Moneygram halted its partnership with Ripple in March 2021 due to uncertainty surrounding the case. </p>



<p>Before that, Bank of America paused a pilot program built on XRP technology started in 2019. The BOA said it was waiting for the outcome of the lawsuit before proceeding with any agreement. </p>



<h2>SEC vs Ripple Summary Judgment</h2>



<p>In December 2020, the SEC sued XRP creator Ripple Labs for allegedly raising $1.3 billion from unregistered securities sales. </p>



<p>Last week, Judge Analisa Torres issued a summary judgment siding with both parties on different fronts. According to the Southern District Court of New York Judge, the SEC&#8217;s claim that direct institutional sales of XRP constituted an investment contract and therefore qualified as illegal securities sales. </p>



<p>Judge Torres also sided with Ripple&#8217;s argument that programmatic sales to retail markets were not in violation of securities laws. The SEC could appeal the summary judgment which was requested by both parties and a trial on the matter is expected to follow after last week&#8217;s ruling. </p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP token <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/xrp-up-exchanges-resume-trading-ripple/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/xrp-up-exchanges-resume-trading-ripple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded</a> massive inflows, with daily trading volume skyrocketing to over $11 billion on July 14 from $600 million on July 13. XRP&#8217;s market price also jumped to $0.95 before traders took profits. The token traded at around $0.74 at press time. </p>



<p>Also, XRP is now crypto&#8217;s fourth largest token behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. XRP&#8217;s market cap boasts $38 billion in USD.</p>

<p>Mantle, a layer 2 network built a-top the Ethereum blockchain, <a href="https://www.mantle.xyz/blog/announcements/mantle-network-mainnet-alpha" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mantle.xyz/blog/announcements/mantle-network-mainnet-alpha" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> its mainnet alpha after developers worked on the chain in a test environment for six months. </p>



<p>Today&#8217;s launch which was announced at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris comes after the protocol reached a merger deal with BitDAO. The agreement signaled two major developments for Mantle &#8211; support from BitDAO&#8217;s $2.4 billion strong treasury and added decentralization through the DAO&#8217;s governance system. </p>



<p>The team tested its modular design in a testnet for over half a year, processing more than 14 million transactions on its blockchain and solving bugs to mitigate future attacks or exploits. The mainnet alpha also passed several security audits, the team added. </p>



<h2>Mantle&#8217;s Modular Masterpiece</h2>



<p>Notably, Mantle&#8217;s blockchain design adopts a modular structure that would section on-chain activities like consensus, data availability, execution, and settlement into separate layers. This design steps away from the monolithic blockchain infrastructure which typically handles operations on a single layer. </p>



<p>The goal, Mantle&#8217;s team said, is to provide users with low-cost transactions and a high-performance network that taps Ethereum&#8217;s security model. Mantle strategic advisor Jordi Alexander noted that the modular approach will also allow the network to implement upgrades and onboard advancements pushed out by Ethereum developers. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As this burgeoning space sizzles on the eve of ‘L2 Summer’, the agility enabled by Mantle Network&#8217;s adaptive and iterative design will keep it at the bleeding edge of the latest technological breakthroughs for years to come</p></blockquote>



<p>Along with its mainnet alpha launch, the Ethereum-compatible L2 network also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bit-up-7-200-million-bitdao-fund-proposal/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bit-up-7-200-million-bitdao-fund-proposal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled a $200 million ecosystem fund approved by BitDAO</a>. According to the announcement, the fund will back early-stage decentralized applications building solutions on the Mantle network. </p>



<p>Several well-known venture firms contributed to the fund including Animoca Ventures, Hashkey Capital, and Pantera Capital. </p>

<p>Cathie Wood’s asset management firm Ark Invest has sold nearly half a million <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-stock-down-9-staking-paused/">Coinbase</a> Global shares worth more than $53 million. The sale comes less than a week after the Ark Innovation ETF sold 135,152 shares of the crypto exchange after the stock rallied amid a series of spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Applications from TradFi giants like BlackRock and Fidelity named Coinbase as its surveillance-sharing partner, leading to an uptick in its share price. </p>



<h2><strong>Ark Invest Bumps Meta and Robinhood Holdings</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/239769/ark-invest-coinbase-sells-cathie-wood" rel="nofollow noopener">The Block</a>, three of Ark Invest’s leading funds were involved in the sale of the Coinbase shares. The Ark Innovation ETF sold 263,247 shares, Ark Next Generation Internet ETF sold 93,227 shares while Ark Fintech Innovation ETF sold 121,882 shares, bringing the total to 478,356 shares. The sale came on the same day when the crypto exchange’s stock rallied to a yearly high of $113. </p>



<p>The rally was prompted by the summary judgment in SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which indicated that XRP did not qualify as a security. The ruling was interpreted as a bullish event by the crypto community and triggered rallies in several crypto tokens and stocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from <a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=COIN&amp;subView=institutional" rel="nofollow noopener">CNN</a> shows that despite the considerable sale earlier, Ark Invest was the second largest holder of Coinbase Global after The Vanguard Group. Among its funds, the asset management firm held a 6.30% stake in the crypto exchange with 11.7 million shares worth a whopping $732.4 million. The asset manager’s trading desk revealed that it had bought more than 82,000 shares of Meta (formerly Facebook) and 169,116 shares of discount brokerage firm Robinhood. </p>

<p>Coinbase’s shares have lost more than 9% of their value following the pausing of its staking services in multiple U.S. states. The pause comes more than a month after ten states initiated <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-cease-desist-order-sec-lawsuit/">proceedings</a> against the crypto exchange on the same day that the Securities and Exchange Commission sued it for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange and offering unregistered securities through its staking service.</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Says It Will Defend Its Staking Services </strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase took to <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1679951143026171905" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share the latest development regarding the staking services with its customers. According to the crypto exchange, which happens to be the largest in the United States, regulators in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin have required it to stop offering its staking product. The state regulators directed the exchange to prevent retail customers from staking additional crypto assets while their proceedings continue. Coinbase has stated that it disagrees with the allegations surrounding its staking services and added that it will vigorously defend the product in court. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We stand by staking. Today almost every major blockchain relies on staking because it is open, secure, and environmentally friendly. Americans in every state deserve access to the same technology and economic opportunities as people everywhere.”</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve safely and legally offered staking for almost 4 years. We’ve  always followed legal process, and will do so here.

</div></figure>



<p>The latest order by state regulators led to a 9% decline in Coinbase’s share price. The stock dropped from its daily high of $113 to as low as $101 before closing at $105. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong previously assured customers that the enforcement action by the SEC and the proceedings initiated by state regulators wouldn’t impact the staking services. “We’re not going to wind down our staking service. Coinbase’s staking product is architected and built in a way to be compliant,” he stated at the time.</p>

<p>Arkham released guidelines for bounty submissions and trading activity on its upcoming Intel Exchange following overwhelming privacy concerns from the crypto community. </p>



<p>On July 10, the blockchain intelligence provider <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-allow-users-buy-sell-intel-wallets/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-allow-users-buy-sell-intel-wallets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a new exchange that will allow users to buy and sell intel on wallet addresses. Arkham described the platform as a place for blockchain sleuths to monetize their skills and a hub for decentralized information sharing. </p>



<h2>Guidelines For Arkham&#8217;s Intel-To-earn Each</h2>



<p>Friday&#8217;s guideline announcement that Arkham&#8217;s Intel Exchange only supports bounties or submissions that request or offer publicly verifiable on-chain data, meaning that trading private off-chain is prohibited on the platform. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Under no circumstances whatsoever will personal physical addresses, phone numbers, confidential ID numbers, date of birth, or other sensitive PII be allowed onto the exchange, even if publicly available elsewhere.</p></blockquote>



<p>The platform&#8217;s rulebook also supports intel that helps to uncover hacks or scam behavior, identifying major players, market movement analysis, and sources of alpha. Also, the platform will support future governance changes to how bounties or submissions are reviewed. </p>

<p>The Intel Exchange was received with contrasting emotions ahead of its launch slated for July 18 along with an airdrop and public token sale of the ARKM coin on Binance. </p>



<p>While some crypto participants saluted the move to create a liquid market for information and allow sleuths like ZachXBT to earn for their work, skeptics voiced doubts about possible privacy breaches and the platform&#8217;s supposed &#8220;dox-to-earn&#8221; model&#8221;. </p>



<p>Community concerns escalated further after it was discovered that private email addresses were viewable when users generated a referral link. </p>



<p>CEO Miguel Morel <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-intel-exchange-offchain/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-intel-exchange-offchain/" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured</a> users during a Twitter space that the company will prioritize safe and public data exchange for the benefit of the participants. </p>

<ul><li>Open Exchange is now offering trading of bankruptcy claims held by customers of FTX and Celsius.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankruptcy claims trading platform is offering immediate liquidity to stranded claims holders.&nbsp;</li><li>OPNX recently partnered with Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange and received a license in Spain.&nbsp;</li><li>OPNX was co-founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the men behind the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Open Exchange (OPNX) is buying bankruptcy claims held by customers of FTX and Celsius Network. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-ecosystem-partner-3ac-ventures/">OPNX</a> rolled out claims for bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and crypto lender Celsius more than a month after it initially announced the feature for its users. The exchange’s native token OX gained more than 3% following the latest development. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.31. </p>



<h2><strong>Open Exchange Partners With Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>Open Exchange took to <a href="https://twitter.com/OPNX_Official/status/1679837501601755139?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to announce that FTX bankruptcy claims were live on its claims trading platform. OPNX encouraged stranded FTX customers to onboard their bankruptcy claims and offered immediate conversion to its native token OX. This token can also be used to trade futures on the crypto exchange. FTX owes roughly $8 billion to its customers, while Celsius owes more than $4 billion. However, it is unlikely that all of these bankruptcy claims will reach OPNX. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“With claim tokenization, we are offering customers immediate liquidity, the chance to regain control over their funds and participate in market opportunities once again,&#8221; </p><cite>Mark Lamb, Founder of Open Exchange</cite></blockquote>



<p>In other news, Open Exchange <a href="https://news.opnx.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> on July 13, 2023, that it had entered into a strategic partnership with Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange, which allowed the exchange to become a licensed entity in Spain. The Cayman Island-registered firm was co-founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the men behind the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. They partnered with CoinFlex co-founders Mark Lamb and Leslie Lamb to launch OPNX earlier this year. </p>

<p>A court has <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.601957/gov.uscourts.nysd.601957.5.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.601957/gov.uscourts.nysd.601957.5.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">agreed to release Alex Mashinsky</a> on $40 million bail after the former Celsius CEO was indicted and arrested by the Department of Justice on Thursday. The DOJ charged Mashinsky on seven counts including securities fraud and market manipulation. </p>



<p>Mashinsky&#8217;s personal recognizance bond must be signed by two financially responsible persons. The first, his wife, must sign the $40 million bail agreement by today July 14. The court set a deadline of July 21 for the second FRP&#8217;s signature. </p>



<p>This bail agreement is usually issued to individuals with close ties to their community. The personal recognizance bond also considers the defendants&#8217; criminal records, whether they are a flight risk, and their employment status among other factors. </p>



<p>A personal recognizance bond means that Mashinsky will be released without actually paying any money for his bail and will be required to attend all court hearings linked to his fraud case.</p>



<h2>Celsius Boss Dismisses Criminal Charges </h2>



<p>On July 13, the DOJ<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-celsius-founder-alex-mashinksy/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-celsius-founder-alex-mashinksy/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> arrested Mashinsky</a> and filed criminal charges against the former Celsius CEO for allegedly committing securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and manipulating the price of CEL, his company&#8217;s native token. </p>



<p>The SEC and previously the CFTC also accused Mashinsky of falsely marketing Celsius as a path to financial freedom while he and other executives used customer funds to make risky investments, fund personal expenses, and raise billions of dollars through unregistered offerings. </p>



<p>&#8220;He looks forward to vigorously defending himself in court against these baseless charges,” Mashinsky’s lawyer Jonathan Ohring said on behalf of the Celsius founder who <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/ex-celsius-ceo-mashinsky-arrested-in-latest-doj-crypto-case-1" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/ex-celsius-ceo-mashinsky-arrested-in-latest-doj-crypto-case-1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">denied</a> all the allegations against him.</p>
