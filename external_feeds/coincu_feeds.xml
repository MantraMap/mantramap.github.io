<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ripple Labs&#8217; attorney, Lisa R. Zornberg, requests withdrawal from the SEC lawsuit following Judge&#8217;s ruling.</em></li>



<li><em>Magistrate Judge urges settlement talks between the company and SEC on key lawsuit issues.</em></li>



<li><em>XRP price surges as legal developments unfold, sparking optimism for its non-security status.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Ripple lawsuit, the prominent attorney representing Ripple Labs and its CEO, <a href="https://coincu.com/205247-ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-blames-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brad Garlinghouse</a>, has formally <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.880.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requested</a> to withdraw from the case.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2160.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2160.png" alt="Ripple Lawsuit Unravels: Prominent Attorney To Withdrawal Amidst Settlement Talks" class="wp-image-206907" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2160.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2160-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2160-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2160-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Ripple Lawsuit Unravels: Prominent Attorney To Withdrawal Amidst Settlement Talks 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>This request was made following Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; landmark ruling in the ongoing legal battle. Furthermore, Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn has urged both <a href="https://coincu.com/203303-ripple-to-initiate-talks-with-us-financial-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a> and the SEC to explore a potential settlement on other aspects of the lawsuit.</p>



<p>As per the filing in the District Court For the Southern District of New York on July 27, Ripple submitted a motion for Lisa R. Zornberg of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP to withdraw as attorney for the defendants. The company cited that Lisa R. Zornberg will no longer be associated with the law firm effective from July 31.</p>



<p>Despite this withdrawal, Ripple maintains that the interests of the defendants, including Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, will not be adversely affected. The legal representation for Ripple Labs in the lawsuit will continue with other attorneys from Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2162-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2162-1024x683.png" alt="Ripple Lawsuit Unravels: Prominent Attorney To Withdrawal Amidst Settlement Talks" class="wp-image-206909" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2162-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2162-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2162-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2162-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2162-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2162.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ripple Lawsuit Unravels: Prominent Attorney To Withdrawal Amidst Settlement Talks 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brad Garlinghouse</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another attorney, Anna R. Gressel, also filed a motion to withdraw as an attorney for Ripple Labs on July 12. Ripple similarly requested the court to grant Anna R. Gressel of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP the withdrawal, as she is no longer associated with the law firm effective as of July 12.</p>



<p>The case has seen additional changes in legal representation, with the court approving withdrawal motions for attorneys Clayton J. Masterman and Kylie Chiseul Kim, who have also exited from the lawsuit.</p>



<p>In response to the recent ruling and disclosure of Ripple&#8217;s future plans, the price of <a href="https://coincu.com/203962-ripple-jumps-over-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP</a> experienced a surge. Notably, XRP holder and lawyer, John E. Deaton, emphasized that even if SEC Chair <a href="https://coincu.com/203493-gary-gensler-feeling-disappointed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler</a> <a href="https://coincu.com/204894-us-sec-signals-appeal-court-ripple-xrp-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeks</a> an appeal, XRP will likely retain its classification as a non-security for at least two years. This prediction is based on the complexities the SEC may face in altering its stance on the matter.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2163.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="980" height="653" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2163.png" alt="Ripple Lawsuit Unravels: Prominent Attorney To Withdrawal Amidst Settlement Talks" class="wp-image-206910" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2163.png 980w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2163-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2163-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2163-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" title="Ripple Lawsuit Unravels: Prominent Attorney To Withdrawal Amidst Settlement Talks 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gary Gensler</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In light of the ongoing developments and changing legal landscape, Judge Analisa Torres has entrusted Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn with the responsibility of overseeing the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit. Magistrate Judge Netburn has directed both parties to negotiate and agree on three mutually convenient dates to schedule a settlement conference. This conference aims to address pertinent issues, including the institutional sales of XRP, and explore the possibility of resolving the case outside of court.</p>



<p>Amidst these legal proceedings, it is worth mentioning that Lisa R. Zornberg, the attorney seeking withdrawal from the Ripple case, was appointed as City Hall Chief Counsel by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week, signifying her transition to a new role within the city&#8217;s administration.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>ParaSpace to launch zkSync network, supporting ETH, USDC, and WBTC for NFT lending.</em></li>



<li><em>Platform swiftly resolves asset liquidation issues, reimbursing affected users.</em></li>



<li><em>Exciting upgrades in Version 2.0 promise enhanced user experience in DeFi lending.</em></li>
</ul>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153-1024x682.png" alt="ParaSpace Boosts New Support For NFT Lending With zkSync Integration" class="wp-image-206885" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2153-1140x760.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ParaSpace Boosts New Support For NFT Lending With zkSync Integration 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>With this integration, ParaSpace will support three major cryptocurrencies: ETH, USDC, and WBTC, expanding its reach and offering even more options to its users.</p>



<p>In addition to the zkSync network launch, ParaSpace has implemented four vital features, namely &#8220;Supply,&#8221; &#8220;Withdraw,&#8221; &#8220;Borrow,&#8221; and &#8220;Repay.&#8221; These features are designed to bolster the overall experience on the platform, providing users with more flexibility and control over their assets.</p>



<p>As a fully decentralized and permissionless protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, ParaSpace has already gained popularity for its support of a wide range of fungible tokens, including BTC, ETH, DAI, USDC, and APE, along with various blue chip NFT collections.

<p>The<a href="https://www.justice.gov/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.justice.gov/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DOJ</a> has accused Bankman-Fried of leaking Caroline Ellison&#8217;s private diary to The New York Times and trying to tamper with witnesses multiple times.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried has requested the court to seal the private diary of Caroline Ellison, his ex-girlfriend and ex-Alameda Research CEO. In response, Inner City Press has opposed the move, according to court filings. Judge Kaplan has declined to jail Bankman-Fried immediately, but has imposed a temporary gag order on parties and witnesses to avoid public dissemination or discussion of the case, which could interfere with a fair trial. Judge Kaplan has also set out a rapid schedule for both the prosecution and the defense to make formal written submissions on the matter.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyer has written to the court, &#8220;The presumption of access to these documents is greatly outweighed by the need to avoid their public dissemination at this time.&#8221; A publication that covers court proceedings in New York&#8217;s federal court, Inner City Press, has previously opposed Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bid to keep secret the identity of his bail co-signers and asked the court to schedule a hearing on the matter if required.</p>



<p>Inner City&#8217;s Matthew Russell Lee wrote to the court opposing the sealing of documents Bankman-Fried already provided to The New York Times, stating, &#8220;Again this defendant is being treated differently than other defendants in this District. This is an application for this court to grant or, if necessary, schedule a hearing on this challenge to the proposed withholding of this information.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.182.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court case</a> has taken an unexpected turn, with <a href="https://coincu.com/206346-prosecutors-want-sam-bankman-fried-in-jail-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> seeking to seal <a href="https://coincu.com/204571-former-alameda-co-ceo-admits-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ellison</a>&#8216;s private diary, a move that Inner City Press, a publication covering court proceedings, has opposed.</p>



<p>The situation has intensified due to the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s (DOJ) request for Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York to have Bankman-Fried remanded to jail before his criminal trial. The DOJ accuses SBF of leaking Ellison&#8217;s diary to <em>The New York Times</em> and tampering with witnesses on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyer, however, has argued that public dissemination of the private diary should be avoided at this time. The attorney asserts that the presumption of access to the documents should be outweighed by the need for privacy.</p>



<p>During a court hearing, Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon emphasized that the leaked diary entries, combined with Bankman-Fried&#8217;s prior interactions with FTX&#8217;s general counsel, constituted witness tampering. Sassoon contended that no set of release conditions could guarantee community safety.</p>



<p>In response to the escalating situation, Judge Kaplan issued a temporary gag order, restricting SBF, his legal team, and representatives from discussing the case publicly. The judge also announced that further filings from both the prosecution and defense would be accepted over the next week. Kaplan will then decide whether to revoke Bankman-Fried&#8217;s current bond conditions, which permit him to remain under house arrest until his scheduled criminal trial in October.</p>

<p>Inner City Press, known for its involvement in court matters, has previously opposed Bankman-Fried&#8217;s efforts to keep the identity of his bail co-signers confidential. The publication has requested a hearing if necessary.</p>



<p>The legal battle continues to intensify as the FTX founder faces a two-part trial in October and next March, encompassing charges of securities and wire fraud, as well as bank fraud and bribery allegations. Bankman-Fried maintains his plea of not guilty throughout the proceedings.</p>



<p>In a recent development, US prosecutors <a href="https://coincu.com/206349-bankman-fried-innocence-unlawful-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped</a> the charge of unlawful campaign contributions against Samuel Bankman-Fried. The charge was not included in the extradition agreement between the US and the Bahamas. However, SBF is still slated to face trial in October on 12 other charges, including allegations of running a years-long fraud at FTX.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SlowMist has recently brought to light a shocking revelation that exposes a false deposit attack that has remained concealed within centralized exchanges (CEXs) for an extended period.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="976" height="716" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141.png" alt="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs" class="wp-image-206841" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141.png 976w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141-300x220.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141-768x563.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141-750x550.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" title="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p> The attack exploited vulnerabilities in the exchange&#8217;s transaction processing mechanism.</p>



<p><a href="https://slowmist.medium.com/how-does-the-false-top-up-attack-break-through-the-defense-of-the-exchange-d6e8ebb434f5" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://slowmist.medium.com/how-does-the-false-top-up-attack-break-through-the-defense-of-the-exchange-d6e8ebb434f5" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to SlowMist&#8217;s detailed analysis</a>, the attacker executed the false deposit attack by sending forged transaction data to the exchange&#8217;s designated wallet address. Tragically, the exchange&#8217;s system erroneously perceived the malicious transaction as a legitimate deposit request and credited the corresponding digital assets directly into the attacker&#8217;s account.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="918" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-1024x918.png" alt="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs" class="wp-image-206842" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-1024x918.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-300x269.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-768x689.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-750x672.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-1140x1022.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142.png 1314w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This sophisticated attack method enabled the attacker to accumulate a substantial amount of digital assets over time, taking advantage of the loophole in the exchange&#8217;s security protocols. SlowMist&#8217;s disclosure of this previously hidden attack has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, raising concerns about the vulnerabilities present in some CEXs.</p>



<p>False deposit attacks pose significant risks to exchanges and their users. The seamless execution of such attacks raises questions about the efficacy of existing security measures employed by CEXs to safeguard user assets.</p>



<p>The revelation has sparked discussions among industry experts and stakeholders about the need for enhanced security measures and robust transaction verification protocols within centralized exchange platforms. Ensuring the integrity and accuracy of deposit processing is paramount to protect users from potential financial losses.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143.png" alt="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs" class="wp-image-206843" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143.png 400w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143-300x300.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143-150x150.png 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143-75x75.png 75w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143-350x350.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" title="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While SlowMist&#8217;s disclosure has shed light on this particular false deposit attack, it also underscores the importance of constant vigilance and thorough security audits within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the industry continues to evolve, addressing vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors becomes a shared responsibility among exchanges, security companies, and users alike.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Phoenix Technology, a UAE-based cryptocurrency mining hardware retailer, is in preliminary discussions for a potential IPO in Abu Dhabi.</em></li>



<li><em>The company is developing one of the largest mining facilities in the Middle East with a $2 billion crypto-mining farm project.</em></li>



<li><em>UAE&#8217;s crypto-friendly policies and growing interest in blockchain technology make it an attractive hub for the industry</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Phoenix Technology, a leading cryptocurrency mining hardware retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, is reportedly in the early stages of considering an initial public offering (IPO) in its home country, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/crypto-hardware-retailer-phoenix-said-in-early-talks-for-uae-ipo#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-1024x683.png" alt="Phoenix Technology Explores Prospects With Potential UAE IPO" class="wp-image-206829" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Phoenix Technology Explores Prospects With Potential UAE IPO 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to insiders familiar with the matter, the company is contemplating a listing on the stock exchange in Abu Dhabi as early as this year.</p>



<p>The firm is known for its ambitious project to create one of the largest mining facilities in the entire Middle East. While specific details of the IPO, such as the exact timing and size, are still fluid and subject to change, the potential move signals Phoenix Technology&#8217;s desire to capitalize on the growing interest in cryptocurrencies and the blockchain industry.</p>



<p>The United Arab Emirates, particularly Dubai, has been proactively positioning itself as a welcoming hub for the crypto sector, drawing in major players like <a href="https://coincu.com/206699-binance-accuses-cftc-overruling-stop-the-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/206150-okx-wallet-worldcoin-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OKX</a>, and <a href="https://coincu.com/197893-bybit-now-secures-license-to-cyprus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bybit</a>. This appeal has been boosted by the country&#8217;s friendly policies and supportive stance on cryptocurrencies. However, recent reports indicate that the UAE is now taking steps to tighten scrutiny of crypto license applicants to ensure proper oversight, especially in the wake of prominent scandals within the industry.</p>



<p>Phoenix Technology&#8217;s establishment in 2015 has seen impressive growth, with operations spanning across the US, Canada, Europe, and the Middle East, totaling more than 700 megawatts. The company&#8217;s latest and most ambitious venture is the development of a massive $2 billion crypto-mining farm within the UAE, aiming to become the largest mining site in the region.</p>



<p>Additionally, Phoenix Technology last year announced a strategic and exclusive regional partnership agreement with MicroBT, a blockchain technology company, to distribute their acclaimed WhatsMiner brand in the GCC countries, Egypt, and Turkey markets.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="770" height="440" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140.png" alt="Phoenix Technology Explores Prospects With Potential UAE IPO" class="wp-image-206832" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140.png 770w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140-300x171.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140-768x439.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140-750x429.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" title="Phoenix Technology Explores Prospects With Potential UAE IPO 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>The potential IPO in Abu Dhabi comes at a pivotal moment for the global cryptocurrency industry, where market interest and regulatory scrutiny are at an all-time high. Phoenix Technology&#8217;s move to go public could not only bolster its financial standing but also contribute to further cementing the UAE&#8217;s position as a major player in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape. However, as with any financial endeavor, the success of the IPO will depend on market conditions and regulatory developments.</p>



<p>As of now, the company has not released any official statements regarding the IPO discussions. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency community and investors will undoubtedly be keeping a close eye on Phoenix Technology&#8217;s next moves, as they could have significant implications for the future of the UAE&#8217;s role in the rapidly expanding crypto space.</p>

<p>Sui development company Mysten Labs had introduced Bullshark Quests, a novel way for Bullshark holders to earn SUI rewards.

<p>Bullshark Quests have emerged as an exciting platform for users to actively participate in the SUI ecosystem and be rewarded for their contributions. As the crypto community continues to explore innovative ways to engage users, Bullshark Quests have proven to be a compelling and rewarding experience for participants.</p>
