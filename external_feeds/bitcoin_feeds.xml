Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) has explained that President Joe Biden is &#8220;preparing for a ground war with Russia&#8221; by signing an ex</strong><strong>ecutive order to mobilize reserve forces to augment Operation Atlantic Resolve. Multiple people have accused Biden of starting World War III.</strong></p>
<h2>Biden Preparing for Ground War With Russia, Says Kennedy Jr.</h2>
<p>U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) has slammed President Joe Biden over his executive order to mobilize select reserve forces in order to augment Operation Atlantic Resolve. Kennedy is a son of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Operation Atlantic Resolve was launched in 2014 following Russia&#8217;s invasion of the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Kennedy tweeted Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Biden just called up 3,000 reservists to augment U.S. troops in Europe as part of ‘Operation Atlantic Resolve.’ I want people to understand what this troop mobilization is about. It&#8217;s about preparing for a ground war with Russia.</p></blockquote>
<p>Retired Army SFC Sergeant Schultz <a href="https://twitter.com/oldschoolethos/status/1679850168189870080">explained</a> Friday: &#8220;The IRR (Individual Ready Reserve), for all intents and purposes, are full-on civilians &#8230; They aren’t issued gear, a lot no longer maintain physical weight standards or appearances, and most don’t update contact information ever because they don’t want to be contacted by &#8216;Career Counselors.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>In follow-up tweets, Kennedy stressed that while Biden is building global military dominance, “our cities decay, our infrastructure falls apart, our middle class hollows out, crime soars, chronic disease and addiction run rampant. We can heal all of this if we try. But not if we pour our resources into foreign adventures.”</p>
<p>The presidential hopeful added: “Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian youth have already died because America&#8217;s foreign policy establishment manipulated their country into war to fulfill vain + futile geopolitical fantasy. Now, rather than acknowledge failure, Biden admin prepares to sacrifice American lives too.”</p>

<h2>Warnings of World War 3</h2>
<p>Kennedy&#8217;s remarks emerged amidst heightened concerns about the possibility of World War III. Critics have accused Biden of wanting to start World War III after he issued the executive order on Thursday, authorizing the deployment of some U.S. reservists to Europe.</p>
<p>Attorney Jenna Ellis, who was a member of former U.S. President Donald Trump&#8217;s legal team, tweeted: &#8220;WW3 is coming.&#8221; Military veteran Larry Dean Jones Jr. wrote on Twitter: &#8220;Operation Atlantic Resolve refers to military activities responding to Russian operations in Ukraine. In other words, Biden is getting us into war and eventually WW3!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia&#8217;s Security Council chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-medvedev-natos-military-aid-ukraine-brings-world-war-three-closer-2023-07-11/">cautioned</a> on Tuesday that the increase in <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_217059.htm">military assistance</a> to Ukraine by the NATO alliance brings World War III closer. He wrote on Telegram:</p>
<blockquote><p>The completely crazy West could not come up with anything else &#8230; World War Three is getting closer.</p></blockquote>

Noting that the USD &#8220;will die,&#8221; he urged investors to buy gold, silver, and bitcoin. His warnings came as the BRICS economic bloc is discussing creating a common currency that could be backed by gold.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki’s Giant Crash Warnings</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has issued more warnings about the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Giant crash coming. Fake money, aka fiat currency, to die. BRICS meeting in S. Africa [on] August 22 to put nail in coffin of fiat…fake money. Get into real gold, silver &amp; bitcoin asap. Take care. End of fiat (fake) money near.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, Kiyosaki <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-us-dollar-will-die-citing-brics-nations-plan-to-launch-gold-backed-currency/">specifically warned</a> about the end of the U.S. dollar, citing reports that the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are preparing to launch a common currency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">backed by gold</a>. Stating that the U.S. dollar &#8220;will die,&#8221; the renowned author noted that trillions of USD will &#8220;rush home&#8221; and inflation will go through the roof. He also stated that the price of bitcoin will reach $120K next year.</p>
<p>The famous author has persistently cautioned about the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-end-of-fake-money-is-here-shares-3-lessons-to-help-investors-amid-market-crashes/">downfall</a> of the U.S. dollar, referring to it as &#8220;fake&#8221; money. In contrast, he has consistently expressed his belief that gold and silver are &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-500k-by-2025-and-gold-soaring-to-5k/">God&#8217;s money</a>,&#8221; while bitcoin represents &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-he-likes-bitcoin-calls-btc-peoples-money/">people&#8217;s money</a>.&#8221; According to him, these three investments are the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">most suitable choices</a> for &#8220;unstable times.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a follow-up tweet on Friday, Kiyosaki explained the recent surge in the stock market. He wrote: &#8220;Why is stock market taking off? Because &#8216;debt ceiling&#8217; removed. Means national debt to rise with stock market. Rich get richer as America gets poorer. Sad. Sticking with real money &amp; real assets: gold, silver, bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The famous author has been sounding the alarm about a giant crash for quite some time. In June, he warned of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-warns-of-greatest-real-estate-crash-ever/">greatest real estate crash</a> &#8220;ever.&#8221; He also believes that the U.S. economy is headed for a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-us-economy-headed-for-crash-landing-financial-pandemic-started-corruption-high/">crash landing</a>. In February, he cautioned that &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-warns-everything-will-crash-plans-to-buy-more-bitcoin/">everything will crash</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rich Dad Poor Dad author is not alone in foreseeing a significant crash on the horizon. Veteran trader Jim Rogers anticipates the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-of-the-worst-recession-in-his-lifetime/">most severe recession</a> and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-expects-worst-bear-market-in-his-lifetime-says-you-should-be-extremely-worried/">worst bear market</a> in his lifetime. Economist Peter Schiff issued warnings in May about potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-says-nobodys-money-is-safe-in-any-bank-warns-of-financial-crises-depressions/">financial crises and depressions</a>.</p>

<h2>US Lawmakers Call on Congress to Pass Crypto Bills Following SEC v Ripple Ruling</h2>
<p>Following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">ruling </a>on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, a number of U.S. lawmakers have called on Congress to pass legislation to regulate crypto and uphold the court ruling.</p>
<p>The chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry (R-NC), and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Glenn &#x201C;GT&#x201D; Thompson (R-PA), issued a joint statement on Friday regarding the SEC v. Ripple case ruling and the need for legislative clarity in the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This decision underscores the need for Congress to provide clear rules of the road for the digital asset ecosystem &#x2014; it&#x2019;s misguided to think otherwise. The ruling gives large institutional investors greater protections than everyday Americans. Outcomes like this are what happens when regulators force courts to make policy instead of Congress,&#x201D; the lawmakers said. They proceeded to urge Congress to pass a bill they introduced that focuses on market structure legislation. &#x201C;Our comprehensive market structure legislation will give all investors, customers, and market participants the same longstanding protections found in traditional financial markets,&#x201D; the lawmakers stressed, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision also recognizes what Republicans have said all along: there is a limit to the SEC&#x2019;s reach. According to the court, digital assets may not be inherently securities, but can be offered as part of an investment contract in certain circumstances, which our legislation acknowledges.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Gary Gensler&#x2019;s SEC cannot continue to pursue its regulation by enforcement approach, which only harms investors and creates uncertainty,&#x201D; they added. The lawmakers have repeatedly criticized the SEC chairman for regulating the crypto industry by enforcement. There is also a bill in Congress to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-introducing-legislation-to-remove-sec-chairman-due-to-long-series-of-abuses/">remove</a> him as the chair of the securities regulator. Moreover, Gensler has said that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, other than bitcoin, are securities.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our digital asset market structure bill is essential to filling the regulatory gaps highlighted in this decision. We remain committed to ensuring all Americans have robust protections in the digital asset marketplace. We look forward to advancing this legislation out of our respective committees this month,&#x201D; McHenry and Thompson concluded.</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) similarly urged Congress to expedite the passage of the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act. On Friday, she tweeted her statement in response to the ruling. &#x201C;I applaud the decision of the Southern District of New York finding that crypto assets traded in secondary markets may not be investment contracts. This is the position that section 501 of the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act has taken from the beginning,&#x201D; her statement reads. The senator added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision confirms the need for Congress to deliver a clear regulatory structure for the crypto asset industry that provides the highest level of consumer protection. We need to pass Lummis-Gillibrand to uphold the Howey test as interpreted by the Southern District of New York.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act was <a href="https://www.lummis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Lummis-Gillibrand-2023-Section-by-Section-Final.pdf">recently revised</a>. The bill was first introduced in June last year. Lummis reintroduced it in the Senate on July 12.</p>
<p>Congressman Tom Emmer tweeted on Thursday: &#x201C;The Ripple case is a monumental development in establishing that a token is separate and distinct from an investment contract it may or may not be part of. Now, let&#x2019;s make it law.&#x201D;</p>

The news, which comes as the coin trading platform marks its sixth anniversary amid increased pressure from regulators, was termed as FUD by founder Changpeng Zhao who said his company is still hiring. </strong></p>
<h2>Major Digital Asset Exchange Binance Cutting Jobs Amid U.S. Regulatory Crackdown, Report</h2>
<p>Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, is reducing its workforce after several executives left the company. Media reports about the layoffs come against the backdrop of an ongoing clampdown on the industry and the trading platform in the U.S. where it’s involved in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">lawsuits</a> with the securities and futures commissions and is under investigation by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Binance had laid off more than 1,000 employees in recent weeks. A source familiar with the matter later confirmed to Reuters that the crypto behemoth has been cutting jobs. The reports come just days after it became clear that several execs are leaving the digital assets platform with the largest daily trading volume.</p>
<p>Just like when he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cz-says-news-of-exec-departures-at-binance-is-fud/">reacted</a> to the executive exodus, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao described the news of massive layoffs as FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). In a tweet, he stated that the reported numbers “are all way off” and insisted that the company is still hiring.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As we continuously strive to increase talent density, there are involuntary terminations. This happens in every company. The numbers reported by media are all way off. 4 FUD.</p>
<p>On the bright side, they just can’t resist talking about us.</p>
<p>We are still hiring. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>— CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1679951762906595330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>At the end of May, CZ <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-on-layoffs-rumors-another-day-another-fud/">refuted</a> rumors suggesting that up to a fifth of the exchange’s workforce might have to leave due to poor market conditions. Last week, he pointed out that his organization has grown from 30 to 8,000 people in just six years.</p>
<p>“As Binance celebrates our sixth anniversary, I want to thank everyone in our community for your extraordinary support. Binance would not be here without you,” CZ said in a video statement on July 14. “We can’t wait for what lies ahead,” the exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1679737700897947648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>

<p>Also on Friday, CNBC reported that Binance intends to lay off between 1,500 and 3,000 people globally through the end of the year, including the 1,000 already let go as per WSJ’s report, in response to an ongoing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-reportedly-investigated-in-us-for-russia-sanctions-violations/">probe</a> by the U.S. Justice Department over suspected money laundering violations and sanctions evasion.</p>
<p>The report quoted a “current employee familiar with the company’s plans” who asked to remain anonymous but also noted that a  representative disputed the higher number. “As we prepare for the next major bull cycle, it has become clear that we need to focus on talent density across the organization to ensure we remain nimble and dynamic. This is not a case of rightsizing, but rather, re-evaluating whether we have the right talent and expertise in critical roles,” the spokesperson said.</p>

<h2>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Lawyers Advocate for Security-Free Visits for a Secret Group of &#8216;Close Friends&#8217;</h2>
<p>Christian Everdell, legal counsel for Sam Bankman-Fried, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.174.0_3.pdf">presented</a> a letter to the court advocating that &#8220;close friends and colleagues&#8221; as well as &#8220;household help&#8221; be permitted to call on his client without undergoing a security screening.</p>
<p>This request arises from the bail stipulations determined on March 28, 2023, which mandate a security guard to vet every visitor to Bankman-Fried’s parents’ dwelling, further requiring them to sign into an electronic log book.</p>
<p>The appeal seeks an exemption for a select roster of friends and colleagues from these protocols, a list that remains under wraps at present. “We further request that the attached list of people be filed under seal,” reads the counsel&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>The letter further asserts that this collective will &#8220;abide by Mr. Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bail conditions.&#8221; One such condition restricts guests from carrying items like smartphones, tablets, and any internet-connected apparatus during their visits to Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p>Though the correspondence affirms that the &#8220;government consents to this request,&#8221; Inner City Press, a news outlet focused on high-profile court cases, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/86066063">objects</a> to the concealment of names provided to the court.</p>
<p>Inner City Press&#8217;s executive director, Matthew Lee, says the legal paperwork &#8220;should be unsealed.&#8221; Initially, the court had obscured the identities of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bond surety signers, but later disclosed them to the public in response to objections against the redaction.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal team opposes the release of the list of close friends that the FTX founder has invited to visit without security. “The individuals’ privacy and safety interests greatly outweigh any presumption of access to the list and justify protecting their identities from public disclosure,” Everdell concludes in the letter to U.S. judge Lewis Kaplan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you agree with Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal team&#8217;s quest for confidentiality in this case? Should close friends be permitted to visit without security checks, or does this undermine the purpose of the established bail conditions? Share your thoughts and opinions about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

At that time, the public witnessed the second, third, and fourth largest bank failures in U.S. history. Dimon asserted that “for the most part,” the financial crisis of 2023 is over. He downplayed its severity, dubbing it a &#8220;mini-crisis&#8221; and stating it was &#8220;nothing like 2008 or 2009.&#8221; </strong></p>
<h2>Dimon: ‘I Think the Odds of Rates Going Higher From Here Are Higher Than What Other People Think’</h2>
<p>Jamie Dimon, the lead executive at JPMorgan Chase, <a href="https://youtu.be/BU76qx8Xpcw">shared his insights</a> on a myriad of topics including the March 2023 U.S. banking turmoil, soaring interest rates, fluctuating consumer savings, and the escalating conflict in Ukraine. The Economist probed Dimon about his perspective on whether the 2023 banking crisis was truly behind us, to which he replied, it was “for the most part.”</p>
<p>Dimon categorically labeled the banking calamity as a “mini-crisis,” insisting that it paled in comparison to the catastrophic events of &#8220;2008 or 2009&#8221; when the system was buckling under the pressure of excessive leverage. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t too much leverage this time, there&#8217;s plenty of capital, we had a trillion dollars in mortgage problems last time.” With regard to the recent incident, the JPMorgan chief highlighted that certain banks suffered from interest rate exposure and witnessed “uninsured deposits that kind of ran like a flock of birds.”</p>
<p>Dimon proposed his belief that rates have the potential to “go up from here and they might rear it&#8217;s ugly head again.” He expressed hope that banks, along with other financial institutions, are braced for this potential upheaval. “I think the odds of rates going higher from here are higher than what other people think,” he emphasized, speaking about the federal funds rate. “We&#8217;ve never had quantitative tightening before, I think the effects on that in the market may be more serious than other people think.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dimon conveyed that JPMorgan foresees American consumers exhausting their pandemic savings by the close of the year. “Consumers have money, they have a trillion dollars more in their checking accounts, and it&#8217;s been coming down and we think sometime around the end of the year … that excess money will be spent,” he predicted. Despite this not being the most welcome news, Dimon is not overly apprehensive about a recession.</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s possible you know, [a recession] and it could be very mild, it could be a soft landing, and it could be a hard landing,” Dimon mused. “I&#8217;m much more worried about some of these other serious things getting worse, the war in Ukraine spreading out, nuclear blackmail, you know if food doesn&#8217;t get delivered there’s starvation in Africa … I&#8217;m far more worried about that.” While Dimon acknowledged the potential for these concerns to subside, he cautioned against outright expecting this to happen.</p>

However, what does this mean for price action for the remainder of the month? </strong></p>
<h2>Current Market Status</h2>
<p>Prior to Thursday, cryptocurrency markets mostly consolidated to start the month, as traders digested various data points from the United States.</p>
<p>Firstly, non-farm payrolls fell below expectations, coming in at 205,000, then inflation also slipped, dropping to a two-year low of 3.0%.</p>
<p>Despite this, traders still struggled to define market sentiment, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> unable to break out of a ceiling at $31,000, until this week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2>July Outlook</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) surged to an intraday peak of $31,862 on Thursday, which was its strongest level since May 2022.</p>
<p>The move came following a breakout of a resistance level at $31,400, however, bulls have so far been unable to sustain this.</p>
<p>As of writing this, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is trading at $30,342.71, after briefly falling below $30,000 during Saturday&#x2019;s session.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the price has since stabilized, as the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 weeks, fell to a floor at 61.00.</p>
<p>Should this floor hold, bitcoin bulls will likely continue to target a breakout above the next key ceiling, which lay at $32,400.</p>

The global crypto market cap was mostly lower, falling by over 2% as traders began to secure recent gains. Despite this, dogecoin also rose, hitting a two-month high in today’s session.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) rose by as much as 7% to start the weekend, despite the wider cryptocurrency market mostly moving lower.</p>
<p>SHIB/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.000008484 on Saturday, a day after trading at a low of $0.000007705.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#8217;s high, the meme coin rose to its strongest point since June 5, when the price was trading at $0.00000867.</p>

<p>The move took place as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at the 62.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is now at 64.00, with an upcoming resistance point of 68.00 a possible destination for bulls.</p>
<p>There is a good chance that SHIB will be trading at $0.00000900, in the event the bulls reach their target.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Another notable gainer to start the weekend was dogecoin (DOGE), which also cemented a multi-month high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.0672 on Friday, DOGE/USD jumped 5% higher on Saturday, hitting a peak of $0.07471 in the process.</p>
<p>This resulted in the meme coin trading at its highest level since May 8, which is the last time price was above $0.0770.</p>

<p>Earlier gains have somewhat faded, as traders leave earlier positions, as a result of the RSI colliding with a ceiling at 66.00.</p>
<p>The meme coin is now trading at $0.07351, however overall sentiment for the weekend could remain bullish, should it move past the 66.00 point.</p>

Data reveals that Lido Finance dominates the market, commanding a 74% share of the liquid staked ether sector.</strong></p>
<h2>Influx of 1.5 Million Ether Bolsters Liquid Staking Derivatives Platforms</h2>
<p>In a span of barely more than two months, the liquid staking derivatives sector witnessed a substantial swelling of nearly $3 billion in its value. <a href="https://archive.li/HiKgM">Historical data</a> from defillama.com, dated May 12, 2023, illustrates that an estimated 8.87 million ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) was held in liquid staking platforms. As of today, that number has ascended to a noteworthy <a href="https://archive.li/PMd2T">10.38 million ETH</a>. Essentially, in the preceding 63-day window, there was an injection of 1.50 million ether, which translates to a monetary equivalent of approximately $2.96 billion, based on current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> exchange rates.</p>

<p>In the last week, the total value locked (TVL) in the liquid staking protocol Lido Finance has seen a marginal increase of 1.80%, and over the previous month, the TVL experienced a more significant jump of 7.29%. Of the 10.38 million ether distributed among 23 decentralized finance (defi) platforms, Lido retains an overwhelming 7.71 million ether, which makes up 74.33% of the total. Based on current exchange rates, Lido&#x2019;s TVL is valued approximately at $15.406 billion. Following Lido, Coinbase&#x2019;s Wrapped Ether protocol holds the second largest TVL, containing a substantial 1.14 million ether, currently valued at around $2.37 billion.</p>
<p>Data from May 12 suggests that Coinbase&#x2019;s holdings were approximately 1.14 million ether, a figure that has seen little change to date. Conversely, Lido experienced a significant influx of about 1,113,098 ether added to its total value locked (TVL) in the 63-day period. This implies that since May 12, an estimated 394,187 ether was introduced into other liquid staking derivatives platforms excluding Lido and Coinbase. From this reported sum, Rocket Pool received a deposit of 207,406 ether. The Frax Ether protocol was the beneficiary of roughly 50,646 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, and Stakewise saw a modest increase with about 3,464 ether added.</p>

<p>On May 12, Binance&#x2019;s Staked Ether protocol held 20,371 ether, a figure that has since surged to 91,834 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> today. This signifies that during the past 63 days, a substantial 71,463 ether has been contributed to Binance&#x2019;s Staked Ether protocol. Binance&#x2019;s liquid staking derivatives platform ascended from being the ninth-largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> holder to the sixth-largest among the 23 liquid staking platforms. Monthly statistics reveal the platform experienced a 28.06% rise, but 26.46% of that growth occurred over the previous week. At present, the quantity of ether confined in liquid staking platforms constitutes 8.63% of the total circulating supply issued by the Ethereum network since its inception.</p>

The decline saw the price fall below $30,000, days after almost moving above $32,000. Ethereum also slipped, however remained above $1,900.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) fell below $30,000 to start the weekend, as traders began to take profits, following recent highs.</p>
<p>After peaking at $31,354.48 on Saturday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD plunged to an intraday low of $29,966.39 earlier today.</p>
<p>This sees bitcoin retreat from a high of $31,862, which was the strongest level for the cryptocurrency since last May.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the decline was somewhat inevitable, due to the relative strength (RSI) moving into overbought territory.</p>
<p>The index rose to a peak of 65.55 on Thursday, before falling to a current reading of 54.17 earlier today.</p>
<p>Since this drop, price strength has since stabilized, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> now trading at $30,347.59.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved lower on Saturday, however traders were able to reject a drop below the $1,900 level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $1,901.36 earlier in the day, less than 24-hours after trading at a top of $2,005.96.</p>
<p>Since hitting Friday&#x2019;s three-month high, bulls have opted to abandon previous positions heading into the weekend.</p>

<p>The world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency has since rebounded, bouncing away from a floor at $1,900, and now trades at $1,943.27.</p>
<p>This comes as the RSI held firm at a support point around the 55.00 zone, going on to climb to a current reading of 56.79.</p>
<p>Overall, the next target could be around the 61.00 mark, and if successfully hit, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will likely be back over $2,000.</p>
