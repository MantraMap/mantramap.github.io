            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Robert Kiyosaki &#8211; an American investor, motivational speaker, and author of the book &#8220;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&#8221; &#8211; forecasted a grim future for the US dollar, advising people to focus on precious metals and bitcoin. He believes the primary cryptocurrency can skyrocket to $120,000 in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The leading British banking institution – Standard Chartered &#8211; also thinks the asset can reach that milestone next year.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another Bullish Prediction</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">South Africa will host the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, and China (a group of countries known as BRICS) in August this year to discuss the possible creation of a new currency. Kiyosaki <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1678652054951317504" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">expects</a> the nations to introduce a new cryptocurrency backed by gold, which could harm the American dollar:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;US $ will die. Trillions of US $ rush home. Inflation through the roof.&#8221;<br />
</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He urged consumers to invest in gold and silver as a protection measure. Like his previous statements, he touched upon Bitcoin, seeing it rise to $120,000 in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kiyosaki, who was among the few to forecast the 2008 economic collapse, believes BTC is the right investment tool in times of a severe financial crash or inflation. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a result, he believes BTC could reach $500,000 by 2025, whereas the yellow metal and silver could tap $5,000 and $500, respectively.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Others like MicroStrategy&#8217;s Executive Chairman &#8211; Michael Saylor &#8211; and Ark Invest&#8217;s CEO &#8211; Cathie Wood &#8211; have </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/we-see-btc-at-1-million-michael-saylor-and-cathie-wood-at-bitcoin-2022-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">predicted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> an even brighter future for BTC, suggesting its price could hit $1 million, albeit within a different timeframe.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has been oscillating in a tight range below the $2,000 psychological resistance level, failing to break higher. Yet, several support zones are available for investors to feel confident that the market will not crash.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: Edris</p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily chart, the price has been going through choppy action, following the breakout above the $1,800 level and the 50-day moving average around the $1,850 mark.</p>
<p>The aforementioned moving average is currently providing support for the market. However, in case of a breakdown, the $1,800 level and the 200-day moving average trending around the $1,700 mark are potential support elements for the price to rebound.</p>
<p>Moreover, the RSI indicator provides little insight into this timeframe, as it has been running flat around the 50% threshold, indicating momentum equilibrium.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Things look a bit clearer on the 4-hour chart, as the price has been rejected from the $1,920 resistance level recently. The short-term support level at the $1,840 mark is currently being tested, holding ETH from dropping further.</p>
<p>However, there is a high probability for the mentioned level to break down, resulting in a sharp decline toward the $1,760 support zone. On the other hand, if ETH breaks above the $1,920 area, the market will likely enter a bullish phase once more, with the price surging toward the $2,000 level and even higher in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p>By: Edris</p>
<h3>Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio</h3>
<p>Ethereum has been consolidating lately, failing to break above the key $2,000 level. While the spot market seems strong, the derivatives market is seemingly responsible for the price&#8217;s failure to rally higher.</p>
<p>This chart represents the taker buy-sell ratio (with a 100-day exponential moving average applied), which is a useful metric in evaluating the futures market sentiment. Values above 1 indicate aggressive buying pressure; values below 1 are associated with dominant selling pressure.</p>
<p>Analyzing the chart, it is evident that the metric has once again failed to rise above 1 and is currently on a steep decline. This signal indicates that futures traders are aggressively shorting ETH, as they do not expect the market to break above the $2,000 level.</p>
<p>The resulting selling pressure is currently preventing the market from continuing its uptrend. However, in case the spot market demand prevails against the futures market supply, a bullish breakout higher would be imminent.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP has exhibited turbulent price action and high volatility since early April, leaving traders uncertain about the market’s future direction.</p>
<p>However, it is likely that the price will continue to consolidate within the range defined by the 100-day and 200-day moving averages in the medium term.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By Shayan</p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Taking a look at the daily chart, XRP&#8217;s price underwent a corrective consolidation phase, pulling back towards the 200-day moving average situated at $0.44.</p>
<p>This retracement occurred after failing to surpass the key resistance region of $0.55. The $0.55 zone holds significant psychological resistance, as it has repeatedly hindered XRP price movements in the past. Notably, there is a considerable amount of supply in this region, indicating aggressive selling pressure.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the price is expected to remain within a dynamic range bounded by the resistance level of the 100-day moving average at $0.4828 and the support level of the 200-day moving average at $0.4372 in the short term. Consequently, a breakout from this critical range will likely determine Ripple&#8217;s next move.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259924" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-259924 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_1107231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-daily-1-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-259924" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>On the 4-hour timeframe, there has been a decline in the price below the mid-boundary of the channel, followed by a retracement and pullback. However, after completing the pullback to the broken level, XRP has started another downward movement, indicating a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a descending wedge pattern has formed on the 4-hour timeframe, characterized by white trendlines. This pattern typically suggests a potential bullish move if the XRP price breaks above the upper trendline.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cryptocurrency seems more likely to continue ranging within the descending wedge pattern until a breakout occurs. In the event of a breakout above the upper threshold, there is a possibility of an attempt toward the $0.55 resistance level.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fields of Web3 and artificial intelligence have been flourishing lately, helping produce an array of exciting crypto startups.</p>
<p>Among these, <a href="https://bs_72a7e4de.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-ai-crypto-ypredict-generates-huge-interest-nears-3m-presale-milestone" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">yPredict ($YPRED)</a> is creating quite a buzz with its innovative and ambitious features.</p>
<p>Leveraging the power of advanced AI technology, yPredict offers an array of tools to provide crypto analytics, SEO solutions, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259912" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-9.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="213" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-9.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-9-300x106.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-9-50x18.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2>Reinventing SEO Strategies with yPredict’s Backlink Estimator</h2>
<p>One of the key tools rolled out by yPredict is its AI-powered backlink estimator – a tool designed to revolutionize SEO strategies.</p>
<p>This marks a significant milestone for yPredict as it expands its scope to offer content solutions for medium to large-scale teams, widening its target audience.</p>
<p>This backlink estimator feature is trained on over 100 million links, with its main function being to predict the backlink profile needed for a site to rank a specific keyword.</p>
<p>In turn, this eradicates the guesswork in SEO and allows for more precise strategies.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-11.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259911" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-11.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="252" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-11.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-11-300x126.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-11-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Originally launched as a free preview, the backlink estimator garnered over 5,000 requests within the first 24 hours.</p>
<p>However, after its immediate success, the yPredict team has launched the tool to the masses – with a pricing structure of $99/query, per a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/yPredict_ai/status/1677305434636517376" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a> from the official yPredict account.</p>
<p>Interestingly, those who purchase $YPRED tokens through yPredict&#8217;s ongoing presale will have complete access to the backlink estimator tool and other models the development team has in the pipeline.</p>
<p>This arrangement has further fueled interest in the yPredict ecosystem, with the project&#8217;s presale rapidly nearing the $3 million funding mark.</p>
<p>Currently, would-be investors can purchase <a href="https://bs_72a7e4de.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-ai-crypto-ypredict-generates-huge-interest-nears-3m-presale-milestone" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$YPRED tokens</a> through this presale for just $0.09 &#8211; a discount on the planned exchange listing price.</p>
<h2>yPredict’s Game-Changing Platform Revolutionizes Crypto Analytics</h2>
<p>While the SEO tools mark a thrilling expansion of yPredict&#8217;s offerings, the core features of the platform are centered around crypto analytics.</p>
<p>Per yPredict’s <a href="https://docs.ypredict.ai/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, the platform seeks to be a game changer by offering state-of-the-art AI-powered tools that provide objective insights to traders worldwide.</p>
<p>The yPredict platform uses machine learning models to analyze colossal amounts of price data, which allows it to identify trends and provide valuable market guidance to users.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-11.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259910" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-11.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="353" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-11.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-11-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-11-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Not only that, but the platform will also provide AI-driven trading signals, automated pattern recognition, and market sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>yPredict has recently unveiled a beta version of the platform, inviting interested users to explore its capabilities by joining the project’s <a href="https://s.surveyplanet.com/h7p13rld" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">waitlist</a>.</p>
<p>However, even if users choose not to utilize the yPredict Analytics suite, they can still access the yPredict Predictions platform for free, as long as they hold $YPRED tokens.</p>
<p>This approach is designed by the yPredict team to make AI-powered crypto and stock price predictions accessible to all, effectively democratizing the process.</p>
<h2>Alt_Pump_001 Model Unravels the Potential of Altcoins</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_72a7e4de.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=new-ai-crypto-ypredict-generates-huge-interest-nears-3m-presale-milestone" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">yPredict</a> is also making strides by announcing Alt_Pump_001 – an AI-powered model designed to offer insights into the altcoin market.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking tool equips investors with the means to identify future altcoins that have the potential to surge by 100x or more.</p>
<p>Despite being available through a subscription model priced at over $1,000 per month, Alt_Pump_001 can be accessed for free by presale buyers who purchase a minimum of $500 in $YPRED.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259909" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-5.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="305" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-5-300x152.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-5-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Naturally, the development of Alt_Pump_001 further underlines the development team’s commitment to leveraging the power of AI to maximize trading outcomes.</p>
<p>Given the potential of the altcoin market, this tool could be of tremendous value to investors – a fact that has helped prompt an influx of new members into the yPredict <a href="https://t.me/ypredict" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<h2>$YPRED Token Fuels yPredict’s Cutting-Edge Ecosystem</h2>
<p>As hinted at throughout this article, $YPRED will serve as the core of yPredict’s revolutionary platform.</p>
<p>This AI utility token will be built using the power of the Polygon blockchain, ensuring it remains fast and secure.</p>
<p>Alongside being used to access yPredict’s premium features, the token can also be staked to earn monthly rewards.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259908" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-2.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="252" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-2.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-2-300x126.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-2-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Not only that, but the development team has structured $YPRED’s tokenomics in such a way as to decrease the chance of a rug pull occurring once it is listed on the open market.</p>
<p>A whopping 80% of the total $YPRED supply is being made available through the ongoing public presale, with the remaining 20% allocated for liquidity, treasury, and developmental purposes.</p>
<p>This fair token structure is another key reason yPredict has been generating traction in the market, with high-profile YouTuber Michael Wrubel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwoCQl5h4qE&amp;t=459s&amp;pp=ygUPeXByZWRpY3QgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stating</a> that he is “bullish” on the project.</p>
<p>All in all, yPredict’s combination of AI-powered analytics tools and its revolutionary approach to SEO strategies set the stage for what could be a transformative experience in the world of digital assets.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin's price is doing rounds in 2023. As we enter the third quarter for the year, here are six factors worth your consideration.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin price doubled in the first half of 2023 after melting off the ice of crypto winter in early January. Is it time to take profits, or does this six-month BTC rally have more in store for Q3?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With persistent interest rate hikes, weakness in the banking sector and debt ceiling concerns, investors see bitcoin now more than ever as a sovereign, safe haven asset that has held strong and steady in the face of market uncertainty.&#8221; -Alex Adelman, CEO of Bitcoin app Lolli.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since rallying to $29,900 on June 22, Bitcoin has been trading sideways in a range-bound channel between $30,100 and $31,100. That follows a surge upward from the $25,000 level in the middle of June, the lowest price for the coin since March.</p>
<p>Before that, Bitcoin price fell in a two-month tumble from the $30,300 level in mid-April.</p>
<p>Current spot prices happen <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/06/bitcoin-13-month-high-valkyrie-refiles-spot-bitcoin-etf-crypto-world.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">to be</a> close to a 13-month high level for Bitcoin. Is the market overheated or gearing up for another rally?</p>
<p>The following six factors in the Bitcoin price are overall bullish in the Q3 outlook, but they&#8217;re a mixed bag. There are also some headwinds rising for the OG cryptocurrency to weather.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETF Fervor on Wall Street</h2>
<p>Institutional investors are, by this time, chomping at the bit to get the private keys to blockchain assets into their portfolios. ETF buzz has already pushed Bitcoin&#8217;s price higher, but there&#8217;s room left to rally if anyone&#8217;s SEC application actually gets approved.</p>
<p>As Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/spot-bitcoin-etf/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> near the end of June:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The SEC has already approved plenty of Bitcoin ETFs and other types of crypto exchange-traded funds. But so far, the market regulator has only been comfortable greenlighting funds that track cryptocurrency futures or own the stocks of companies with indirect exposure to crypto.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, investors on Wall Street are clamoring for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Crypto markets are anxiously awaiting the SEC&#8217;s approval of the first one. Because of market uncertainty over the SEC&#8217;s resistance to a spot ETF, the approval of one would likely cause an immediate reevaluation of the Bitcoin price.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of companies that have filed <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/not-just-blackrock-these-companies-have-also-filed-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-in-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> applications with the SEC. They include BlackRock, Ark Invest Management, Invesco, Fidelity Digital Assets, WisdomTree, and Valkyrie.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin_binary_cover-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259900" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin_binary_cover-1.jpg" alt="bitcoin_binary_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin_binary_cover-1.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin_binary_cover-1-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin_binary_cover-1-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin_binary_cover-1-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bitcoin_binary_cover-1-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Bitcoin DeFi, Ordinals, and BTC NFTs</h2>
<p>Loathe to allow Ethereum, Solara, and Polkadot to have all the fun minting NFTs, some enterprising devs introduced the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-lauds-bitcoin-ordinals-believes-brc-20-standard-could-revive-stagnancy/" data-wpel-link="internal">BRC-20 standard</a> for minting non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain earlier this year.</p>
<p>As a result, Bitcoin has never seen anything like the record daily transaction volume the network serviced last quarter on May 1. That day, the old Satoshi blockchain&#8217;s <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_transactions_per_day" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">users made</a> 682,281 transactions in a 24-hour period.</p>
<p>Since then, daily transactions have driven a level of network activity that we haven&#8217;t seen since the first half of 2021 during that year&#8217;s hot crypto bull market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this key metric of fundamental value is already on track in July to set another record. On July 9, Bitcoin processed and completed 594,265 transactions.</p>
<p>Much of this season&#8217;s intense transaction volume consisted of Bitcoin NFT sales. In fact, so-called &#8220;Ordinals&#8221; <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-record-daily-transactions-network-ordinals-protocol-cryptocurrency-btc-crypto-2023-5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">made up</a> over half of BTC&#8217;s record-setting total on May 1, at some 54.6%.</p>
<h2>A Spike in Institutional Interest</h2>
<p>As time goes on, institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has only increased, not abated. That&#8217;s especially true for blue chips like BTC and ETH.</p>
<p>The recent launch of the first leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF on June 27, for example, triggered a wave of on-chain BTC token purchases by funds.</p>
<p>Starting on June 18th, ahead of the SEC&#8217;s approval of the new 2x leveraged futures product, funds <a href="https://terminal.bytetree.com/bitcoin/flows/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">hoovered up</a> 19,083 BTC over 21 days. At a spot price of $30,500 per 1 BTC, that was an over half-a-billion dollar blitz for institutional investors.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t stop buying up on-chain tokens in June. Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange saw contract volumes <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-interest-spikes-btc-eth-024341255.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">increase by</a> 28.6% in June to $37.9 billion.</p>
<p>In another sign of institutional appetite, the Bitcoin futures premium for BTC contracts <a href="https://www.binance.com/en-NG/feed/post/735119" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">recently doubled</a> in a week&#8217;s time to 6.4% on July 3 from 3.2%. That&#8217;s a bullish portent for the Bitcoin price, and furthermore, there seems to be more room left for it to rise.</p>
<p>This could mean reversion, as futures premiums ran low over the past year, but it might indicate healthy demand for open interest in the future Bitcoin price moving forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bitcoinbull_cover-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-169779" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bitcoinbull_cover-1.jpg" alt="bitcoinbull_cover (1)" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bitcoinbull_cover-1.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bitcoinbull_cover-1-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bitcoinbull_cover-1-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bitcoinbull_cover-1-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bitcoinbull_cover-1-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Fundamentals</h2>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The year after Bitcoin halving is usually the bull year.&#8221;<br />
<em>-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Twitter Spaces (July 5, 2023)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>BTC daily transaction volume, <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">network hash rate</a>, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-model/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">stock-to-flow against price</a> numbers are all running at bullish levels and are backed by real momentum going into Q3. This bodes well for a continuing rally.</p>
<p>Bear markets are for builders, and with the overwhelming enthusiasm for the new Bitcoin products we&#8217;ve seen in H1, it really shows.</p>
<p>While transaction volume is higher than ever with these new use cases for Bitcoin, most holders of BTC are doing just that. <a href="https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Bitcoin-Monthly-June-2023.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According to</a> Ark Invest&#8217;s June monthly Bitcoin report, 70% of the BTC supply hasn&#8217;t moved for a year.</p>
<p>Because Bitcoin is an economic currency (not a financial one) with a limited supply, the BTC economy&#8217;s tightness with the supply over the past 12 months is an indicator of possibly higher prices on crypto exchanges for the precious digital asset.</p>
<h2>Global Regulatory Hawkishness</h2>
<p>As the old Wall Street saying goes: Markets abhor uncertainty.</p>
<p>The unfolding saga of SEC regulation by lawsuit and enforcement against cryptocurrencies has certainly raised a number of questions about the nascent industry&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the IRS is missing in action as the industry and crypto holders await tax rules for digital assets. As Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/26/crypto-tax-regulations-00101937" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported on</a> June 26:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The long-awaited IRS tax compliance rules are stuck in an unexplained delay even as the SEC aggressively targets the crypto industry for regulation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even as Bitcoin and its rivals continue to post ROIs beyond the pale of what investors are accustomed to expecting on stock exchanges (even from high-flying stocks like Tesla and Nvidia), institutions are still cautious to enter the blockchain space because of regulatory ambiguity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a drag on crypto prices across the board, including BTC. Bitcoin is taking some heat from regulators in the U.S. and around the world, but not nearly like its competitors are.</p>
<p>Most notably, the SEC&#8217;s push to regulate many blockchain tokens as securities has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-coinbase-and-binance-lawsuits-super-bullish-for-btc-and-eth-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">conspicuously left</a> Bitcoin and Ether, among others, out of the hot seat. So, regulatory threats to the Bitcoin price may be balanced by worse threats to some of its competitors.</p>
<h2>Global Macro Financial Factors</h2>
<p>Like regulatory concerns for blockchain, global macro factors in crypto prices are a mixed bag for Bitcoin in the next quarter and beyond.</p>
<p>June&#8217;s pause on months of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and ECB was the most pivotal financial event of the previous quarter.</p>
<p>BTCUSD markets seemed to love it, or at least not mind it at all, as they rallied from $25,000 in mid-June to above $30,000 in under a week&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>Relief from rising prices to borrow money to make capital investments in businesses, or buy stocks and cryptocurrencies, is a tailwind for markets. But it seemed to get priced into BTC&#8217;s chart within days, and more interest rate hikes may await markets later this year if the current regime does not whip inflation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, analysts are pushing back U.S. recession projections to next year or even projecting a <a href="https://www.bigcountrynewsconnection.com/news/state/washington/washington-state-forecast-predicts-u-s-economic-slowdown-not-recession/article_88042da4-7fdf-5f41-87cd-56cd345a2203.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">slowdown instead</a> of a recession. On balance, that&#8217;s good news for just about everyone, not the Bitcoin price especially, and not excluding BTC prices.</p>
<p>But of particular importance to Bitcoin: Energy prices have been falling worldwide for a year. Oil prices <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price?type=wti" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">closed at</a> $121/barrel a year ago. This month, oil closed at $73 on July 10.</p>
<p>Given the importance of electricity to Bitcoin&#8217;s proof-of-work blockchain, as one of the main costs for miners to deliver the network&#8217;s services, this is very bullish for the oldest cryptocurrency&#8217;s spot prices.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Cardano looks like it&#8217;s about to make a significant move soon. Here are three technical indicators to watch.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.26, $0.24</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.30, $0.32</strong></p>
<h2>1. Ascending Triangle</h2>
<p>The price action of this cryptocurrency has formed a clear ascending triangle, as highlighted in the below chart. This makes a possible breakout above the resistance at $0.30 likely. Since the price is being compressed at the apex of this formation, ADA will have to decide fairly soon on the way forward.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259868" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259868" style="width: 1826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-259868" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01.png" alt="ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01" width="1826" height="902" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01.png 1826w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01-1024x506.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01-768x379.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01-1536x759.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-24-01-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1826px) 100vw, 1826px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-259868" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>2. MACD Bullish Crossover</h2>
<p>The 3-day MACD of Cardano shows that a bullish crossover may happen this week. If so, then a breakout above $0.30 becomes more probable. On the daily timeframe, the MACD is already positive, which gives bulls the upper hand right now.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259867" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259867" style="width: 1825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-259867" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55.png" alt="ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55" width="1825" height="902" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55.png 1825w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55-1024x506.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55-768x380.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55-1536x759.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-29-55-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1825px) 100vw, 1825px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-259867" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Resistance Under Pressure</h2>
<p>The resistance at $0.30 has kept ADA from moving higher in June, but in July, it seems this cryptocurrency has a great chance to finally break it. Every time a key resistance is tested by the price, the likelihood of it breaking increases. Currently, the buyers seem as if they&#8217;re about to make a third attempt at moving the price higher.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259882" style="width: 1826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-259882" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55.png" alt="ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55" width="1826" height="844" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55.png 1826w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55-1024x473.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55-768x355.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55-1536x710.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ADAUSDT_2023-07-11_13-50-55-50x23.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1826px) 100vw, 1826px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-259882" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for ADA is neutral right now but can quickly turn bullish as soon if the key resistance is broken.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for ADA Price</h2>
<p>If buyers manage to break above $0.30, then ADA&#8217;s price will quickly move to $0.32 and $0.35, which are the next targets. However, if the breakout fails, then this cryptocurrency has good support at $0.26.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple's CTO and the well-known XRP attorney John Deaton shared some thought as to when the ruling in the case against the SEC might come.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The case between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple is one that the entire cryptocurrency community is looking at. The outcome of the lawsuit is likely to determine whether XRP is a security &#8211; a decision that might have considerable implications for the rest of the industry.</p>
<h2>Ripple v. SEC Case: When Ruling?</h2>
<p>John E. Deaton, an attorney representing thousands of XRP holders, as well as David Schwartz, have laid out some thoughts on when they think a ruling in the case against the SEC might be coming.</p>
<p>Deaton made it clear that there&#8217;s nothing so unusual in the fact that Judge Analisa Torres is taking relatively long to pass a ruling. Per Deaton, it&#8217;s been seven months so far, but Ripple isn&#8217;t the only one in the waiting room.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the Thor Equities case, also before Judge Torres, the Reply Briefs were also filed in December. Judge Torres hasn&#8217;t yet ruled.</p>
<p>In the N.Y. Disctrict Carpenter&#8217;s fund case, Judge Torres&#8217;summary judgment took over eight months from the Reply Briefs.</p>
<p>Quiller Inc. VS U.S.A took SEVEN months for Judge Torres&#8217; Decision. The Fitzgerald case, and several others I could name, took SIX months for Judge Torres to rule.</p></blockquote>
<p>Deaton concluded that even though he believed a ruling would have been out by now, &#8220;there are other cases and examples that have taken an equal amount of time.&#8221; He also said that the judge is likely aware of the magnitude of her decision.</p>
<h2>September&#8217;s the Month?</h2>
<p>Commenting under Deaton&#8217;s Twitter thread was none other than Ripple&#8217;s CTO &#8211; David Schwartz. He said that it&#8217;s understandable that people are annoyed as waiting itself is annoying. However, he added that he wouldn&#8217;t think something was wrong, unusual, or strange &#8220;until at least the end of September.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Deaton agreed:</p>
<blockquote><p>On September 30th [corrected by editorial], Judge Torres would be placed on the 6-month naughty judge list for the first time and her decision would be pending over 9 months. I didn&#8217;t review every case she has had but I didn&#8217;t find any that were longer than 9 months (although one was slightly longer than 8 months).</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Dubai, United Arab Emirates, July 11th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://pikamoon.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Pikamoon,</a> an emerging Ethereum blockchain game, has raised $3.6 million in its ongoing ICO to bring more value to the Ethereum ecosystem and revolutionize the blockchain gaming space. Pikamoon would launch the world’s most immersive metaverse game and a first-of-its-kind earning model that allows players to withdraw their in-game rewards directly to their wallet or bank account without the need for a third party.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Pikamoon focuses on becoming the most realistic metaverse game where players can get a 360-degree experience of the growing virtual space through unparalleled gameplay, stunning visuals, and innovative DeFi features. Drawing inspiration from legendary games like Fortnite, Pokemon, and FIFA, the Ethereum game has leaped forward and is prepared to blend NFTs, video gaming, and metaverse entertainment perfectly.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The Pikamoon game is built on Unity, the world’s most advanced game development technology, to create the stunning visuals and architecture needed to give players a truly immersive experience.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Additionally, Pikamoon is built across two blockchains: Ethereum and MultiversX (formerly Elrond). While Ethereum provides scalability, MultiversX complements it by providing efficiency and ensuring the game is environmentally friendly by reducing carbon emissions generated by transactions. This dual blockchain feature ensures that the Pikamoon ecosystem can cater to legions of gamers without any lag.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_2023-07-11_at_113639_1689064806IU4w0Bn5ye-744x1024.jpg" /></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Gaming enthusiasts and smart investors are convinced Pikamoon is the future of gaming, and this is evident in how fast phase one and phase two of the ICO sold out. In the first phase, one PIKA sold for $0.0002, which increased to $0.0004 in the second phase, and now in the third and last phase, one PIKA is selling for $0.0006 and selling out faster.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Notable partners of this Ethereum-based game include future-thinking Web3 brands such as Ethereum, Transak, Cryptonews.com, Kevuru Games, and MultiversX. This line-up of industry leaders further reinforces the credibility of the project, reaffirming the fact that the team is committed to building the best of the best gaming projects.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Pikamoon offers investors the opportunity to enter what is strategically seen as a huge market of the Metaverse and gaming on the Ethereum blockchain. A core feature of the PIKA token is its deflationary nature. Whenever a sell or transfer transaction occurs in the Pikamoon ecosystem, 0.5% of the tokens involved in the transaction are burned forever, translating into more profits for long-term investors.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The much-talked-about presale, which is still on, uses Ethereum as its base currency, becoming the new favorite of the Ethereum community. This seamless integration with Ethereum not only simplifies the investment process for eager investors but also strengthens the overall Ethereum ecosystem.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stories of remarkable gains and life-changing investments are not uncommon in the world of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Many of these tales revolve around crypto traders turning modest amounts into millions by investing in Pepe ($PEPE) – this year’s breakout meme coin star.</p>
<p>Moreover, these inspiring stories ultimately beg the question: What could be the next cryptocurrency to produce 1,000x returns?</p>
<h2>Czech Trader’s $PEPE Investment Makes Them a Crypto Millionaire</h2>
<p>One of the most prominent examples of $PEPE turning someone into a millionaire is from a Czechoslovakian trader who recently <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/720801" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on the Binance Feed.</p>
<p>This trader, who goes by the name IB_JUNIOR, states that he discovered $PEPE on April 17 – immediately before the coin&#8217;s bull run.</p>
<p>After reviewing the token, the trader opted to invest &#8220;a small sum&#8221; – and within 24 hours, their investment had multiplied by over 1,000x.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-10.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259840" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-10.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="484" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-10.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-10-300x241.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-10-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly, the trader opted to hold out rather than immediately cash in.</p>
<p>This decision proved beneficial, as when the trader eventually sold their $PEPE tokens in early May, they made a whopping 4,000% return.</p>
<p>As IB_JUNIOR notes, he &#8220;turned his initial investment into millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>This incredible story is a shining example of the transformative power of cryptocurrency investments – especially in the ever-evolving meme coin niche.</p>
<h2>Pepe’s Market Impact Creates Extraordinary Gains &amp; Anonymous Fortunes</h2>
<p>However, IB_JUNIOR&#8217;s success story is one of many that&#8217;s made headlines.</p>
<p>In mid-April, crypto journalist Constantine Crypto <a href="https://twitter.com/Keldamaa88/status/1649000971446435842" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> about an anonymous trader who invested $250 in $PEPE – and saw it turn into $1.02 million.</p>
<p>At the time, the trader owned 5.9 trillion $PEPE tokens, although whether they were able to cash out their profits remains unclear.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-10.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259839" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-10.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="668" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-10.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-10-270x300.jpg 270w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-10-45x50.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Crypto YouTuber ClayBro also released a video on $PEPE’s “millionaire maker” status, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Z5h2hxk0U&amp;ab_channel=ClayBro" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">highlighting</a> several crypto wallets that became multi-millionaires during the token’s three-week bull run.</p>
<p>Much like the trader referenced by Constantine Crypto, the owners of these wallets remain anonymous – but their remarkable gains demonstrate the immense wealth-building potential of low-cap coins.</p>
<p>All in all, these stories underscore the allure and excitement surrounding the meme coin niche, which has captured the attention of both newbies and market veterans worldwide.</p>
<h2>What Could Be the Next Crypto to Explode?</h2>
<p>However, with many believing that Pepe’s heyday may be behind it, attention is now being paid to which meme coins could be the next to explode in value.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes has emerged as an interesting contender in this regard, having already raised $13.2 million in its recently-launched presale phase.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Looks Ready for Price Pump After $13.2m Presale Raise</h2>
<p>As its name implies, <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=this-trader-became-a-millionaire-by-investing-1000-in-pepe-can-wall-street-memes-be-the-next-big-meme-coin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is a brand-new meme coin project that draws inspiration from the subculture formed around the r/WallStreetBets subreddit.</p>
<p>Although not directly connected to this subreddit, Wall Street Memes holds many of the same values – and uses a similar branding style to appeal to retail investors.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes team has already experienced success in the realm of digital assets. This is evidenced by the remarkable response to the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall St Bulls NFT</a> collection, which completely sold out within a mere 32 minutes back in 2021.</p>
<p>Now the team hopes to replicate that success with $WSM, which has made an incredible impact on the retail trading community.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-8.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259836" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-8.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-8.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-8-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-8-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Although the token isn’t yet available on the open market, this hasn’t stopped meme coin enthusiasts from clamoring to acquire $WSM through the ongoing presale.</p>
<p>This is because presale investors can purchase $WSM tokens for just $0.031 – which is expected to be a discount on the eventual CEX listing price.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just retail investors getting involved, with crypto influencer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHGxKJjOzIU&amp;pp=ygUYd2FsbCBzdHJlZXQgbWVtZXMgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">My Financial Friend</a> stating that $WSM could be &#8220;the biggest new crypto coming to the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the optimism around Wall Street Memes shows no signs of slowing – hinting that it could be the next big crypto to hit the market.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Paris, France, July 11th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://nebular.builders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Nebular Summit</a>, Europe’s premiere Interchain builders conference, returns to Paris, France, July 24th and 25th, 2023. Key thought leaders, founders, engineers, and investors will unveil the latest innovations within the Interchain developer community and discuss divisive issues crucial to the ecosystem’s long-term success.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Teams have fortified the Cosmos stack for dApp scalability and cross-chain compatibility for years. As it matures, developers recognize its stability for building Web3 apps. However, Interchain grapples with the inherent challenges of decentralized leadership, market liquidity challenges, and direct competition with Ethereum L2s. The upcoming year will be vital in shaping this space’s future.” says <a href="https://twitter.com/seb3point0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Sebastien Couture</a>, Founder of <a href="https://interop.ventures/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Interop Ventures</a> and Organizer of Nebular Summit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thought leaders of Cosmos are vocal about critical issues jeopardizing the network’s long-term success, such as the lack of coordination mechanisms for infrastructure development (e.g., MetaMask sign-in), lack of usable native stablecoins, and liquidity challenges impacting Cosmos DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>Despite these threats, unlike Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solutions adapting to interoperability, Cosmos was designed to embrace modular and interoperable dApps from the start, learning from past cycles, which infrastructure is crucial for long-term success.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://thedefiant.io/dydx-chain-cosmos/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">dYdX’s</a> announced migration from an Ethereum L2 dApp to its own Cosmos-based blockchain bolstered the ecosystem, and the <a href="https://www.cointrust.com/market-news/dydx-to-unveil-public-testnet-of-its-cosmos-powered-blockchain-next-week" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">testnet launched</a> on July 5th.</p>
<p>Alongside the momentum spurred by dYdX’s adoption of Cosmos, the wider ecosystem is experiencing significant financial and infrastructure growth, evident from recent metrics.</p>
<p>This year Neutron raised $10M to develop smart contracts on Cosmos, Polymer Labs raised $3.6M to expand the use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol standard to other ecosystems, Circle plans to launch USDC on Cosmos via Noble, the Interchain Foundation allocated $40M for ecosystem development in 2023, and Injective Labs launched a $150M ecosystem fund to support interoperable infrastructure and DeFi.</p>
<p>Cosmos is redefining how interconnected chains that leverage a common technology stack can benefit builders and projects looking for solutions to interconnectivity issues.</p>
<p>Paris remains a prime location for fostering Web3 innovation, with the influential Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) gathering thousands of developers each year.</p>
<p>And in April, the European Parliament adopted “Markets in Crypto-Assets” (MICA), meaning they are the first governing body to establish regulations for crypto assets and stablecoins, welcoming crypto projects to the EU, including France.</p>
<p>This year’s Nebular Summit themes will explore the emerging modular blockchain stack, the Cosmos SDK, CosmWasm, IBC, cross-chain MEV, Interchain Security, zero-knowledge, and more through a series of technical talks and intense debates.</p>
<p>Its highlight speakers include Charles d’Haussy, CEO of dYdX Foundation, who enables community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability of the dYdX protocol, Ethan Buchman, Co-Founder of Cosmos itself and of Informal Systems, a Rust and Formal Verification for Cosmos, Sunny Aggarwal, Co-Founder of Osmosis, the largest interchain decentralized exchange in the Cosmos ecosystem and Zaki Manian, Co-Founder of Sommelier Finance, a platform that aims to optimize DeFi with off-chain computation and improved interoperability.</p>
<p>The conference starts with Nebular Hack Day on July 23rd, a free-to-attend event offering technical workshops by dYdX, Neutron, Juno, OKP4, Lava Network, Gno.land, and more.</p>
<p>Nebular Summit is curated by Interop Ventures, a venture fund concentrating on the rapidly evolving Interchain ecosystem.</p>
<h2>About Nebular Summit</h2>
<p>Nebular Summit is a confluence for teams and innovators from every corner of the Interchain universe.
