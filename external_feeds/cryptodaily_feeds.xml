			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, all eyes are on DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI) and its potential to replicate the success of TMS Network, while updates on ChainLink (LINK) and TRON (TRX) keep investors engaged. Launched in May 2023, DogeMiyagi has swiftly gained momentum, drawing inspiration from "The Karate Kid" and the iconic Doge meme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a growing market cap, this meme coin is on the verge of virality, joining the ranks of DOGE and PEPE. But what sets DogeMiyagi apart is its strategic alignment with the Ethereum staking trend and its commitment to community and decentralization. Will MIYAGI unleash its meme coin magic and become the next big sensation in the crypto world?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Updates on Chainlink and TRON</p>
<p>TRX Sets the Stage for Higher Liquidity:</p>
<p>Tron Stake 2.0 is on the horizon, offering increased staking flexibility and durations. This upgrade could attract more users, leading to higher rewards and liquidity. However, TRX's price action remains limited, consolidating around $0.065.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chainlink (LINK) establishes a solid support level, hinting at potential growth with a golden cross formation in sight. However, it's TMS Network (TMSN) that steals the spotlight with its record-breaking presale.</p>
<p>Trading Reinvented</p>
<p>TMS Network (TMSN) has gained momentous levels of popularity as it revolutionizes the trading experience with its decentralized platform, which allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, CFDs, and Forex seamlessly, all backed by secure and transparent blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No middlemen mean lower costs and faster transactions. With an intuitive interface and educational resources, TMSN empowers traders of all levels. Users can say goodbye to high fees and welcome instant deposits and withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>From Karate Chops to Crypto Swaps</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI) enters the bullish market with a meme coin karate chop! Inspired by "The Karate Kid" and the legendary Doge meme, DogeMiyagi has swiftly gained momentum since its recent launch. With a growing market cap, this coin is on the path to virality, joining the meme coin season rally with SHIB and PEPE!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, what really makes DogeMiyagi stand out is its perfect timing with the Ethereum staking trend. As Ethereum transitions to Proof-of-Stake, staking rewards have reached all-time highs, attracting investors to Ethereum-based projects, including meme coins like DogeMiyagi. Drawing inspiration from the iconic character Mr. Miyagi, DogeMiyagi embodies profound life lessons and has even earned the prestigious Medal of Blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not just about the memes but also about embracing a community that believes in decentralization and shared ownership. DogeMiyagi's vibrant ecosystem offers NFTs, crypto discussions flow, and fun side-splitting memes. The meme coin lets holders seamlessly interact with other wallets, all while staying true to sustainability principles.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is undergoing continuous evolution, presenting great potential for DogeMiyagi as it rapidly gains momentum. Furthermore, with TMSN revolutionizing the trading experience, the world of crypto offers traders fresh opportunities. This dynamic and ever-changing realm of finance makes it an exhilarating time to be actively involved!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins have gained attention as a distinctive phenomenon in the cryptocurrency realm, captivating audiences with their viral nature and community-oriented approach. Two meme coins, namely Big Eyes Coin (BIG) and Caged Beasts (BST), are generating significant interest in 2023. Big Eyes Coin's impressive presale success has created anticipation for its imminent launch on a reputable exchange. On the other hand, Caged Beasts stand out by using the metaphor of "Caged Beasts" to represent "Caged Liquidity," offering transparency and a firm commitment to security. Both Big Eyes Coin and Caged Beasts exemplify the potential and ingenuity that meme coins bring to the crypto space, captivating investors and enthusiasts alike.</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s Big Launch</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has generated substantial buzz in the cryptocurrency realm, amassing an impressive $38.5 million during its presale. As the presale deadline of June 3rd approaches, the team is diligently preparing for the highly anticipated launch of $BIG on a renowned CEX. While the specific exchange remains unconfirmed, speculation within the crypto community suggests possibilities such as Binance, Kucoin, and OKX.</p>
<p>The ambitious six-month exchange roadmap of Big Eyes Coin includes listings on various platforms like Gate.io, Bitget, BKEX, MEXC, and more. Demonstrating the team's unwavering commitment to growth and progress, this roadmap provides investors with compelling reasons to participate before the launch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond establishing a presence in the cryptocurrency market, Big Eyes Coin is also venturing into the realm of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Currently in development is their exclusive NFT collection, SushiCrew, featuring iconic cat characters synonymous with the project. These unique and highly collectible NFTs possess distinctive characteristics and traits, strengthening the project's brand and creating additional revenue streams for the community. Positioned to capitalize on the growing NFT market, Big Eyes Coin solidifies its position as a significant player in the crypto space.</p>
<p>The Cage Beasts Roadmap: Plot, Pre-sale, Release</p>
<p>Caged Beasts (BST) introduces a captivating metaphor of "Caged Beasts" to represent "Caged Liquidity," setting it apart from other community tokens. Beyond caged liquidity, Caged Beasts aims to revolutionize the finance industry through decentralization, liberating individuals from the feeling of being confined. With 75% of funds dedicated to liquidity, it embraces a decentralized system, empowering the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, 25% of funds are allocated to the marketing wallet, highlighting the importance of substantial investments for establishing a prominent presence. Active engagement within the community is encouraged, offering exciting activities, competitions, bonuses, events, voting mechanisms, and exclusive announcements, including NFT releases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Cage Beasts roadmap unfolds in three stages: The Plot, The Pre-sale, and The Release. In The Plot, social channels are established, a website is set up, a token audit is conducted, and KYC checks and locked wallets are verified. The Pre-sale stage includes launching the website and social channels, initiating PR activities, releasing NFTs, organizing engaging stunts, fostering an active community, and making charitable donations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Release stage will mark a significant leap in securing a listing on a reputable exchange, conducting final testing, holding an awareness event, releasing tokens, running advertising campaigns, adding liquidity, unveiling final NFTs, bridging to more chains, and seeking additional exchange listings. The roadmap aims to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry by creating a decentralized ecosystem that challenges traditional finance norms.</p>
<p>While this may be the last chance to invest in Big Eyes Coin at the presale price, one must look forward to securing a spot in the upcoming Caged Beasts presale and receiving timely updates. All you have to do is sign up with your email at the bottom of the page. Don't miss out on these two limited-time opportunities that can turn your crypto journey around.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has grown in leaps and bounds since it first began. With the induction of the first cryptocurrency, there was an atmosphere of innovation and advancement as it ushered in a pathway and a glimpse into the future of finance.</p>
<p>Since then, we have had many coins rise and fall, some being completely obliterated by the competitive nature of the market. However, the latest innovation in the market is that of meme-coins, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which bring about a light-hearted nature to the normally serious demeanor of the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has become a force to be reckoned with since last year with its speedy growth, sublime rewards system, and grand community of investors. The platform has shown great potential with everything they have done, and as they prepare to launch in less than a month, the next six months seem like an exciting time for the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has a range of products and services in store for investors and loyal users, as well as easily accessible tokens which are to be listed on popular exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Journey, New Rewards</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has worked diligently to deliver the best quality products and services to its community of users and investors. During the ongoing presale, the platform has a wide variety of profitable opportunities. From the loot boxes to NFTs to bonuses, Big Eyes Coin did not shy away from rewarding its clientele in the best of ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next six months, Big Eyes Coin community members can look forward to a Big Eyes Coin Casino, which will have over 4,000 games and a variety of Play-to-Earn (P2E) games that come with their rewards. The casino will be fully operational in August, and users can play using only $BIG, which will likely reduce the supply of tokens on exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now is a fantastic chance to earn tokens during the current presale and build up your Casino Kitty. Buy your tokens now using the code END300 for a 300% bonus and avoid scarcity!</p>
<p>BIG Plans For Exchanges</p>
<p>When a cryptocurrency is listed on an exchange, it is the same as being picked up by a record label to being starred in a big movie - it brings about recognition and credibility to the brand. This is the next step for Big Eyes Coin because the platform wants to develop a larger community of investors through visibility, authenticity, and accessibility. The best way to do so is through exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin plans to launch on several exchanges, possibly starting with Tier 1 Exchange and Uniswap and including Bitget, CoinEx, BitMart, Deepcoin, and Gate.io, to name a few. This will ensure that Big Eyes Coin maintains a steady level of growth and can gain access to a wider and possibly global market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Altogether, the months following the launch are bound to be some of the most exciting times for both Big Eyes Coin and the community. Although Big Eyes Coin is going to be now on the market, it is speculated to be a solid competitor for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu based on how well it performed during the presale. Once the launch happens, Big Eyes Coin will face an exhilarating phase of growth, one that will be most profitable for both the platform and its investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faced another roadblock in its Ripple lawsuit as a judge ruled against its motion to block the controversial Hinman documents from being made public.&nbsp;</p>
Hinman Documents Won&rsquo;t Be Sealed
<p>In a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs Inc., a court has denied the regulator&rsquo;s request to seal documents related to former SEC official William Hinman's statements about Ether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court's decision to deny the SEC's request to seal the Hinman Speech Documents is seen as a victory for Ripple. Hinman, formerly the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance director, delivered a speech in 2018 suggesting that Ether was not a security. Ripple believes that these statements hold relevance to its case, as they provide a precedent for a digital asset similar to XRP.</p>
<p>The dispute centers around the SEC's classification of XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple, as a security. Ripple has vehemently opposed this categorization and has accused the SEC of providing insufficient clarity regarding its regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>
Hinman Speech Not Protected: Judge Torres
<p>The latest ruling represents a potential breakthrough for the crypto firm in its fight against the SEC's allegations. Judge Analisa Torres, who is overseeing the Ripple lawsuit, had previously passed a ruling ordering the regulator to hand over the documents to Ripple&rsquo;s legal team. The judge's latest decision to ensure that the Hinman documents remain open to the public reflects the importance of transparency in legal proceedings and emphasizes the public's right to access relevant information in such high-profile cases.</p>

<p>"As Judge Netburn found in her order dated January 13, 2022, the Hinman Speech Documents are not protected by the deliberative process privilege because they do not relate to an agency position, decision, or policy.

Ripple Team Hopeful About SEC Case
<p>Ripple's legal team has hailed the court's decision as a significant step towards a fair resolution.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faced another roadblock in its Ripple lawsuit as a judge ruled against its motion to block the controversial Hinman documents from being made public.&nbsp;</p>
Hinman Documents Won&rsquo;t Be Sealed
<p>In a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs Inc., a court has denied the regulator&rsquo;s request to seal documents related to former SEC official William Hinman's statements about Ether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court's decision to deny the SEC's request to seal the Hinman Speech Documents is seen as a victory for Ripple. Hinman, formerly the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance director, delivered a speech in 2018 suggesting that Ether was not a security. Ripple believes that these statements hold relevance to its case, as they provide a precedent for a digital asset similar to XRP.</p>
<p>The dispute centers around the SEC's classification of XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple, as a security. Ripple has vehemently opposed this categorization and has accused the SEC of providing insufficient clarity regarding its regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>
Hinman Speech Not Protected: Judge Torres
<p>The latest ruling represents a potential breakthrough for the crypto firm in its fight against the SEC's allegations. Judge Analisa Torres, who is overseeing the Ripple lawsuit, had previously passed a ruling ordering the regulator to hand over the documents to Ripple&rsquo;s legal team. The judge's latest decision to ensure that the Hinman documents remain open to the public reflects the importance of transparency in legal proceedings and emphasizes the public's right to access relevant information in such high-profile cases.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ripple has made a $250 million acquisition of Metaco - one of crypto&rsquo;s most well known custodians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move sees Ripple take on sole responsibility at Metaco while allowing current CEO Adrien Treccani room enough to steer operations independently - crucial given his leadership undoubtedly played a role in getting the company to where it is now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monica Long, the President of Ripple who hinted that customers would benefit significantly from this deal said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adding these capabilities to Ripple's already growing product solutions means we can continue to support customers as they look to embrace the true potential of crypto and blockchain in real world applications.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Ripple&rsquo;s ongoing battle with the SEC
<p>Although this purchase is viewed by many as a positive sign for the future of both companies Ripple remains embroiled in an ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding XRP&rsquo;s classification status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this ongoing regulatory challenge, Ripple remains focused on maintaining stability - as evidenced by its recent silence. This stability is further supported by the acquisition of Metaco as Ripple seeks to carve out its niche within an ever-changing payments industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, Ripple has partnered with large banks, explored remittances, and shifted towards cross-border payments. Its resurgence within the broader crypto community coincides with attention garnered from the SEC lawsuit against it - which could have significant repercussions for digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently hanging in the balance is whether XRP will be deemed a security. Should it fall under regulation as a security there will likely be consequential implications across cryptocurrencies at large- something CEO Brad Garlinghouse acknowledges having fought this battle with the SEC at great financial expense to his business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amidst speculation regarding Ripple&rsquo;s future, Garlinghouse has expressed his belief that a decision may be made within the year. In his eyes this would bring much desired clarity and steadiness to Ripple&rsquo;s trajectory.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent panel hosted by IoTeX, a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) tech and infra provider, focused on the advances in Account Abstraction (AA) and its impact on the Web3 space, including its potential to bring the next billion new users to Web3.</p>
<p>The DePIN panel discussion on Twitter spaces included Intu Co-CEO and Co-Founder James Bourque and IoTeX CEO and Co-Founder Raullen Chai. Noam Hurwitz of Alchemy, Danny Salman of Polygon Labs, Third Web DevEx Engineer Ciara Nightingale, Web3 Foundation's Bader Youssef, and Larry Pan, IoTeX Head of Business Development, also participated.</p>
<p>The panelists agreed that AA could onboard the next wave of adopters in the Web3 space. By abstracting away the complexities of the blockchain, AA can create a seamless user experience where users won't even know that they are interacting with blockchain technology. That could be a gamechanger for the industry and pave the way for developing the next massively used dApp.</p>
<p>Explaining why AA will spark further adoption</p>
<p>Account Abstraction allows for a more sophisticated approach to managing blockchain assets by abstracting away the underlying account model of a blockchain. That means that users no longer have to worry about managing private keys and can instead interact with the blockchain using a more user-friendly approach. AA essentially makes accounts smart contracts, so instead of being an externally owned account (which requires the owner to sign transactions), smart contracts can interact directly with the blockchain. This creates a more seamless user experience that can be more accessible to people who are new to crypto.</p>
<p>Bourque explained that at Intu,</p>

<p>"we have been aiming to achieve similar things to account abstraction since we started. We're firm of the opinion that together a kind of multi-party computation and cryptography with account abstraction is really the clear path to that user experience, that human-first experience that I think will bring the next billion users to crypto."</p>

<p>More user-friendly and intuitive</p>
<p>AA makes it possible to create more complex and sophisticated applications on the blockchain. With smart contracts accounts that manage assets, developers can create more sophisticated decentralized applications (dApps) that offer a wide range of services, from asset management to peer-to-peer transactions. This means that users can take advantage of the full potential of the blockchain and access a broader range of more user-friendly and intuitive applications.</p>
<p>By making the blockchain more user-friendly, developers can create applications that are more intuitive and easier to use, even for people who are not tech-savvy. The panelists agreed that this could lead to a surge in the adoption and usage of decentralized applications, which could bring about a new era of innovation and growth in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Ethereum and Account Abstraction</p>
<p>Ethereum Foundation is at the forefront of account abstraction. In 2021, Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin and other blockchain experts released the account abstraction proposal, which strives to improve the user experience and security of crypto wallets, among other things.</p>
<p>Tom Tamen of the Ethereum Foundation is part of the team working on his company's EIP 4337, which he said is a continuation of his personal goal to take blockchain to the average person. He believes Web3 is fast approaching the tipping point where developers will build "a killer app" that will spark the next wave of adoption.</p>
<p>IoTeX's Pang said,</p>

<p>"The onboarding of the masses is definitely something that is top of mind. However, he said he firmly believes "that the ease of onboarding traditional companies into Web3 will be greatly simplified with account abstraction."</p>

<p>The need for more Web3 developers</p>
<p>Danny thinks AA "really brings us the idea of being able to develop where you would live in a contemporary (traditional or mainstream) software environment without needing to know anything about blockchain or crypto."</p>
<p>He rightly pointed out the need for more developers in the Web3 space, saying there are currently at most 35,000 blockchain developers worldwide, while in traditional sectors, there are nearly 30 million globally.</p>
<p>AA in the DePIN space</p>
<p>DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks. For simplicity purposes, it is the Web3 IoT, which many experts believe is set to bring the next big wave of users to crypto.</p>

<p>"AA in DePIN will make it easier for users worldwide to access blockchain accounts." Because the multi-trillion-dollar machine economy is currently powered by tens of billions of smart devices, this could potentially be the path for new users into the Web3 space, said Raullen Chai.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Think about the traditional Internet of Things deployment. There's a lot of co-ownership of every single gateway that connects to all these different types of sensors. And the ability to represent these things in an abstracted kind of hierarchical way is something that's brand new and is going onboard a ton of companies that want to use decentralized infrastructure", reiterated Larry Pang.</p>

<p>The race to mass adoption</p>
<p>The race to bring the first billion to crypto is not new. However, account abstraction raises hope for that milestone to be achieved. In a recently published article entitled On Keys and Code: Account Abstraction and the Race to 1 Billion Users, Brian Astrove wrote that AA is "the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something to reduce complexity and increase efficiency."</p>
<p>Astrove said user accounts need more flexibility, making it challenging to build experiences that mainstream users will accept. Today, if you lose your public key, you lose your private key, you also lose your assets.</p>

<p>"This is why more flexibility is critical to onboard new waves of users. It opens the door for user experiences we expect in 2023, with security features like password recovery and multi-party signing. This is what account abstraction promises," he added.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Many investors are unsure where to focus their attention as they pour into the cryptocurrency market in hopes of making long-term money. Today, we will look at three that might be worth your time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may be familiar with Decentraland (MANA) and The Sandbox (SAND) as they have begun to rise in the past week. However, one project currently in Stage 2 of its presale has all the capability to generate tremendous gains down the road - Tradecurve (TCRV)! Let&rsquo;s see why!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Decentraland (MANA)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentraland (MANA) recently introduced a new Executive Director, Yemel Jardi. He was previously a DAO Committee member but has since stepped down, hoping to guide the Decentraland (MANA) in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentraland (MANA) has a value of $0.5688, which is a rise of 5.20% in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, the Decentraland (MANA) trading volume has increased by 17% and now sits at $78,828,370.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the technical analysis for Decentraland (MANA) paints a neutral picture, with its moving averages showing mixed signals. The Decentraland (MANA) daily time frame signs point to overwhelmingly optimistic purchasers. Because of this, experts claim that Decentraland (MANA) may see a jump to $0.60 soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Sandbox (SAND)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent news, The Sandbox (SAND) announced a raffle that will bring many prizes, such as LANDs and auctions occurring in the Mega Cities. This news caused hype among The Sandbox (SAND) community pushing the price up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, The Sandbox (SAND) is trading hands at $0.6082, which is a rise of 5.41% in the past 24 hours. The Sandbox (SAND) trading volume has also increased by 42%, reaching $92,095,117.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sandbox (SAND) technical analysis also paints a positive picture with its technical indicators and moving averages in the green. These charts have made experts bullish about The Sandbox (SAND), with some even predicting a $0.90 value for The Sandbox (SAND) by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) will enter the online trading industry with a bang, bringing something traders have only dreamed of. This Ethereum-based, hybrid trading exchange will allow users to trade multiple asset classes such as crypto, gold, stocks, and even forex - all on one account with no FIAT payments required!&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is correct; just create an account with your email since Tradecurve (TCRV) will require no KYC checks, link it to your crypto wallet and after you make a deposit - begin trading!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) will also enable users to subscribe to AI trading bots and algorithms that have proven successful! By holding the native token, TCRV, you may obtain discounts on these tools, staking rewards, and more. And as TCRV currently costs just $0.01, now is the right moment to purchase it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>As the presale is currently in Stage 2, more price hikes are expected, with analysts predicting a rise to $0.60 by the end of it. Also, when the token gets listed on a major exchange, it may jump by 100x!&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quell any rug-pull fears, know that Tradecurve (TCRV) has already obtained a token smart contract audit and will lock liquidity for two years, while team tokens will be frozen for three.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign up for the presale now and obtain this potential blue-chip token for an affordable price!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s10">InQubeta (QUBE) is a Crowdfunding Platform that Yields Exponential Profit for Investors</p>
<p class="s7">InQubeta is the world's first crypto crowdfunding platform that allows fractional investment in AI start-ups using QUBE tokens. InQubeta is a deflationary ERC20 token developed to revolutionize how AI start-ups raise money and interact with their communities. With each investment opportunity minted into an NFT and fractionalized, investors can invest in InQubetain a way that suits their budget while enjoying the benefits of being an early investor. </p>
<p class="s7">InQubeta's NFT marketplace allows AI start-ups to raise funds and offer rewards and equity-based NFTs. The QUBE presale is gaining momentum on Twitter, having already attracting a legion of followers. It would only be natural for these numbers to increase rapidly over the next few months.</p>
<p class="s7">As more investors and start-ups participate in the InQubeta platform, the demand for the QUBE ERC20 token is expected to rise, driving the token's value over time. By holding and staking QUBE tokens, investors can benefit from potential price appreciation and earn rewards from the dedicated reward pool.</p>

<p class="s10">Avalanche (AVAX) Offers a Valuable Alternative to Traditional Crypto Systems</p>
<p class="s7">Avalanche (AVAX) is a peer-to-peer, open-source proof-of-stake blockchain with smart contract functionality. It is a high-throughput Smart contract blockchain platform. The native cryptocurrency of the platform is AVAX, which is used to secure the network and pay transaction fees.</p>
<p class="s7">Avalanche is considered an alternative to the Ethereum network, and the network features lower fees and faster transaction speeds than Ethereum. The Avalanche blockchain is capable of handling 4,500 transactions per second.</p>
<p class="s7">Staking AVAX validates transactions and secures the network. As an incentive for staking AVAX, you earn rewards and stakes by becoming a validator. Validators must use AVAX to verify transactions on the network. Each Avalanche validator validates transactions independently and randomly selects a small subset of the other validators. </p>
<p class="s10">Polygon (MATIC) Prepares for Future Price Surges</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) is an established cryptocurrency that functions as a layer-2 solution on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides solutions to the scalability issues and increased gas fees of the Ethereum network, which are significant issues that users have often complained about. </p>
<p class="s7">A prominent feature that makes Polygon a more relevant DeFi coin is the availability of an efficient and cost-effective way to process transactions, unlike the expensive fees that the Ethereum blockchain requires. This leads to an increase in demand for Polygon among investors.</p>
<p class="s7">MATIC has been the best cryptocurrency for investors looking for cheaper ways to carry out faster transactions. Polygon's increased popularity could signal a more significant price rise.</p>
<p class="s7">Conclusion</p>
<p class="s7">Crypto experts have considered InQubeta a rising star that could outpace the momentum of Avalanche and Polygon. This is because Inqubeta creates a more transparent, secure, and democratic investment ecosystem that fosters the growth and success of AI technology start-ups. InQubeta is the best crypto to buy because it meets profitable investment criteria.</p>
<p class="s7">The best time to invest in InQubeta is now, it is widely believed that QUBE could outperform major cryptocurrencies in the coming months. InQubeta holds enormous potential and could become one of the leading cryptocurrencies on the market by the close of the year.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Things just keep heating up in crypto. As AI continues to run rampant through the world, we&rsquo;re now seeing a large number of projects springing up that leverage AI as their unique selling point.So, how exactly are you to find these new 100x potential AI startups?</p>
<p>InQubeta is your answer. It&rsquo;s a revolutionary platform that allows fractional investment in AI startups using $QUBE tokens. The $QUBE token is designed to be deflationary, transparent, and democratic - creating a more secure and democratic investment ecosystem for all AI startups as they navigate the crypto market. </p>
<p>The platform is the first of its kind, offering a unique way for AI startups to raise funds and engage with their community. Investors can also benefit from staking their tokens.</p>
<p>The NFT marketplace enables AI startups to raise funds and offer reward and equity-basedNFTs, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem for $QUBE token holders. Overall, InQubetaprovides a groundbreaking approach to investing in AI technology, making it an attractive investment choice for those who believe in the growth potential of AI startups.</p>
<p>How Will InQubeta Fare Against Solana And Polkadot?</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform that aims to offer fast and cheap transactions at scale. It uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH) that helps to reduce network latency and increase throughput. Solana has been used for a range of applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming.</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) is a next-generation blockchain platform that aims to connect different blockchain networks together into a single ecosystem. It uses a unique architecture that allows different blockchains to communicate and share data with each other, creating a "multi-chain" network. Polkadot has gained a lot of attention due to its potential for interoperability and scalability, and has been used DeFi, NFTs, and identity verification. Polkadot also uses a unique consensus mechanism called Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) that allows token holders to participate in the network's governance.</p>
<p>While both of these projects have been very successful in their own right, they&rsquo;ve both been around for a while now, and may face growth issues in 2023 especially in comparison to newcomers in the space like InQubeta.</p>
<p>▪️Click Here To Buy InQubeta &nbsp;▪️</p>
<p>5 Reasons Why Solana (SOL) And Polkadot (DOT) Could Be Overtaken ByAnother Project in 2023:</p>
<p>Regulatory Challenges: The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is still in constant and consistent &nbsp;flux, and new regulations could impact the growth and adoption of Solana and Polkadot. Both projects could face regulatory hurdles in certain jurisdictions, which could lead to reduced adoption or even complete bans.</p>
<p>Security Risks: While Solana and Polkadot have robust security features, they are not immune to cyber attacks. If either project experiences a major security breach, it could definitely shakeinvestor confidence and lead to a loss of users - as has happened in the past.</p>
<p>Limited Adoption: Although Solana and Polkadot have shown promise in terms of adoption, they may struggle to reach a wider audience compared to more established projects. If they fail to gain significant traction, they could be overtaken by a more widely adopted project - like InQubeta.</p>
<p>Governance Issues: Both Solana and Polkadot have unique governance models that rely on stakeholder participation. However, if these models fail to function as intended or lead to contentious decision-making, it could harm the reputation of these projects and push users and investors to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Economic Downturns: The crypto market is notoriously volatile and subject to economic cycles. If there is a significant downturn in the market in 2023, it could hurt the growth prospects of Solana and Polkadot and lead investors to consider other options - this is especially true considering the losses both projects have experienced in the past.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web3, the new iteration of the internet, is growing its stock. Whether it's metaverses and NFTs, or online gaming and communications, this space is expanding, and that means communities are key to what comes next. What&rsquo;s more, the fact that the users are the owners of this space, there&rsquo;s even more incentive to grow and nurture communities. That being said, the space is still emerging and to ensure its success, projects need to place great importance on privacy and security for their communities, utilising the vast array of Web3 tools and solutions on offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this ultimate guide, we&rsquo;ll explore various aspects of Web3 community building, such as how to build communities that are engaged, loyal, and profitable, how to define communities and their demographics, how to measure the success of your community with metrics and how you can growth hack tangible data to scale up. Let&rsquo;s get underway.&nbsp;</p>
Defining Your Web3 Community
<p>Does your Web3 community revolve around a project? A game? A blockchain? An NFT collection? To start effectively building a community in this space, you need to know who your audience is, their demographics, their goals, and their values. Anything and everything you can learn about them can be leveraged to maximise the efficacy of your group and its growth.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re clear on who they are and what they stand for, you need to combine those things and align them with the mission statement of your community. If your Web3 community wants to unite gamers, the values might be fairness, asset ownership, and teamwork. If it&rsquo;s about NFT collections, it&rsquo;s more likely to be spotting gems in the marketplace, digital creativity, and web humour. Spend a good amount of time on this section as it has been known to make or break the success of some communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip: Become a member of similar or rival communities and glean as much information as possible. Look at what they do well and what they can improve upon.&nbsp;</p>
Building Your Web3 Community
<p>There are six steps to actually building a community, moving beyond the theory and into the practical process.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Choosing the right communication channels - Discord, Telegram, Twitter?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Creating a social media strategy - Humorous? Serious? Video-based announcements?&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Developing a content plan - Medium or Substack? PR placements or backlinking? SEO?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Hosting events &amp; meetups - IRL events? Private &amp; secure videoconferences on Relayz?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Creating&nbsp; participation incentives- NFT or crypto rewards? Badges? Zealy (ex-Crew3)?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Setting up a feedback loop - SurveyMonkey? Google Forms?&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ve given suggestions above, but really that&rsquo;s all they can be - suggestions. Only you can really know your community and where they hang out. Knowing that it&rsquo;s Web3 and the audience is generally younger, it&rsquo;s unlikely they&rsquo;ll be active on Facebook, where the average user is older. Could your community be hanging out on TikTok or Instagram? It&rsquo;s plausible, but you&rsquo;ll need to do your own research (always DYOR) to find them.&nbsp;</p>
Nurturing Your Web3 Community
<p>Great community engagement and customer service will help lay the groundwork, but you need to think about how you&rsquo;ll drive collaboration and feedback, starting with those community members who are actively trying to get involved. On top of creating those opportunities, you need to be transparent with your people, authentically letting them know what is going on, and what is happening in regard to the future of your project. The whole time, you also need to consider privacy and security for your community, leveraging Web3 solutions such as Relayz and Signal to protect conversations.</p>
Measuring Your Web3 Community's Success
<p>There are three parts to measuring the success of a community in Web3, and it&rsquo;s really quite simple:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Identify KPIs</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Set goals and track progress</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Analyse data and make adjustments</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break it down a little further.</p>
<p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are specific metrics that allow you to track your progress towards pre-defined community goals. Let&rsquo;s say each month you want 1,000 new members in your Telegram or Discord, 100,000 reach on Twitter.</p>
<p>After setting your KPIs, the community goals and how you track them will come into play, so consider how specific, measurable, and realistic they are. Tracking your progress keeps you focused and heading in the right direction, but sometimes, your community might veer slightly off track and you need to bring it back. Be dynamic, identify trends, and pivot when it serves your community and the mission well. If engagement in one area is low, try something different - if it&rsquo;s high in another area, dig in and find out why. Grow and thrive, but don&rsquo;t get stuck in a rigid box - be flexible and adaptable to change, that&rsquo;s the nature of Web3.&nbsp;</p>
Scaling Your Web3 Community
<p>Whilst some communities want to stay small and niche, they are in the minority. Most want explosive growth to support a project, business, game, protocol, or something in this Web3 realm that requires participation for success. There are four corners to scaling a Web3 community, and you&rsquo;ll need to know where to divert your energy and effort based on previous success, understanding your community, and the mission statement you prepared previously.&nbsp;</p>
Corner one: Growth Strategy
<p>Scaling a Web3 community will require building and sticking to a strategy that is confidently aligned with your mission and values. You&rsquo;ll need to do everything we&rsquo;ve talked about, such as identifying your audience, considering the reach and efficacy of different platforms and tools, looking at communication channels and approaches, and how you will use the community to launch products and services. You&rsquo;ll know the metrics and KPIs you want to achieve, and will measure performance against them as you go.&nbsp;</p>
Corner two: Partnerships and Collaborations
<p>You can only do so much before you realise that other communities, projects, businesses, and people have the power, numbers, and creativity to help you scale. As you dive into partnerships, you can tap into their existing audiences and reach new people who might never have found you otherwise. Through cross-promotion, joint events, dual initiatives, and more serious ideas such as mergers and acquisitions, you have huge scaling opportunities to consider. Remember, however, that any potential partnership must reflect the community values you are founded on, otherwise growth can reverse and people may walk away.&nbsp;</p>
Corner three: Developing a Governance Model
<p>In Web3, scaling reaches a tipping point whereby the community has reached a level of size and participation that requires more democracy and governance. Fortunately, this has been solved in a number of ways. Moderators and admin help to govern the group at first, but later, it usually ends up with the formation of a DAO - decentralised autonomous organisation. This allows community members to transform into community owners, giving them voting power and building consensus. Key to any DAO or alternative governance model is the establishment of transparent rules and processes to ensure everyone has the opportunity to have a voice and be heard.&nbsp;</p>
Corner four: Scaling Community Infrastructure
<p>As your community expands, you might face certain challenges that require you to invest in new tools and technologies. You might need to invest in larger group limits, management software for leads and opportunities, private Web3 communications platforms, and tools for managing tasks, initiative, rewards, or governance. Fortunately, Web3 is expanding rapidly and new tools are popping up to make sure that people in this space are well accommodated technologically.&nbsp;</p>
Finally, Embrace the Process
<p>Once you have defined who you are, how you want to communicate this, and how you will grow, you are well positioned to make an impact in Web3. While we have included some of the essential steps to help you build a community in Web3, there is an almost infinite number of ways that you can grow and build in this ever-evolving space. Focus on prioritising what is important, effective, and scalable, and your Web3 community will follow.</p>

Knowing that it&rsquo;s Web3 and the audience is generally younger, it&rsquo;s unlikely they&rsquo;ll be active on Facebook, where the average user is older. Could your community be hanging out on TikTok or Instagram? It&rsquo;s plausible, but you&rsquo;ll need to do your own research (always DYOR) to find them.&nbsp;</p>
Nurturing Your Web3 Community
<p>Great community engagement and customer service will help lay the groundwork, but you need to think about how you&rsquo;ll drive collaboration and feedback, starting with those community members who are actively trying to get involved. On top of creating those opportunities, you need to be transparent with your people, authentically letting them know what is going on, and what is happening in regard to the future of your project. The whole time, you also need to consider privacy and security for your community, leveraging Web3 solutions such as Relayz and Signal to protect conversations.</p>
Measuring Your Web3 Community's Success
<p>There are three parts to measuring the success of a community in Web3, and it&rsquo;s really quite simple:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Identify KPIs</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Set goals and track progress</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Analyse data and make adjustments</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break it down a little further.</p>
<p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are specific metrics that allow you to track your progress towards pre-defined community goals. Let&rsquo;s say each month you want 1,000 new members in your Telegram or Discord, 100,000 reach on Twitter.</p>
<p>After setting your KPIs, the community goals and how you track them will come into play, so consider how specific, measurable, and realistic they are. Tracking your progress keeps you focused and heading in the right direction, but sometimes, your community might veer slightly off track and you need to bring it back. Be dynamic, identify trends, and pivot when it serves your community and the mission well. If engagement in one area is low, try something different - if it&rsquo;s high in another area, dig in and find out why. Grow and thrive, but don&rsquo;t get stuck in a rigid box - be flexible and adaptable to change, that&rsquo;s the nature of Web3.&nbsp;</p>
Scaling Your Web3 Community
<p>Whilst some communities want to stay small and niche, they are in the minority. Most want explosive growth to support a project, business, game, protocol, or something in this Web3 realm that requires participation for success. There are four corners to scaling a Web3 community, and you&rsquo;ll need to know where to divert your energy and effort based on previous success, understanding your community, and the mission statement you prepared previously.&nbsp;</p>
Corner one: Growth Strategy
<p>Scaling a Web3 community will require building and sticking to a strategy that is confidently aligned with your mission and values. You&rsquo;ll need to do everything we&rsquo;ve talked about, such as identifying your audience, considering the reach and efficacy of different platforms and tools, looking at communication channels and approaches, and how you will use the community to launch products and services. You&rsquo;ll know the metrics and KPIs you want to achieve, and will measure performance against them as you go.&nbsp;</p>
Corner two: Partnerships and Collaborations
<p>You can only do so much before you realise that other communities, projects, businesses, and people have the power, numbers, and creativity to help you scale. As you dive into partnerships, you can tap into their existing audiences and reach new people who might never have found you otherwise. Through cross-promotion, joint events, dual initiatives, and more serious ideas such as mergers and acquisitions, you have huge scaling opportunities to consider. Remember, however, that any potential partnership must reflect the community values you are founded on, otherwise growth can reverse and people may walk away.&nbsp;</p>
Corner three: Developing a Governance Model
<p>In Web3, scaling reaches a tipping point whereby the community has reached a level of size and participation that requires more democracy and governance. Fortunately, this has been solved in a number of ways. Moderators and admin help to govern the group at first, but later, it usually ends up with the formation of a DAO - decentralised autonomous organisation. This allows community members to transform into community owners, giving them voting power and building consensus. Key to any DAO or alternative governance model is the establishment of transparent rules and processes to ensure everyone has the opportunity to have a voice and be heard.&nbsp;</p>
Corner four: Scaling Community Infrastructure
<p>As your community expands, you might face certain challenges that require you to invest in new tools and technologies. You might need to invest in larger group limits, management software for leads and opportunities, private Web3 communications platforms, and tools for managing tasks, initiative, rewards, or governance. Fortunately, Web3 is expanding rapidly and new tools are popping up to make sure that people in this space are well accommodated technologically.&nbsp;</p>
Finally, Embrace the Process
<p>Once you have defined who you are, how you want to communicate this, and how you will grow, you are well positioned to make an impact in Web3. While we have included some of the essential steps to help you build a community in Web3, there is an almost infinite number of ways that you can grow and build in this ever-evolving space. Focus on prioritising what is important, effective, and scalable, and your Web3 community will follow.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Japan, once an economic powerhouse, has been grappling with economic stagnation since the early '90s. The country, which missed out on the Web2 revolution &mdash; by failing to produce its own Meta, Google, Amazon, and Alibaba &mdash; is now looking to regain its economic prowess by embracing the burgeoning crypto and Web3 industry. In this regard, the Japanese government has already recognized the potential of this sector, so much so that it has made Web3 a major part of its national strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, in September 2022, the government published a white paper &mdash; which has since been approved &mdash; discussing the implementation of several future-ready technologies, including blockchain, central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDCs), etc, into its existing governance and technological frameworks.</p>
<p>As a result, a number of reputable Japanese firms, such as Toyota, Sony, and NTT, have showcased a keen interest in various decentralized offerings. Not only that but moving ahead, decision-makers in Japan see the Web3 paradigm as the next big opportunity for local companies to forge ahead and stand at the forefront of the global economy.</p>
A Look at Japan&rsquo;s Crypto Ambition
<p>Japan's ambition to become a leader in the Web3 industry seems to be driven by its need to compete internationally and to counteract a shrinking domestic market due to an aging population. Japanese companies are being encouraged to invest more in software and create platforms &mdash; possibly on the blockchain &mdash; to grow the nation&rsquo;s economic influence outside of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the Asian powerhouse is also looking to leverage its world-class intellectual property in manga, anime, and computer games in the Web3 space, particularly through NFTs. However, there is a knowledge gap, with many creators unsure of how to deploy their creations on the blockchain.</p>
<p>To this point, Sota Watanabe, the founder of Astar Network and a member of the Japanese Government's web3 task force, recently explained: "A lot of digital creators, gaming companies would like to work on Web3, especially NFTs. But the problem is they don't know how to.&rdquo;</p>
The Digital Yen Initiative - A Gamechanger?
<p>In a move that further underscores Japan's commitment to the crypto revolution, the Japanese government announced late March that it is considering forming a panel to examine the advantages of a digital Yen. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is set to move ahead with a pilot program for a digital currency, and the Finance Ministry's expert panel will debate how to design an institutional ecosystem for the digital yen.</p>
<p>The BOJ has been conducting proof of concept tests on the digital yen since 2021, focusing on issuing and circulating the currency, among other basic functions. The initial rounds of tests were recently concluded, and recently the central bank has been conducting field tests with private-sector banks. This initiative is part of a global trend, with several countries ramping up studies of central-bank-issued digital currencies.</p>
Embracing Globalization: The Need for International Collaboration
<p>As Japan embarks on its journey to become a global leader in the Web3 industry, its need for international collaboration has become quite evident. The country's ambition to regain its economic prowess and compete on the global stage requires not just domestic efforts but also strategic partnerships with international entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this point, Watanabe rightly pointed out recently that the country&rsquo;s lack of an English-speaking population is somewhat of a hindrance when it comes to posturing Japan as a major hub for global technical innovation, adding:</p>

<p>"We have a bunch of other people who understand Japanese business and can speak Japanese, but we don't have many people who understand the global business and who can speak English very well."</p>

The Road Ahead
<p>Despite the enthusiasm and some recently launched Web3 initiatives, there are still many challenges that Japan needs to overcome to become a world leader in this space. Firstly, the country needs to produce at least one groundbreaking Web3 company, and secondly, it needs to introduce more regulatory clarity to attract more entrepreneurs. On the need for a successful global use case, Watanabe added:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In the age of Web3, we have to make something new. We have to make a very innovative company that can become big, just like Sony or Toyota. If we cannot make it, I think our economy is going to shrink...So it is really important for Japan to make at least one successful use case within the Web3 arena."</p>

<p>Therefore, as move toward a future driven by decentralized technologies, Japan's rapid embrace of crypto and Web3 seems to be a strategic move &mdash; seemingly in the right direction &mdash; to regain its economic prowess and compete on the global stage. And while the country is making significant strides the journey ahead will most likely be fraught with challenges that need to be addressed to ensure continued, guaranteed success.</p>

<p>Therefore, as move toward a future driven by decentralized technologies, Japan's rapid embrace of crypto and Web3 seems to be a strategic move &mdash; seemingly in the right direction &mdash; to regain its economic prowess and compete on the global stage. And while the country is making significant strides the journey ahead will most likely be fraught with challenges that need to be addressed to ensure continued, guaranteed success.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sky Mavis and Axie Infinity are taking steps toward regaining lost users.&nbsp; The game is now available for download on the Apple App Store.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of their blockchain-powered 'Axie Infinity: Origins, is now available for download on Apple's App Store and promises players an engaging adventure filled with battles galore as well as rewards in NFT form.&nbsp;</p>
Roll out across Latin America and Southeast Asia
<p>To ensure success upon its global launch, Sky Mavis has decided to debut 'Axie Infinity: Origins' in select countries across Latin America and Southeast Asia first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As reported by The Block, the Vietnamese studio plans to collect crucial user retention data before rolling it out globally. Countries included in the initial release are Argentina, Columbia, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam &mdash;offering players from various regions the opportunity to step into the world of Axies.&nbsp;</p>
Sky Mavis collaborates with Apple
<p>Collaboration between Sky Mavis and Apple has been an ongoing project for a year now with co-founder Jeffrey Zirlin optimistic about future developments that better align Apple's policies with web3 companies' needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable easy integration with third-party marketplaces and allow in-app purchases for NFTs are paramount goals as per Zirlin, despite challenges arising from Apple's restrictions on NFT-related transactions. Inspiration comes from bold steps taken by industry giants such as Epic Games that challenge similar constraints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Sky Infinity: Origins' debut on the App Store is poised to drive significant growth particularly among iPhone users says Zirlin who points out that referrals play a crucial role in growing their user base; currently at 70%, sourced from friends and family circles respectively. Presence on the App Store remains an essential factor when it comes to expanding awareness of Sky Mavis within gaming communities.&nbsp;</p>
The most successful Web3 game
<p>At present, 'Axie Infinity: Origins' leads as the most-played web3 game with over 1.5 million downloads based on Sky Mavis's estimates. The pandemic brought about phenomenal success for Axie Infinity as it reached unprecedented heights within the world of web3 gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to its play-to-earn model, millions were introduced to this game generating an outstanding $4 billion in trading volume with Filipino players earning their livelihood through it. Sky Mavis's visionary approach made Axie Infinity a renowned brand, catching mainstream interest and establishing new standards for web3 gaming and NFT collections.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Embattled crypto lending firm Celsius is wasting no time in removing its stash of staked ETH (stETH) tokens from the liquid staking platform Lido.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lido has just enabled withdrawals, and Celsius could face a prolonged wait before it can get its hands on the staked ETH.&nbsp;</p>
Celsius Moving Fast&nbsp;
<p>Celsius&rsquo;s staked ETH stash has been valued at around $784 million at current prices. On the 15th of May, eagle-eyed watchers identified a transaction on Celsius wallets for around 428,015 staked ETH to the Lido staked ETH wallet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;428k #Celsius $stETH on the move - likely lining up for staking directly without #LIDO in the middle. That&rsquo;s the loan collateral proposed for NewCo. Should get an update during a court hearing this week - the 17th of May - No court approval needed for this, it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Celsius has initiated the process of withdrawing its stash from the protocol. According to data from Etherscan, Celsius has requested the withdrawal of around 428,984 stETH. The withdrawal will be carried out in batches of 1000. Blockchain Intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence had stated that Celsius had transferred nearly 41,000 ETH into a smart contract called &ldquo;Figment ETH2 Beacon Depositor 1,&rdquo; which was then moved to the Ethereum Beacon Chain deposit contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lido had enabled withdrawals on the 15th of May through a protocol upgrade. The company added in a statement,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lido V2 introduces two major components, with the most user-facing aspect being Ethereum withdrawals. This allows Ethereum stakers with Lido to directly unstake ETH through the protocol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lido accounts for nearly 29% of all staked ETH, valued at over $11 billion.&nbsp;</p>
A Growing Withdrawal Queue&nbsp;
<p>Once the withdrawal process has been completed, Celsius will receive an equal value in ETH, while Lido will burn the corresponding staked ETH tokens. According to data from Dune Analytics, the amount of stETH in the queue for withdrawal is steadily growing, with the current number at 442,000 from 141 requests. The value of the tokens in queue for withdrawals stands at around $808 million, with Celsius responsible for a majority of the stETH in the withdrawal queue. So far, the total amount already processed stands at 1858 ETH, according to Dune.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lido added that it had more than enough ETH in its buffers to handle the wave of withdrawal requests. The liquid staking protocol updated users through its Twitter account, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the time of writing, the Lido protocol has &asymp;440,000 ETH available in the protocol buffers. There could be large withdrawals this week. If so, some will be absorbed by this surplus.&rdquo;</p>

A Long Wait For Celsius&nbsp;
<p>Given the large number of ETH withdrawal requests from Lido, it is expected that there would be some impact on the network withdrawal queue. Lido holds a market share of nearly 30% and is the largest staking provider. This means that if requests continue to increase, Celsius could face a prolonged wait to get its hands on its stash of ETH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21Share, if unstaking requests exceed 10%, it could cause a significant number of validator exits and lead to longer withdrawal queues. There are speculations that Celsius could use the capital as part of its restructuring efforts or to repay some of its debts. Celsius owes around $4.7 billion to creditors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UK Treasury Committee released a report compelling the government to regulate retail crypto trading not as financial assets but as gambling instruments. </p>
<p>The House of Commons Treasury Committee published a report earlier today in which they want crypto trading and related investments assets to be held to the same standards as gambling. The 28-page report compiled by lawmakers from various parties argues that unbacked, mainstream crypto assets such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) should be regulated like gambling instruments.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have argued that fraudsters and money launderers&rsquo; potential use of crypto threatens consumers and economic stability. To that end, lawmakers have urged the UK government not to regard crypto trading as a financial instrument. The Committee further opined that the volatility associated with crypto trading is akin to sports betting rather than investing.</p>
<p>Harriet Baldwin, member of Parliament and Chair of the Treasury Committee, said: &nbsp;</p>

<p>With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.</p>

<p>The Committee further warned that regulating consumer crypto trading as a financial instrument will create a &lsquo;halo effect&rsquo;, making consumers think it is safe. According to a summary of the report:</p>

<p>The Committee is also concerned that regulating consumer crypto trading as a financial service &ndash; as proposed by the Government &ndash; will create a &lsquo;halo&rsquo; effect, leading consumers to believe this activity is safe and protected, when it is not.</p>

<p>However, the report acknowledges that blockchain technology, which underlies crypto, may be helpful to the UK&rsquo;s financial sector.</p>
Lawmakers Scramble to Regulate the Crypto Industry
<p>The Committee&rsquo;s report comes against the backdrop of the catastrophic events of 2022. A string of bankruptcies and liquidations cost investors billions, sent the overall crypto market spiralling, and highlighted the need for industry regulation. The United States has made little progress in improving its industry oversight, while the UK has taken steps to introduce a regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Recognising the dire need for industry oversight, the European Union (EU) has introduced its Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation which aims to give clarity and transparency to the industry. On Tuesday, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the EU unanimously voted to adopt laws and directives relating to the legislation, inching MiCA ever so close to taking effect in 2024.</p>

On Tuesday, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the EU unanimously voted to adopt laws and directives relating to the legislation, inching MiCA ever so close to taking effect in 2024.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ledger has come under stinging criticism from its community over its latest seed phrase recovery idea, with members taking to social media to voice their disapproval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ledger has pushed back against the criticism, stating that there are several inaccuracies.&nbsp;</p>
Ledger&rsquo;s New Seed Phrase Recovery Service&nbsp;
<p>Ledger&rsquo;s new seed phrase recovery service is called Ledger Recover and offers users added safeguards in case they misplace their seed phrase. The service was released in Ledger&rsquo;s latest firmware wallet and is a subscription service that gives users an additional layer of protection for their private keys. Ledger Recover uses a technique that divides a user&rsquo;s seed phrase into three encrypted fragments that are trusted with three custodians, namely Ledger, Coinover, and a third entity. A Ledger spokesperson elaborated on the same, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each fragment is stored by the parties on hardware security modules (HSMs) which are essentially super-powered Ledgers. It&rsquo;s what we use for Ledger Enterprise. Each fragment is useless on its own and can only be decrypted on a Ledger. They are completely safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Users can reconstruct the original see phrase once the separate fragments are combined and decrypted. The company also stated that the service is optional and that Ledger users don&rsquo;t have to use the service should they not wish to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to use it and can continue managing your recovery phrase yourself if that&rsquo;s why you bought a Ledger.&rdquo;</p>

So Where Is The Problem?&nbsp;
<p>While Ledger seems excited about the new update, the community reaction has been quite the opposite. This is because to use the service, users have to provide a national identity card or passport to use the service, and the users&rsquo; seed phrase would have to be trusted with &ldquo;external custodians.&rdquo; Several prominent crypto community members and Ledger wallet owners have taken to social media to criticize Ledger for what some users called a &ldquo;disaster waiting to happen.&rdquo; One Reddit user explained,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a disaster waiting to happen. I can&rsquo;t actually believe what I&rsquo;m reading; this seems absolutely crazy for a hardware wallet provider to encourage you to back up your seed phrase online AND give them your Passport/ID&mdash;especially one that has previously suffered a data breach!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ledger suffered a serious data leak in 2020, which exposed the phone numbers and physical addresses of over 300,000 customers. The breach also included the email addresses of over a million users. Others, such as investor Chris Dunn and crypto investor DCinvestor also referenced the infamous data leak while criticizing Ledger&rsquo;s new Seed Phrase Recovery Service. Dunn stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, they exposed mailing addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of their customers&hellip; And now they&rsquo;ve put a back door into seed phrases. It&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to @Ledger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DCinvestor also did not hold back, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reminder that several years ago, Ledger leaked the name and home addresses for all of their customers via a data breach. [T]he absolute last thing you want on their servers is your private key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polygon chief information security officer Mudit Gupta called it a horrendous idea and urged Ledger to refrain from enabling the new feature. In a Twitter thread, Gupta explained that the encrypted keys would be sent to three corporations that could reconstruct the private keys, leading to major security issues. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao replied to Gupta, adding,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the seed can leave the device now? Sounds like a different direction than &ldquo;your keys never leave the device.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tech lead triager at ImmuneFi, Adrian Hetman, called the new feature a bad security posture, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exposing your seed phrase and then allowing anyone with your ID or Passport to regain access to the locked funds is a bad security posture. ID theft is common, and that would expose crypto users to a new form of attack.&rdquo;</p>

Ledger Pushes Back Against Criticism&nbsp;
<p>Ledger has pushed back against the barrage of criticism against its new service, stating that there were &ldquo;lots of inaccuracies&rdquo; in the criticism it was facing and that there was no backdoor or security vulnerability. In response to Hetman, Ledger stated that the government ID is only one part of a complete process and does not pose a security risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We also have full liveness detection, where you use your camera, and it gives you randomized prompts that can&rsquo;t be faked or pre-recorded. This is reviewed by technology and also by humans to ensure a match before the recovery process is initiated. So, someone stealing your ID will not be able to recover your [Secret Recovery Phrase] SRP.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ledger called the new service a highly secure service that its Donjon team had tested. The Donjon team had previously detected breaches in a number of wallets, including TrustWallet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If you want more peace of mind or find recovery phrase management a barrier, you now have a highly secure service, tested by our Donjon team, which exposed breaches in TrustWallet and many other wallets, both software and hardware.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company also added that the new service is optional and that if a user does not wish to use it, they can choose not to enable it. It added that those wishing to use the service would have to initiate an approval process that uses the secure display of their Ledger wallet.</p>
