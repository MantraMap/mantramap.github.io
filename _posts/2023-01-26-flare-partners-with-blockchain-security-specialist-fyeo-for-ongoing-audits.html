<p>Dubai, UAE, 26th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Flare is pleased to announce an official partnership with blockchain security specialist, FYEO. The firm will perform ongoing security audits of Flare&rsquo;s codebases, providing actionable feedback to support safer smart contract development and help to minimize risk for all users of the network.</p>
<p>Rigorous professional auditing and testing are an important part of Flare&rsquo;s blockchain security strategy. Alongside stringent internal testing measures, ongoing code audits help to establish a level of security assurance to application developers and users on the network. </p>
<p>Flare Co-Founder &amp; CEO Hugo Philion said, &ldquo;We are building our protocols with auditor reviews initiated from close to day one. We believe this guarantees a safer outcome than an auditor reviewing an entire code base at the end of development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to continuous auditing from partners including FYEO, Flare also employs rigorous testing with testnets and a Canary network called Songbird. The Canary network is a live but more experimental version of Flare (similar to Kusama&rsquo;s relationship to Polkadot) where Flare can test their protocols. The network advises application developers and builders to do the same. Flare recognizes that risk minimization from both an auditing and testnet perspective is crucial to building reputational trust amongst users. </p>
<p>In the words of Flare Co-Founder, Hugo Philion, "Our game as an organization within the industry is to mitigate the risk in blockchain such that people feel comfortable to use it. As a result of that, the usage can increase substantially&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Tammy Kahn, Co-CEO of FYEO, said, &ldquo;FYEO could not be more aligned with this vision for supporting adoption through user risk minimization, and look forward to our continuous work with Flare as it expands its presence as a leader of decentralized innovation.&rdquo;</p>
