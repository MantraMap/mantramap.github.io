<h2>FDIC: Cryptos and Climate Top Risk List for Banks in 2023</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies present &#8220;novel and complex risks&#8221; that are difficult to assess amid recent volatility, according to the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/risk-review/2023-risk-review/2023-risk-review-full.pdf">report</a>. Growth in crypto assets corresponded with more banks expressing interest in crypto activities last year. However, the sector then experienced a crash that exposed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">vulnerabilities</a>. The FDIC is closely monitoring crypto activities at banks and said additional guidance is likely.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of the difficulty in assessing these risks arises from the dynamic nature of crypto-assets, the crypto marketplace, and the rapid pace of innovation,” the report said. “Some of the key risks associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants include those related to fraud, legal uncertainties, misleading or inaccurate representations and disclosures, risk management practices exhibiting a lack of maturity and robustness, and platform and other operational vulnerabilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news follows a </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-by-fed-and-fdic-reveal-vulnerabilities-behind-2-major-us-bank-failures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Signature Bank’s (SBNY) collapse that discusses the risks involved with crypto assets and the FTX failure. In the SBNY report, a sharp uptick in withdrawals of uninsured deposits due to liquidity risk management is prominently highlighted. The FDIC delved deeply into the chaos within the crypto industry, pinpointing it and the FTX collapse as a significant factor in SBNY&#8217;s downfall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the FDIC claims U.S. banks face increasing physical risks from alleged </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-president-christine-lagarde-blames-climate-change-for-europes-torrid-inflation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issues as severe weather causes more damage. The FDIC highlights that t</span>here were 18 natural disasters in 2022 that each caused over $1 billion in damages, the third most expensive year on record.</p>
<p>“Increased frequency and severity of climate and weather events present challenges and emerging risks to the banking industry,” the report said. “Changes in climate conditions, including [the] increasing frequency and intensity of severe climate and weather events and other natural disasters, will likely pose additional risks.”</p>

The move came despite the global market cap falling marginally lower as of the time of writing. Toncoin was another notable mover, rising for a sixth-straight day.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) surged higher on Tuesday, as sentiment in the token has remained largely bullish in recent days.</p>
<p>SOL/USD peaked at $25.24 during today’s session, which follows up from a low of $24.35 to start the week.</p>
<p>This climb saw solana trade at its highest point since July 29, when price reached a high of $25.39.</p>

<p>The move came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Should upward momentum continue to intensify, the next target for traders will likely be around the $26.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $24.82.</p>

<h2>Toncoin (TON)</h2>
<p>Toncoin (TON) was also in the green in today’s session, as the price climbed for a sixth-consecutive session.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1.42 to start the week, TON/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1.49 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of today’s surge in price, toncoin moved to its strongest level since July 23, and closer to a ceiling of $1.50.</p>

<p>Similar to solana above, the rally came as the 10-day and 25-day moving averages neared an upwards cross.</p>
<p>One area of concern for bulls is the current reading of the RSI indicator, which is tracking at 66.91.</p>
<p>This is the highest area it has reached in the coin’s history, meaning it is greatly overbought, with bears potentially waiting to take advantage of this.</p>

This move closely follows the appointment of John Guedry as the company&#8217;s overseer, bolstered by a designated committee to steer the restructuring process.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Custodian Prime Trust Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</h2>
<p>Despite the chaos, Prime Trust pledges to operate with transparency, prioritizing its stakeholders&#8217; best interests. The push for bankruptcy protection marks a new episode in an ongoing drama ignited by claims of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-firm-coinbits-suspends-operations-amidst-custodian-prime-trusts-financial-woes/">financial instability</a> and failures to process customer withdrawals.</p>
<p>As the gravity of Prime Trust&#8217;s monetary woes intensified, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division stepped in, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nevadas-financial-watchdog-seeks-receivership-of-crypto-custodian-prime-trust-amidst-insolvency-concerns/">signaling its plan to dismantle</a> Prime Trust and seize its holdings. Under a directive from the Eighth Judicial District Court in Nevada, John Guedry, flanked by John Wilcox and Michael Wyse, will helm the restructuring committee.</p>
<p>This panel, dubbed the “special committee,” wields the power to navigate Prime Trust&#8217;s Chapter 11 endeavors. Upcoming on Prime Trust&#8217;s agenda is the submission of multiple proposals to the Bankruptcy Court. These proposals are designed to refine the assessment of all viable approaches, potentially encompassing the sale of company assets and ongoing operations.</p>

<p>These deliberations emerge from Prime Trust&#8217;s recent ordeals, notably its ties with crypto entities like Stably, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-firms-face-turmoil-as-prime-trust-fallout-causes-service-disruptions-and-concerns/">encountered disruptions</a> due to their affiliations with the beleaguered custodian. Notably, Stably had to hit pause on most of its offerings, attributing it to Prime Trust&#8217;s fiscal setbacks. Moreover, a notable motion from Prime Trust seeks to uphold standard salary and perks for its existing staff members.</p>
<p>Given the mounting concerns over Prime Trust&#8217;s fiscal health and looming debts, the emphasis is on safeguarding stakeholder interests. The custodian&#8217;s path has been marred by obstacles, ranging from purported inaccessibility of legacy digital currency wallets to facing charges of neglecting fiduciary duties. Documentation from the <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X274/12458/PLEADINGS/1245808152380000000027.pdf">Chapter 11 submission</a> pinpoints Prime Trust&#8217;s debts in the ballpark of $100 million to $500 million.</p>

Sales rose by 0.7%, better than the 0.4% expected, and this comes following a 0.2% increase in June. Ethereum also remained unchanged prior to the data.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was trading in the red for the majority of the day, as price consolidated prior to the release of U.S. retail sales data.</p>
<p>After peaking at $29,660.25 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to a low of $29,272.35 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Since moving above $30,000 on August 8, the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency has mostly trended sideways.</p>

<p>One reason for a lack of direction appears to be due to the relative strength index (RSI) tracking between a support and resistance of its own.</p>
<p>The index is currently at a reading of 47.57, and has mostly moved between a floor at 47.00, and ceiling at 49.00 in recent days.</p>
<p>For bulls, a breakout above the 49.00 zone will also likely be the straw needed to break the camel&#x2019;s back.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) has remained largely unchanged in the past few days, rising by 0.11% in the past week.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD bottomed out at $1,837.21 so far during today&#x2019;s session, which is almost $20.00 lower than Monday&#x2019;s high.</p>
<p>Price has mostly consolidated around a support point of $1,830 in recent days, however the prospect of a moving average crossover is keeping bullish hopes alive.</p>

<p>The 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages are on the cusp of an upwards crossover, which could likely send prices above $1,900.</p>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, there will first need to be a breakout above a ceiling on the RSI indicator for this to take place.</p>
<p>On this occasion the resistance point is at 47.00, and the index is currently tracking at 45.23.</p>

However, 2023 has painted a different picture, positioning cryptocurrency as one of the best-performing investments. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market capitalization rebounded from a low of $780.9 billion to a staggering $1.2198 trillion. Amid this resurgence, LBank, after a few years of dormancy, has announced the reboot of its IEO.

<p>With Lbank&#8217;s IEO making a comback, let&#8217;s dive deep into it&#8217;s historical performance to gauge it&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p class="a"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Historical Gains of LBank IEO &#8211; 8 IEOs with an Average Surge of 1274%</span></p>
<p class="a"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Here&#8217;s a breakdown of LBank&#8217;s past eight IEOs and their respective gains:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Key Insights from the Data:</strong></p>
<p>Extreme Performers: VEN stands out remarkably with an opening surge of 100% and a jaw-dropping peak surge of 5300%. DBC, with its 300% opening and 2096% peak, also highlights the potential of high return for investors when the right project is picked.</p>
<p>Steady Climbers: Projects like BLOC, SEER, and INK might not have the most impressive opening surges, but their peak surges underline the importance of holding onto investments and the potential for long-term gains.</p>
<p>Consistent Performers: Both CMT and DDD had modest opening surges but still managed to deliver reasonable peak surges. These indicate that even projects that start with a quieter entry can offer profitable opportunities.</p>
<p>Risky Endeavors: While the data predominantly showcases successes, it&#8217;s also essential to note projects like INK and DDD. Their minimal to zero opening surges serve as a reminder of the risks inherent in IEO investments.</p>
<p>This data also showcases a strong correlation between the initial surge and peak surge. In simpler terms, projects with an impressive opening usually fare well in the long run. From the data, it&#8217;s evident that investing in LBank&#8217;s IEOs can provide returns in the short term. Holding onto these investments for an extended period might amplify the gains further, as exemplified by the metaverse project SAND.</p>
<p><strong>LBank&#8217;s Current Market Stance:</strong></p>
<p>While LBank carries a notable legacy, it is essential to consider contemporary metrics when assessing its present standing. According to the H1 report from CoinMarketCap, LBank is featured among the top five global exchanges, an indication of its continued relevance and adaptability in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Holding a 4.6% market share in spot trading volume, it&#8217;s intriguing to observe their strategic emphasis on MEME coins. This focus, often seen as a blend of calculated risk and innovative market positioning, distinguishes LBank from many of its counterparts.</p>

<p>To conclude, based on the available data and recent market performances, one can argue that LBank remains a significant player in the exchange arena. As they reboot their IEO, it might be a space to watch for investors keen on exploring fresh avenues.</p>

In a thorough examination penned by Theo Baker for the Stanford Daily, the details of SBF&#8217;s multifaceted relationship with one of the globe&#8217;s most respected academic institutions are unraveled.</strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Tangled Ties With Stanford Law Unveiled Amid Legal Turmoil</h2>
<p>Per a <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/08/13/s-b-f-is-leaving-campus-but-stanfords-ties-to-his-case-are-deeper-than-previously-known/">detailed account</a> in the Stanford Daily, SBF was on the calendar to enlighten the minds of Stanford&#8217;s students and faculty on tech ethics during the winter quarter. The excitement was palpable, yet the community was stunned by a sudden twist in fate. November 2022 marked the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">downfall</a> of SBF&#8217;s crypto kingdom, followed by the U.S. government levying charges against the ex-FTX leader. Following extradition from the Bahamas, SBF secured bail only to find himself confined under house arrest.</p>
<p>The residence in question belonged to SBF&#8217;s parents, Stanford Law School (SLS) professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried. The Stanford Daily report says professor Bankman&#8217;s connection to the case has garnered special notice, considering his esteemed reputation within both the legal field and Stanford&#8217;s scholarly circles. The entire episode has not only raised eyebrows but also ignited spirited discussions on campus, as described in the Stanford Daily&#8217;s missive.</p>
<p>Last week, the twist intensified when SBF&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-boss-sam-bankman-fried-in-custody-bail-revoked-remanded-to-jail/">bail was revoked</a>. This was after former SLS dean Larry Kramer and Stanford professor Andreas Paepcke <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stanford-alumni-revealed-as-co-signers-of-ftx-co-founders-250m-bond/">stepped in to reinforce</a> the bail bond for the beleaguered crypto mogul when he extradited to the United States. <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/author/tabaker/">Theo Baker</a>&#8216;s exposé reveals that SBF&#8217;s parents, Bankman and Fried, have been fixtures in SLS for &#8220;decades,&#8221; and it spotlights an atypical $10 million payment from SBF to his father in January 2022. The report delineates the $10 million as a loan, although FTX creditors remain mystified by the absence of a loan agreement.</p>
<p>The Stanford Daily reporter highlights how Forbes and other media outlets <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-bankman-fried-is-allegedly-using-alameda-funds-to-pay-for-legal-defense/">suggest</a> that these funds are earmarked for SBF&#8217;s legal defense. The Stanford Daily&#8217;s coverage additionally discloses that despite being embroiled in his son&#8217;s legal turmoil, Bankman has &#8220;continued to play an active role at the school.&#8221; Allegedly, he is even slated to interview a job candidate in September, as confirmed by a schedule inspected by Stanford Daily. Stanford&#8217;s officials, however, have maintained silence on the matter, declining to comment on the case and its connection to the institution.</p>

<p>In a contrasting note, Stephanie Ashe, a spokesperson for SLS, did offer a statement to the Stanford Daily journalist, emphasizing that “as a matter of policy, Stanford University and the law school do not take positions on the outside activities of our individual faculty members, nor do we discuss personnel issues or other confidential matters.” Meanwhile, from his confinement in jail, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-heads-brooklyn-jail-notorious-poor-conditions-2023-08-14/#:~:text=In%20a%20letter%20on%20Monday,Fried%27s%20first%20time%20behind%20bars.">reports</a> that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal team has sought depression medications for SBF from the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn.</p>

It involves locating the wallet file and cracking the password, using specialized tools such as those developed by the digital assets recovery experts at KeychainX. Once the password is recovered, the wallet can be decrypted and the private key imported to access the stored <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.</b></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Can an Old GETH Wallet Be Recovered?</h2>
<div class="content" tabindex="0">
<div class="ac-container ac-adaptiveCard">
<div class="ac-textBlock">
<p>Geth (go-ethereum) is an execution client which has been a core part of Ethereum since its very inception. If you have an old wallet that has been lying around for years and you can&#x2019;t access it anymore, due to a bug or a missing password, there is still a chance to recover the assets locked inside. Just follow the detailed instructions in this <a href="https://keychainx.medium.com/dinosaur-crypto-8b15f249dd91">article from KeychainX</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is to check the authenticity of the wallet by opening it with a general text editor and checking for the string address. This can be pasted into etherscan.io with a 0x added in front to see if the address still holds any <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>
<p>If you have the computer but are unable to find the wallet file, there are various locations to look for it depending on your operating system. Once the file is located and you are confident that there is some <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> stored inside it, it&#x2019;s time to move to the next step.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cracking a GETH Wallet Password</h2>
<p>Create a text file with the most common passwords you have been using in the past. Then, head to Hashcat open source cracking software and get Hashcat. You can use Jack The Ripper (ethereum2john.py) tool to extract the hash.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s important to note that GETH uses strong encryption and using a GPU card will not help. You should have a strong CPU, although speed is very slow (usually 15-20 password tries per second). KeychainX has developed a custom-built tool that speeds up 30x compared to Hashcat, and in some instances even 100x.</p>
<p>Once you get the password to your file, you will be able to decrypt the wallet and import the private key to a new wallet. If you find the whole process overwhelming, you can find help in the Hashcat forum. With these steps, you should be able to recover your old GETH wallet and access your <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> once again. And if you still need someone to help you with the process, don&#x2019;t hesitate to reach out to KeychainX.</p>

Milei&#8217;s government plan contemplates reducing the political apparatus in Argentina and axing the central bank, which would be closed after the dollarization process.</strong></p>
<h2>Javier Milei Wins Argentine Primaries Sparking Dollarization Talks</h2>
<p>Libertarian presidential candidate Javier Milei <a href="https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202308/636966-elecciones-resultados.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won</a> the primary elections held in Argentina on Sunday, scoring more than 30% of the popular vote. While these elections serve just for selecting the candidates from each political party, the process allows observers and analysts to speculate on the outcome of the next elections, slated to be held on October 22.</p>
<p>The victory of Milei, considered by many as a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/argentina-primaries-primary-paso-elections-a4fdbe888b7f561c3833ba4eca7e5d72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far-right-leaning</a> candidate, has sparked talks about his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-debates-dollarization-in-the-midst-of-rampant-devaluation-and-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government plan</a>, which includes reducing the size of the state by cutting several ministries and, most significantly, the dollarization of the Argentine economy.</p>
<p>Milei&#8217;s dollarization <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-debates-dollarization-in-the-midst-of-rampant-devaluation-and-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">program</a> would include the conversion to dollars of all deposits and reserves of private and public institutions and the closure of the Central Bank of Argentina. He has stated this is one of the ways to &#8220;end the scam of monetary emission to cover for the treasury and end inflation, given that Argentine politicians are thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The economy has also reacted to Milei&#8217;s win, with the central bank devaluing the official exchange rate of the Argentine peso to 350 units per dollar, while the parallel &#8220;blue&#8221; exchange rate reached record highs of almost 700 pesos per dollar, nearly doubling the official rate. Retail stores have also removed prices from imported appliances and other products to protect themselves from losing money in any sale.</p>

<h2>Experts Talk Dollarization</h2>
<p>The outcome of the primaries has economists and politicians analyzing the possible effects of dollarization on the Argentine economy. In June, Milei <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/presidential-candidate-javier-milei-claims-he-has-the-funds-to-dollarize-argentina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that he had secured the funds to dollarize Argentina, avoiding disclosing the identities of the third parties involved in such a deal due to the existence of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).</p>
<p>Former Economy Minister Jorge Lenikov <a href="https://www.ambito.com/economia/que-significa-dolarizar-un-pais-la-medida-economica-mas-discutida-javier-milei-n5794501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> the dollarization plan, stating that this would leave Argentina without the tools to apply its monetary policy, leaving these to be enforced by the U.S. Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>However, some have also supported Milei&#8217;s vision. Emilio Ocampo, another Argentine economist, believes that dollarization is the &#8220;second best&#8221; option for the country, as he considers that an independent and competent central bank is unattainable in Argentina.</p>

Such a system, when completed, could ostensibly allow the digital yuan to reach more countries in trade settlements, chipping away at the world dominance of the U.S. dollar and bypassing established sanctions systems.</strong></p>
<h2>Mbridge Project Worries Observers</h2>
<p>The Mbridge project, a <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp59.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure</a> that would leverage central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to move value in seconds, has American and European observers worried about the possible implications of its completion and implementation. While Mbridge is still in its construction and prototyping stages, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-09/china-s-digital-yuan-mbridge-plan-challenges-7-trillion-dollar-dominance?sref=Yg3sQEZ2&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> it might have a minimum working product ready by year-end, according to four people with knowledge of the subject.</p>
<p>The system, which is being built with the participation of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), would allow the digital yuan to further its reach as a trade settlement currency and challenge the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance in the global payments arena.</p>
<p>Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is concerned with Mbridge&#8217;s implementation, as undisclosed sources allegedly told Bloomberg that the institution held meetings to discuss the possibility of bringing it under the control of an undefined international organization.</p>

<h2>Bringing CBDCs a Step Further</h2>
<p>Experts fear that Mbridge could upend the traditional international finance system, as it would allow payments to move beyond the limits and sanctions established by countries like the U.S.</p>
<p>The system would use its own blockchain-based rails, sidestepping restrictions relying on organizations like the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which provides the standard messaging system for cross-border payments. While Mbridge only encompasses China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and UAE, the total goods exchanged by these nations was $564 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>According to statements from the Bank of Thailand, Mbridge would be far superior to traditional payment rails, allowing settlements to be processed in seconds rather than in days. The bank also hinted at the possible addition of more nations to the project, stating that it would &#8220;offer more benefit to end-users and commercial banks if there are more participating jurisdictions to join.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russia, a nation facing sanctions from Western countries, is on the verge of starting a pilot test for its own CBDC, the digital ruble, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-reports-13-banks-will-participate-in-digital-ruble-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involving</a> 13 commercial banks. The Bank of Russia is also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-russia-discusses-digital-ruble-integration-with-other-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing</a> the integration of the digital ruble with other friendly nations to complete cross-border payments and settlements.</p>

The global investment bank&#8217;s economists also expect the Fed officials to forego hiking rates at their upcoming meeting. &#8220;We are penciling in 25 basis points of cuts per quarter but are uncertain about the pace,&#8221; Goldman said.</strong></p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs&#8217; Interest Rate Cut Prediction</h2>
<p>Global investment bank Goldman Sachs has predicted that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in Q2 next year. Goldman economists, including Jan Hatzius and David Mericle, detailed in a note Sunday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target, not by a recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Normalization is not a particularly urgent motivation for cutting, and for that reason, we also see a significant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady,” the economists described. They noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are penciling in 25 basis points of cuts per quarter but are uncertain about the pace … We expect the funds rate to eventually stabilize at 3%-3.25%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Goldman Sachs is not the only one forecasting a rate cut in the second quarter of 2024. Bank of America, for example, said in June that it expects the Fed to begin cutting interest rates in May next year.</p>
<p>Regarding further interest rate hikes, the Goldman economists anticipate that the Fed will not raise interest rates at its upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting next month. They expect Federal Reserve officials to come to the conclusion at their November meeting “that the core inflation trend has slowed enough to make a final hike unnecessary.” The Fed&#8217;s aggressive campaign to combat inflation has pushed the benchmark interest rate to 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level since 2001.</p>
<p>Fed governors, including Michelle Bowman, believe that additional interest rate hikes may be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-governor-hints-at-more-interest-rate-hikes/">needed</a> to get inflation on a path down to the Fed’s 2% target. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said after the Fed&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">latest rate hike</a> that prevailing economic conditions suggest that monetary policy will likely need to be restrictive for longer, emphasizing: &#8220;We’re prepared to further tighten if that’s appropriate.&#8221;</p>
