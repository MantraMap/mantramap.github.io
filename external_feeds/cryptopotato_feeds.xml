			            <description><![CDATA[Lens Protocol's latest version has introduced a blocking feature for its users. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aave Companies announced the launch of the second iteration of Lens Protocol on July 17th, designed to serve as a social layer for Web3. The new version aims to bring even greater control to builders and integrators as well as people exploring Web3-powered experiences.</p>
<p>The first version of Lens Protocol was purposely built and launched without a user interface. The V2, on the other hand, comes with a codebase that&#8217;s entirely rewritten, refactored, and optimized.</p>
<h2>Lens V2: Spotlight on Monetization</h2>
<p>The main goal of such a move is to allow easy composability and configurability that delivers an improved user experience, support new social use cases, and shared monetization opportunities that benefit all Web3 social networking stakeholders be it users, creatives, applications, and algorithms, not just individually but collectively as a ecosystem.</p>
<p>The monetization layer now expands to encompass all Web3 applications and profiles, creating opportunities among individuals, applications, algorithms, and protocols. Users, applications, and algorithms are now integral components of the monetization chain, allowing them to mutually reward and incentivize collaborative work, fostering the spirit of collaboration within web3.</p>
<p>Following the development, Stani Kulechov, Founder of Lens Protocol, commented,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Lens Protocol V2 takes decentralized social media and monetization opportunities to a new level. Providing maximum flexibility for builders, V2 enables new types of social engagements and monetization relationships, where all stakeholders can share in the value of social networks – both individually and collectively as an ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Other Features</h2>
<p>In terms of new features, V2 will introduce &#8216;open actions&#8217; that seek to enable developers to deploy new activities on Lens, expanding the different ways that people can interact with content and creators in Web3. These actions can be integrated into both existing and future consumer-facing applications.</p>
<p>Lens Protocol V2 adopts an open model, rewarding valuable actions at each stage of the value chain to establish a sustainable ecosystem for content creators, applications, algorithms, and even external protocols.</p>
<p>The latest iteration has also implemented a new standard known as ERC-6551 for user profiles. This standard allows Lens profiles to possess their own wallets, housing ERC-721 tokens and other non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Consequently, ERC-6551-powered Lens profiles enable NFTs the capability to execute actions.</p>
<p>In a bid to ensure trust and security, V2 will let users block a profile from commenting, mirroring, collecting, or conducting any open action.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Major altcoins saw another strong correction as the global crypto market cap shrank by 0.5% over the past day. Solana plunged 4% over the past 24 hours, while Cardano fell close to 2% over the same period.</p>
<p>The crypto market is facing a choppy week ahead as the threat of an SEC appeal against the recent Ripple ruling becomes more likely.</p>
<p>Despite the bearish conditions, several tokens remain bullish due to their high utility. Launchpad XYZ is one such project that has recently surpassed the $1 million mark in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261052" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="307" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12-300x153.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-12-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Solana and Cardano Plummet As Ripple’s Post-Win Enthusiasm Dampens</strong></h2>
<p>Ripple’s landmark win against the SEC provided a strong bullish boost to the entire crypto market.</p>
<p>In a watershed ruling, district judge Analisa Torres stated that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP tokens did not meet the criteria set by the Howey test and thus did not make the token a security.</p>
<p>The decision resulted in a close to 100% surge for XRP, with the token trading as high as $0.95 at one point &#8211; it has since corrected to $0.738.</p>
<p>The ruling also resulted in double-digit pumps in other major altcoins that have been labelled as securities in the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<p>Solana in particular reached its highest price mark since the disastrous FTX bankruptcy in November of last year. The token is currently trading at $26.9 and is up 30% over the past week, bringing its total gains to 70% over the last month.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-19.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261053" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-19.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="329" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-19.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-19-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-19-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Similarly, Cardano is also up 10% in the weekly time frame as the ADA token is trading at $0.31.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-19.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261054" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-19.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="333" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-19.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-19-300x166.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-19-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Cardano and Solana’s surge can be attributed to the widespread belief that Ripple’s victory will make it easier for other tokens to prove their non-security status. Expert crypto analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/thecryptolark/status/1679602044473311236?s=46" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lark Davis</a> believes that if XRP is not a security, then most other major altcoins aren’t as well.</p>
<p>However, several legal experts now believe that this celebration may have been premature. Both ConsenSys lawyer Bill Hughes and litigator Bryan Jacotout are of the opinion that the <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanjacoutot/status/1679539619312853028?s=46" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SEC will likely appeal the district court’s ruling</a>.</p>
<p>Other experts are also noting that the recent ruling did find that <a href="https://twitter.com/jvallee2000/status/1679978131908890626?s=46" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ripple violated the Securities Act</a> when they sold the tokens to institutional investors.</p>
<p>Even in the case of programmatic sales, Ripple won because Judge Torres factored in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-13/what-does-ripple-xrp-ruling-in-sec-case-mean-for-crypto" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lack of mainstream knowledge</a> of the crypto market in the early days of XRP. Several other newer tokens may not receive such a benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2><strong>Which Tokens Can Outperform The Crypto Market?</strong></h2>
<p>The crypto market remains in the doldrums, and an SEC appeal can result in strong downward pressure.</p>
<p>Investors are now looking for presale tokens that can display bullish price surges despite the bearish sentiment. Launchpad XYZ is emerging as a top contender it has raised over $1.1m and continues to rise.</p>
<h2><strong>New Web3 Portal Launchpad XYZ Turns Heads as Token Nears $1.5 Million</strong></h2>
<p>The crypto market is extremely volatile and can be overwhelming for newbies and natives alike. However, the <a href="https://bs_010f7b2f.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=solana-and-cardano-prices-slide-but-launchpad-xyz-raises-1-million" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ</a> ecosystem is offering a suite of powerful trading products that can help users combat the complexities of the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261055" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="359" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15-300x179.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-15-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Investors have been quick to recognize the project’s high real-world utility as it has already raised $1.1 million in the presale and is well on its way to hitting the $1.5 million mark.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ is carefully designed to help users succeed in crypto trading while also offering them maximum learning opportunities. For example, the Terminal Edge platform will help them gain valuable market insights with the help of sentiment analysis and the latest crypto news. Beginners can also get to know the trading setup of other expert traders.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Launchpad Quotient will make sure users do not miss out on the next big investment opportunity by ranking crypto assets across 400 data points.</p>
<p>The all-in-one Web3 portal also offers other tools such as its own Web3 wallet, premium NFT marketplace, a decentralized exchange, a sophisticated Terminal trading engine, etc.</p>
<p>The $LPX token is currently priced at $0.0445 but will surge significantly to $0.0565 at listing. Investors can purchase the token through bank cards or by swapping ETH or USDT tokens.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin investment products have pulled in $742 million in the past month.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investment products offering crypto exposure have surged in popularity since last month, attracting net inflows of $137 million over the last week alone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, trading volumes for such products have soared beyond their yearly average, totalling $2.3 billion last week.</p>
<h2>Investors Return to Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Per Coinshares’ <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-140-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-9f970fceec21" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">weekly report</a>, inflows into digital asset investment products totalled $742 million over the past 4 weeks.</p>
<p>That’s the greatest investment rush into the sector since Q4 2021 &#8211; when Bitcoin (BTC) tapped its all-time high of $69,000. Indeed, virtually all investment interest appears to be in Bitcoin specifically, which absorbed $140 million of inflows last week.</p>
<p>“Bitcoin saw inflows totalling US$140m, comprising 99% of all inflows,” read the report. “Short bitcoin investment products saw a 12th week of outflows of US$3.2m.”</p>
<p>Bitcoin has traded above $30,000 since last month after <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-can-transcend-the-dollar-and-other-currencies-blackrock-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock</a> – the world’s largest asset manager – entered the race to list a Bitcoin spot ETF in the United States. The move not only signalled legitimacy for an oft-criticized asset class but gave investors hope that such a product might actually get approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Many investors are bullish that an ETF for Bitcoin could attract a wave of capital into the asset from investors unable or unwilling to purchase actual coins on an exchange. According to CoinShares, most capital going to crypto investment funds last week went to ProShares ETFs – funds backed by crypto futures contracts, rather than real coins or tokens.</p>
<p>“Regionally, the inflows were focussed almost solely on North America, with inflows of US$109m and US$28m in the US and Canada respectively,” the report stated. “While minor outflows were seen in Europe with the exception of minor inflows in Switzerland.”</p>
<p>Canada was the first country in the world to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF. Lawmakers in the region recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/canadian-lawmakers-publish-report-defending-and-supporting-crypto-coinbase-approves/" data-wpel-link="internal">published</a> a set of digital asset policy recommendations calling for the protection of the users’ right to hold their own crypto.</p>
<h2>Altcoin Interest Still Flat</h2>
<p>While Ether (ETH) rose alongside Bitcoin since last month, institutional interest in the asset isn’t quite visible. In fact, the crypto suffered minor outflows of $2 million last week from digital asset funds, making it the asset with the most outflows year-to-date.</p>
<p>“Altcoins, Solana, Polygon and Litecoin saw minor inflows of between US$0.5m, US$0.5m and US$.3m respectively,” the report added</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) suffered last month after the SEC alleged that both assets were unregistered securities in its lawsuit against Coinbase. However, a positive outcome for <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-surpasses-bitcoin-in-terms-of-trading-volume-following-ripple-v-sec-win/" data-wpel-link="internal">XRP</a> in Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC last week has such coins making a comeback.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[ZachXBT has exposed another remorseless crypto and NFT scammer and is sharing information with victims to take possible legal action against the culprit.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular on-chain sleuth ZachXBT has unmasked another crypto scammer responsible for stealing millions of dollars in digital assets using sophisticated phishing attacks.</p>
<p>The thief’s targets included the discord services for DeFi projects such as Orbiter Finance and Pika Protocol.</p>
<h2>Impersonation and Confiscation</h2>
<p>In a Twitter thread <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1680918931442368515" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">published</a> on Monday, ZachXBT explained that the attacker, Soup (aka Dan) enacted his scam by impersonating Luke Hamlton – an employee for the crypto media outlet Decrypt.</p>
<p>In collaboration with other Scammers, Soup lured members of various crypto project teams into joining a fake Decrypt Discord server. He then tricked them into submitting KYC information as part of a fake application and interview process, only to later embed phishing attack in an “elaborate attempt to steal their Discord token.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ Soup creates fake <a href="https://twitter.com/decryptmedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@decryptmedia</a> websites and poses as Luke Hamilton (a real Decrypt employee)</p>
<p>He works with other scammers to approach team members of crypto projects to trick them into joining a fake Decrypt Discord server in an elaborate attempt to steal their Discord token <a href="https://t.co/Oe6mX2zFk1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/Oe6mX2zFk1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1680918940019556353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A Discord token is an alphanumeric string acting representing a user’s login credentials, giving them access to any servers they own or are a part of.</p>
<p>The scammer compromised the Pika Protocol Discord server on May 30, 2023, posting a malicious link in the announcements channel, allowing them to <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2162b6caa174b90416090bd4a87e7d08f7027c48" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">steal</a> $220,000 in crypto. In a private DM, Dan admitted to receiving 15% of the scammers’ profits.</p>
<p>The following day, the scammers attacked Orbiter Finance, using a malicious link to steal another $760,000. Soup confessed to receiving 30% of the stolen funds, of which 7.5 ETH was identified in one of his <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2162b6caa174b90416090bd4a87e7d08f7027c48" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">known addresses</a>.</p>
<p>Soup spent some of the proceeds from his crimes on exclusive five-figure Roblox items.</p>
<p>ZachXBT added that Soup was involved in the theft of Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC NFT #21080 last year. In collaboration with his scamming partner, Faint, the two minted a fake MAYC and offered to trade it to a victim for the real MAYC, which the victim <a href="https://twitter.com/LakeShowTJ/status/1571506608861249538" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">accepted</a>.</p>
<p>Soup also stole Cryptopunk #6983 in January of this year.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Soup admits to having profited $1M himself while his partners have profited even more,” wrote ZachXBT. “He seems to show little remorse for his actions after financially harming projects and people.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Connection to Blue</h2>
<p>ZachXBT was able to track down one of Soup’s addresses after the scammer accidentally revealed it when proving that the ENS address purplelobster.eth was controlled by Blue – another scammer <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/youtuber-turned-nft-scammer-on-chain-sleuth-investigates-1-5-million-crypto-thief/" data-wpel-link="internal">exposed</a> by ZachXBT last week. Blue sent soup $25 worth of ETH at the time.</p>
<p>Blue, a former YouTuber turned NFT scammer, also had connections to Monkey Drainer, known for stealing over $24 million in digital collectibles and boasting about his thefts online. In some of his recent phishing attacks, Blue took, over $200,000 in crypto and NFTs from addresses yancy.eth and LoveMake.eth.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s disgusting to see these phishing scammers show zero remorse and spend the funds on tasteless items,” said ZachXBT at the time.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto miners pivot to AI to ensure survival but challenges lie ahead. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous, making its presence felt across various sectors. Gradually infiltrating every aspect of human activity, this buzzword, although not entirely new, has captivated the minds of both seasoned tech gurus and novices alike.</p>
<p>The integration of the digital asset space and AI was inevitable. Industry players are actively exploring innovative approaches to integrate these two technologies. Hence, the pivot of crypto miners to this newfound tech darling is not surprising.</p>
<p>Miners have realized that AI-powered solutions hold the promise of addressing some of our most critical challenges. As we enter the next decade, it is abundantly clear that the digital future and AI are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>The ongoing AI boom is revitalizing the prospects of cryptocurrency miners, which have been reeling from the humbling market crash last year. This strategic shift has garnered its unique moniker: Mining 2.0</p>
<h2>Crypto Miners Riding the AI Wave</h2>
<p>Prominent players in the crypto mining industry are actively <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-says-artificial-intelligence-ai-is-a-mega-force-in-todays-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">seeking</a> greener pastures in the AI sector. One such is Hut8 which is expanding its horizon by venturing into non-mining services while simultaneously investing in high-performance data centers to cater to the growing demands of AI and computing requirements.</p>
<p>In a conversation with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, Hut8’s Erin Dermer said the company is “uniquely qualified to deliver on AI clients’ intensive workloads.”</p>
<p>Hut8 purchased five traditional high-performance computing data centers last year. Shortly thereafter, it moved some of its GPUs and supporting servers, previously mining Ethereum, into those data centers to perform VFX rendering and machine learning for its customers, primarily in the gaming and entertainment industries. Hut8 also revealed with clients, including XYZ AI, to deliver the computing power to support their text-to-graphic generative AI requirements.</p>
<p>Dermer said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are very excited by the promise of AI and have been providing the computing infrastructure to deliver these high-demand computing services for some time. While we are still in the early days of AI adoption, we believe that whether we are mining Bitcoin or providing high-performance computing services, the common thread is in the computing infrastructure, and Hut 8 is actively pursuing both lines of business.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>As lucrative as it seems, it&#8217;s important to note that AI and crypto mining have distinct sets of requirements.</p>
<p>While crypto mining primarily relies on powerful computational resources and specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical problems, that&#8217;s not the case with AI, which typically emphasizes data processing, machine learning algorithms, and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>Therefore, although both fields can be profitable, it&#8217;s crucial to recognize and address the unique demands and challenges associated with each, including the need for tailored infrastructure, expertise, and investment strategies.</p>
<p>According to Bitcoin miner Xive’s CEO and co-founder, Didar Bekbauov, &#8220;only altcoin miners can switch to AI computations now&#8221; because they use GPUs &#8211; which not only help in crypto mining but can also be used for the computational workloads needed to train generative AI systems.</p>
<p>While speaking with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, Bekbauov shed some light on the subject and said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Almost 99% of all crypto mining is Bitcoin mining, where we use application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners. They can’t be used for any other purpose, only mining Bitcoin. However, the technology behind data center construction and management both for crypto mining and AI are the same. So any large-scale miner potentially can build a data center for AI operations.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The real challenge, however, is to determine the demand for computing power, Bekbauov explained.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With Bitcoin mining, it’s easy, because all mined coins can be sold on exchanges whenever miners have needs. But with AI computing you need to find buyers of computing power to generate revenue, which can be hard.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Xive executive further added that Bitcoin miners can diversify their strategy by building out large facilities for AI data centers since miners already have experience in &#8220;connecting all the dots&#8221; in terms of &#8220;finding electricity capacities, building electrical and cooling infrastructure, supplying GPUs, maintaining data centers, etc.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Opportunity</h2>
<p>Bekbauov highlighted the opportunity for miners to participate in the global need for computational power, which, according to the exec, has emerged as the world&#8217;s most important resource in the information age. The Xive co-founder, however, said the industry requires more transparency in terms of needs from AI companies, who can be perfect customers for data centers.</p>
<p>While the software side of AI is progressing faster on the front, the same can’t be said for the hardware side of things, which cannot catch up with the pace of AI developments.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Users need to wait from 5 minutes to a couple of days to get their responses for prompts, especially with pictures and videos. Number of users is growing exponentially. But we can’t say the same for hardware which is used for supplying computing power to work on all of the demand.”</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has exhibited significant volatility recently, surpassing its previous minor swing high while simultaneously encountering substantial rejection. Nonetheless, the price is approaching a crucial area, with the overall price action signalling a bearish outlook.</p>
<h1>Technical Analysis</h1>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>A thorough analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s daily chart reveals the formation of an evident bearish double-top pattern near the major resistance region of $30K. Additionally, the price is facing significant dynamic resistance from the middle-trendline of the ascending channel. It is worth noting that this robust dynamic level has been hindering further price appreciation for several months.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a noticeable divergence between the price and the RSI indicator indicates a shift in the market condition from an uptrend state to a possible downtrend. In case the selling pressure dominates the market, Bitcoin&#8217;s next target would be the 100-day moving average situated around the $28K level.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it seems likely that a rejection from the substantial resistance at $30K is imminent based on Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price action.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261009" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261009" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-261009 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_1707231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-261009" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>The 4-hour chart demonstrates that Bitcoin&#8217;s price has entered an extended consolidation range following its arrival at the important price zone of $30K. Notably, this critical price range aligns with Bitcoin&#8217;s previous significant swing high, developed on April 14th, which has served as strong resistance due to increased supply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the price has formed an ascending wedge pattern, typically indicating a potential reversal. Most recently, the price experienced a sharp surge, reaching the upper boundary of the wedge, only to face rejection and undergo a rapid decline. However, a break below the lower edge of the wedge suggests the possibility of a mid-term reversal.</p>
<p>Ultimately, in the event of a rejection, Bitcoin&#8217;s next target would be the static support region around $28K.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been volatile, especially after a significant upward surge that brought it close to the crucial resistance level of $30K. This surge has sparked substantial speculation regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to successfully break through this resistance barrier. It is advisable to closely examine the futures market to gain valuable insights into the overall market sentiment.</p>
<p>The provided chart illustrates the Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio, which serves as an essential indicator of the intensity of long and short positions.</p>
<p>Lately, this particular metric has been fluctuating consistently below 1, following a sharp decline. However, there have been no signs of recovery thus far. This signifies that futures traders predominantly maintain a pessimistic outlook on Bitcoin, with their short positions potentially pushing downward pressure on the price in the short term.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the crypto market has exhibited significant volatility, with major coins like XRP and Stellar Lumens first seeing large gains, then experiencing sharp pullbacks.</p>
<p>This volatility has yet to impact the progress of the crypto analytics project yPredict, which is currently in the midst of a highly-successful presale phase.</p>
<p>However, with attention back on the crypto market, projects new and old are benefiting from renewed investor interest – setting the stage for a fruitful few months ahead.</p>
<h2>Ripple Ruling Reenergizes $XRP &#8211; Although Momentum Stalls After Pullback</h2>
<p>XRP ($XRP) has been the talk of the crypto market over the past few days following some huge news regarding the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple – the company behind $XRP.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that Ripple had violated federal securities laws by offering $XRP in an unregistered securities sale.</p>
<p>As such, the SEC argued that $XRP was a security – a statement Ripple vehemently denied.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-18.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261023" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-18.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-18.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-18-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-18-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, on July 13, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-says-sec-lawsuit-vs-ripple-labs-can-proceed-trial-some-claims-2023-07-13/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Ripple did not violate federal securities law, according to a ruling by US District Judge Analisa Torres.</p>
<p>This landmark legal victory sent the value of $XRP surging over 100%, although the token’s price has pulled back by 22% since the peak of the bullish surge.</p>
<p>While the SEC did win a partial victory concerning $XRP sales to institutional investors, the ruling was seen as a major boost for the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>Thus, with $XRP now trading around the $0.73 level, investors will be keeping a close eye on whether the token can reignite its upside momentum.</p>
<h2>Stellar Soars Then Settles as $XLM Bulls Stay Optimistic</h2>
<p>Stellar ($XLM) also saw its price surge after the favorable Ripple ruling – but this momentum has also cooled off recently.</p>
<p>On the day of the Ripple news, the price of $XLM spiked by 104% to $0.196 before giving back a significant portion of these gains over the weekend.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, $XLM is trading for around $0.126 – 35% lower than Thursday’s high.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-261022" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-18-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Although $XLM has a different use case than $XRP, the two projects share common origins, and their prices have moved in tandem in the past.</p>
<p>The initial $XLM price spike was driven by the fact that the positive Ripple ruling boded well for the broader crypto market in terms of resolving regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>However, profit-taking has kicked in, bringing $XLM back from its temporary high.</p>
<p>The good news for $XLM bulls is the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stellar" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a> sentiment analysis reveals more than 80% of users are feeling good about the token’s prospects – highlighting there is still plenty of optimism behind Stellar.</p>
<h2>Which New Crypto Projects Are Benefiting from the Market Momentum?</h2>
<p>The surge in $XRP and $XLM has revitalized confidence throughout the entire crypto sector.</p>
<p>This belief has spilled over to new projects like yPredict – an AI-powered crypto analytics platform in the midst of a highly-successful presale phase.</p>
<h2>Presale Project yPredict Pioneers AI-Powered Crypto Insights &amp; SEO Solutions</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_e65e4a9b.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=xrp-price-stellar-lumens-price-rally-cools-off-but-ypredict-is-rising" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">yPredict ($YPRED)</a> is an emerging crypto project riding the wave of positive market sentiment.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Analysts at IntoTheBlock said a large part of the unmoved assets might be coins lost forever.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain data examined by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has revealed that roughly 29% of all bitcoins (BTC) in circulation have remained unmoved for more than five years.</p>
<p>In a Monday tweet, analysts at the firm <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1680834832601939968" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a> a large part of the unmoved assets might be lost coins.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1680834832601939968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>29% of BTC Lost?</h2>
<p>IntoTheBlock&#8217;s latest analysis echoes a recent report from crypto exchange Bitfinex, which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/new-ath-bitcoins-unmoved-supply-peaks-amid-institutional-interest-bitfinex-report/?amp" data-wpel-link="internal">disclosed</a> that the amount of unmoved BTC has reached a new all-time high, leading to a decrease in the asset&#8217;s liquidity.</p>
<p>Bitfinex also reported that approximately 70% of BTC&#8217;s circulating supply has remained dormant for at least a year; this is the highest ever recorded since the inception of the leading crypto asset.</p>
<p>While there is no specific reason for the current and prolonged dormancy of a significant portion of BTC, several factors are considered to have led to the development.</p>
<p>As IntoTheBlock&#8217;s analysts speculated, most of the coins could be lost forever. On the other hand, it could be a sign of growing interest from investors, especially institutions, who have a bullish sentiment toward Bitcoin and believe in the asset&#8217;s long-term potential.</p>
<p>The HODLing attitude from both large and institutional investors indicates an expectation of positive price action for BTC, showing that they consider the crypto asset a viable investment option.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Upcoming Halving Event</h2>
<p>Another factor to consider is the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-halving-effect-on-assets-behavior-still-unclear-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">upcoming</a> Bitcoin halving event slated for April 2024. Every four years, at 210,000 blocks, a mechanism in the Bitcoin network slashes the block reward for BTC mining by half. Bitcoin&#8217;s fourth halving will reduce block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.</p>
<p>The event is viewed as a bullish sign because it enhances BTC&#8217;s prospective scarcity, supports its supply-demand dynamics, and affects its value positively.</p>
<p>As the halving approaches, crypto funds and investment firms are accumulating BTC at its current price level, increasing their holdings, and positioning themselves for positive price action.</p>
