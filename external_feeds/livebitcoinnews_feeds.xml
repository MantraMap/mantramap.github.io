										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you lost your crypto <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/password/" data-wpel-link="internal">password</a> and can’t gain access to your funds? Crypto Asset Recovery can <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/how-a-father-and-son-are-helping-cryptocurrency-users-recover-their-lost-assets/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">help you with that</a>.</p>
<h2>Crypto Asset Recovery Helps with Lost Passwords</h2>
<p>Crypto Asset Recovery is a father and son team that works to help people that have lost access to their digital asset portfolios. Usually, the money is locked up in a secure crypto wallet or encrypted somewhere. The people in question cannot engage in a lost-their-password process to set up a new access point.</p>
<p>Last year, Chainalysis – a blockchain analysis firm – released a report claiming that as much as 23 percent of the world’s total bitcoin units have been lost to time simply because people can no longer access them due to lost passwords. Today, this would be worth about $62 billion.</p>
<p>Crypto Asset Recovery is made up of Chris Brooks, the father, and Charles Brooks, his son. They work to help people gain access to the crypto they’ve lost. If they’re successful, they garner 20 percent of the once-lost stashes, while returning the rest to the owners. They’re usually paid in bitcoin and sometimes, they warn, the recovery process can take a year or longer.</p>
<p>Prior to getting involved in the crypto space, Chris was a former vice president of technology at a company called Care Scout. He said that while he read the initial bitcoin whitepaper in 2014, it took him a while to get excited about the new currency and the technology behind it. He stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>I looked at some mining opportunities and some trading opportunities, and they just didn’t work for various reasons, and then I started coming across forum posts of people saying, ‘Hey, I’ve lost the password to my wallet,’ and I thought, ‘I’m a programmer. I know how to solve that problem,’ and so I started this in 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right after that year, the price of bitcoin wound up crashing and burning, so he stepped away from his business and decided to put more time and energy into a separate entity. However, given the high rate of password recovery demand he was witnessing in 2020 and 2021, he made a triumphant return.</p>
<h2>A Return of Sorts</h2>
<p>Charles threw his two cents into the mix, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>For me, it’s like digital treasure hunting, and it really has this life-changing bounty at the end of a rainbow sometimes. We decided to spin up Crypto Asset Recovery again, and we spun it up kind of on the presumption of running this for a month or two to see if we have market fit… It was clear there was market fit and a need for this kind of service in the space.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a positive sign to know that so many people are still interested in maintaining their crypto portfolios despite dramatic losses of the past 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite all that’s happened over the past 12 months, millennials <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/personalfinance/should-millennials-rely-on-crypto-for-retirement/ar-AA115E6P" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">see value in crypto</a>. In fact, they’re betting big on digital assets and relying on them to comprise their retirement portfolios.</p>
<h2>Millennials Are Still Big Crypto Fans</h2>
<p>This is good in that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/millennials/" data-wpel-link="internal">millennials</a> clearly understand the value of the crypto space. They see the arena as something big that could potentially bring them many rewards in the future, but several financial analysts are telling said millennials not to go crazy. They say crypto is still a largely unregulated industry, and that betting too big on it could result in heavy losses and similar problems.</p>
<p>Clark Hodges – co-owner of Hodges Capital Management – said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, no, no. As I sit here and contemplate millennials considering cryptocurrencies as the base for their retirement plans, it really does concern me for their futures.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not so much that he’s against crypto; he’s against placing too much money on any high-risk asset. He continued his discussion with:</p>
<blockquote><p>A risky asset should be a small part of a retirement strategy, not the full strategy. Cryptocurrencies are assets that are still very new and unregulated, which increases their risk. What will the landscape look like after the government gets in and has its effect on the cryptocurrency market? I would not want to own cryptocurrency in a major way when that is unfolding right before our very eyes. Traditional stocks and bonds and real estate assets as a long-term retirement strategy are still the most proven way to grow wealth over time. Do what has worked for decades. Buy good quality American companies with good quality earnings that go up in value because the companies make more money year in and year out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matthew Robbs – founder of Smart Saving Advice – says it’s quite easy to invest in crypto when it’s doing well, and he doesn’t think giving up on it completely is something any smart investor should do. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto is exciting to invest in. If you pick the right coin at the right time, you can get five, ten, or 100 times your investment in a matter of a few months or years… In the last two years, bitcoin went from $10,000 to $55,000 in five months and then went from $55,000 to $33,000 in four months. Bitcoin then went up to $69,000 before plummeting to $17,000 over a seven-month period.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Slow and Steady Wins the Race</h2>
<p>He says throwing a bunch of money into the industry at once might be a mistake. He instead says slow and steady contributions to one’s crypto portfolio over time is the right way to go:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investing all your retirement income into crypto only to have it drop 75 percent over a seven-month period will likely cause you to give up on it right before it starts to make another run-up.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re early into 2023, and with 2022 being such a crazy year for <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> fans, it appears many analysts are warning about what we <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2022/12/30/what-do-bitcoin-investors-need-to-know-in-these-frozen-markets/?sh=509b57b971b0" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">should be aware of</a> in these next 12 months so traders can make appropriate investing decisions and keep themselves safe.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin May Bottom Out Soon</h2>
<p>One of the people to talk about what we should expect is Tim Enneking, the managing director of Digital Capital Management. He says one of the big things that’s happened is crypto is beginning to mirror more traditional assets like stocks. This has ultimately made it vulnerable to economic issues like inflation.</p>
<p>In an interview, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest variable affecting BTC at present is, unfortunately, correlation. Assuming correlation remains high (and there is no reason to assume otherwise), crypto markets are beholden to fiat markets, which means inflation and interest rates. Since interest rate increases (first derivative from freshman calculus) have already begun slowing, and they will almost certainly stop no later than mid-March (after probably a final 50 bps increase on Feb 1 and then a first and last 25-bps increase), I wouldn’t look for a major breakout for BTC until then.</p></blockquote>
<p>He did offer a more positive outlook on bitcoin’s short-term stamina, however, and he does think a gradual (albeit small) rise can be expected in 2023 just like it was seen in 2019 after the disastrous 2018. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The good news is BTC is putting in a solid bottom, which, however, leaves everyone haunted by the seeming floor at $6K from late June to early November 2019, which felt like a strong bottom until it fell out and BTC went to $3+K for four months. Since the fallout from Celsius, Terra/Luna, FTX, Alameda, etc., has slowed markedly, our feeling is that we’re at or very near the bottom (which is $15.5K). As strange as it feels to write this sentence, a couple good days on Wall Street and we should see BTC threaten $20K.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joe DiPasquale – the CEO of crypto hedge fund Bit Bull Capital – also threw his two cents into the mix, mentioning in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the moment, many are predicting a capitulation to under $10K. However, we don’t think the chances of such a possibility are higher than bitcoin bottoming around $13-$15K.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Lot of Bad Stuff in the News, Lately</h2>
<p>Marc Bernegger – co-founder of crypto fund Alt Alpha Digital – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin already experienced similar phases in the past years, which could be summarized as ‘times of ignorance and disinterest.’ We saw several very negative events in the last few weeks and months, and many investors lost confidence in bitcoin as a potential hedge during downturns of traditional markets. Many fundamentals indicate a bottom at the actual price levels and investors like hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers wait on the sideline to (re)allocate part of their alternative assets into bitcoin.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of investors that filed a class-action lawsuit against <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/coinbase-customers-block-attempts-move-133216210.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">popular digital currency exchange</a> Coinbase are now withholding their account information as a means of preventing their case from moving into arbitration territory. They want to see their situation escalate to the American court system and placed before a judge.</p>
<h2>Could Coinbase Find Itself in Court?</h2>
<p>The customers allege that the security measures initiated by Coinbase against hackers and cyberthieves were weak and resulted in the loss of funds. In addition, they say Coinbase has worked hard not to compensate those who have fallen victim to criminal activity.</p>
<p>One plaintiff mentioned in the lawsuit says that he had $6,000 in crypto funds illegally taken from his wallet and moved to an address that wasn’t his. He also alleges that Coinbase did nothing to prevent the hackers from accessing his banking data, and that they stole another $1,000 from his bank account.</p>
<p>After calling the institution and reversing the transaction, he was able to receive his funds back, though Coinbase locked his account and cited a negative balance in his wallet. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. It alleges that Coinbase does not use “standard practices” to keep its customers protected, nor does it reasonably allow customers access to their accounts on a permanent or at least extended basis.</p>
<p>Coinbase, like many digital currency enterprises, has had a very hard time as of late due to the ongoing bearish conditions of the crypto space. The exchange initially announced that 2022 was going to be a year of hiring new personnel and adding to its growing roster of staff members, though this plan <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-freezing-all-2022-hiring-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal">became frozen in place when</a> bitcoin started losing value very quickly last year.</p>
<p>Things then took a turn for the worse when <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-laying-off-several-employees/" data-wpel-link="internal">the exchange said</a> it would be laying off about 18 percent of its staff, claiming it could not keep up with the ongoing volatility and thus could not afford to pay all the required salaries giving how tied it was to BTC, which was falling faster than anyone could have predicted.</p>
<p>Still, however, the company has garnered a certain degree of support from crypto heads such as Cathie Wood of <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-122536067.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">Ark Invest fame</a>. Not long ago, Wood decided to double down on her ownership of Coinbase stock and purchased several more shares given that they had dipped dramatically from where they were when the company first <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-public-debut-of-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">went public on the</a> Nasdaq in April of 2021.</p>
<h2>Wood Still Predicts Big Things for the Firm</h2>
<p>Explaining her decision, Wood wrote in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the extent investors have reserves of cash to put to work, ARK believes that this time will be no different and that innovation strategies will be prime beneficiaries when equity markets recover.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investors in the Gemini exchange in New York are suing <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/winklevoss-twins-and-cryptocurrency-exchange-gemini-lawsuit-fraud-investors-2022-12" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the company and its founders</a> – Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – for fraud.</p>
<h2>Gemini Is Being Sued</h2>
<p>It is alleged in a class-action lawsuit that the company is in violation of the Exchange Act. A complaint was filed against Gemini and its creators in the US Southern District of New York, and it centers around the firm’s Earn Program, which offers as much as 7.4 percent interest to traders who take part in it. The program halted all offerings in the month of December in 2022, meaning all investors that still had money within its confines suddenly couldn’t get ahold of their funds.</p>
<p>The Earn Program was allegedly shut down due to the company’s ties to the now fallen FTX exchange, which <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed bankruptcy</a> in late November following <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">complaints of a liquidity crunch</a> on social media. FTX is believed to have lent more than $10 billion in customer digital funds to Alameda Research, another company founded by FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>The fall of FTX led to negative effects for Genesis Global, an institutional crypto firm and partner of Gemini. Two of the plaintiffs listed in the court filing – Max. J. Hastings and Brendan Picha – allege that Gemini did not register assets in the Earn Program as securities as they were required to do in accordance with present monetary laws in the U.S.</p>
<p>The complaint reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Genesis encountered financial distress [due to] a series of collapses in the crypto market in 2022, including FTX Trading Ltd. (‘FTX’), Genesis was unable to return the crypto assets it borrowed from Gemini Earn investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>To say that Gemini has been having a rough time would be something of an understatement. Like many crypto companies, the enterprise has fallen victim to many of the bearish conditions that are now being witnessed daily within the borders of the digital currency space. So much so, that Gemini was forced to lay <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-exchange-says-major-layoffs-are-coming/" data-wpel-link="internal">off approximately ten percent</a> of its staff back in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>The company took flak when it came to light that the firm was letting go of many of its employees via Zoom calls rather than delivering the news to them in person.</p>
<h2>A Lot of Money Is Owed to the Firm</h2>
<p>In addition, Gemini is also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/winklevoss-twins-run-crypto-exchange-owed-900-million-by-genesis-2022-12?inline-endstory-related-recommendations=" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">allegedly owed close</a> to $1 billion by Genesis. The latter firm had approximately $2.8 billion in assorted loans, one of which stems from Genesis, though the company put out a message on Twitter last November that due to the frozen market and trouble with FTX, all redemptions on loans were being paused as of November 16, 2022.</p>
<p>At press time, it’s unclear when or even <em>if</em> the enterprise plans to begin its loan payment processes again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana – a crypto that’s otherwise known as SOL to its personal holders – continues to shed <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency/embattled-cryptocurrency-solana-continues-to-crash" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">value given it’s so tied</a> to the fallen crypto exchange FTX and its disgraced head executive Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<h2>Solana Isn&#8217;t Doing Too Well</h2>
<p>FTX is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">currently in the process</a> of filing bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of lending out approximately $10 billion in user funds to his other company Alameda Research, which was supposed to be a separate and independent entity from FTX. By conjoining them through loan activity, he broke several agreement terms and is now awaiting trial for fraud and other charges.</p>
<p>He is in <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/23/sam-bankman-fried-arrives-at-parents-home/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">California at his parents&#8217; home</a>. The pair have signed a $250 million bond pledging their home and other personal assets as collateral should SBF choose to flee the country. Two other close friends have also pledged their assets to the bond requirement.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – which is presently engaged in a civil suit against SBF and FTX – has stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire.</p></blockquote>
<p>Solana has deep ties to the fallen exchange and has since crashed by more than 96 percent since reaching an all-time high during the month of November 2021. During that time, it was trading for just shy of $260 per unit. At the time of the FTX bankruptcy, the currency had fallen to less than ten dollars.</p>
<p>Solana’s ties to FTX are so deep that it’s often dubbed “Sam Coin” in <em>honor</em> of Sam Bankman-Fried (not such a big honor anymore). The asset has links to an on-chain crypto exchange known as Serum, which was also created by Bankman-Fried. Solana is issued by the Solana blockchain, which presently engages in decentralized finance (defi) protocols and offers monetary products such as loans and mortgages.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Solana was considered one of the most promising digital assets on the market, though things have certainly taken a nasty turn with the recent collapse of FTX. Still, there are some that claim it has a lot of potential, one of those being Vitalik Buterin. As the co-creator of Ethereum, Buterin recently stated on social media:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future. Hard for me to tell from [the] outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Could His Words Lend a Hand?</h2>
<p>It’s unclear if this will help boost the currency’s prospects with traders.</p>
<p>Given Buterin’s present standing in the industry, it’s likely to do something, though things remain bearish at press time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin had a rough 2022, but that hasn’t stopped <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/bitcoin-is-still-well-below-20-000-so-why-haven-t-kevin-o-leary-edward-snowden-and-other-celebrity-investors-given-up-on-it/ar-AA15LVeK" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">high-ranking celebrities</a> and investors from praising it. They feel that while bitcoin may have had a rough 12 months, things can always return to form, and they’re not turning their backs on the world’s number one digital currency by market cap yet.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Still the Apple of Many Celebrities&#8217; Eyes</h2>
<p>Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021. Just a year later, the currency was trading in the high $16,000 range. That’s a valuation dip of more than 70 percent. It’s a sad and ugly sight to see, yet there are still so many individuals out there that have hope that the currency is not dead yet.</p>
<p>One of those people is NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who now calls Russia home after fleeing the U.S. In a conference last June, he explained to the viewers about BTC:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s like a forest fire. When the ground has been cleared, things will grow again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another person who’s refusing to give up on bitcoin is “Shark Tank” star <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/kevin-oleary/" data-wpel-link="internal">Kevin O’Leary</a>. Always a bitcoin bull, O’Leary explained in an interview last summer that bitcoin has “so much intellectual property” and that it’s a “genius idea.” He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you go to any graduating cohort, go engineering, a third of them would want to work in the chain. They don’t want to work in the 11 sectors of the economy. They want something new.</p></blockquote>
<p>Patrick Thompson – host of the blockchain and digital asset podcast “More Than Money” – says while many celebrities continue to support bitcoin, the asset has no doubt experienced heavy value loss over the past several months. There are many reasons for this in his mind, a big one being that there’s heavy talk of a recession.</p>
<p>With so much economic uncertainty in the air, it’s likely many people are getting rid of risky assets and trying to swoop up as much cash as possible. Thompson believes bitcoin was the asset that likely sparked the ongoing selloffs of many risky assets. Discussing crypto, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s an industry built on an extremely unstable foundation. Many of the biggest companies in the cryptocurrency space had extremely high-risk business models and were over-leveraged… Why would someone want to hold an asset that will most likely decrease in value in the short term? Sometimes, you need to cut off your finger to save your hand, to sell assets now so that your total losses aren’t as detrimental as they could possibly be.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Speculation Isn&#8217;t the Main Problem</h2>
<p>Merav Ozair – a blockchain expert at Rutgers Business School – says speculation isn’t entirely to blame for this crypto winter. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, the crypto market is very much correlated and in tune with everything that is happening in the economy and with other asset classes.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top spy agency of South Korea stated its <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/south-korea-s-top-spy-agency-says-north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-12-billion-in-cryptocurrency-and-other-virtual-assets/ar-AA15CohS" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">neighbor North Korea has</a> stolen an estimated $1.5 trillion won worth of cryptocurrency funds over the past five years. This is equivalent to about $1.2 billion in USD. More than half of that money was stolen in the year 2022 alone.</p>
<h2>North Korea Is Still Stealing Crypto</h2>
<p>North Korea <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/north-korea/" data-wpel-link="internal">has long been in the</a> habit of stealing digital currency and engaging in crypto hacks and related activities to garner the funds it needs to continue building its nuclear arsenal. The country also experienced a weakening economy during the days of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coronavirus/" data-wpel-link="internal">the COVID pandemic</a> and has also suffered at the hands of the U.S., which has regularly imposed sanctions against the nation. Thus, the country has long been in desperate need of fast cash, and it’s often turned to crypto to make this happen.</p>
<p>But this crypto is usually stolen from other regions of the world including the United States, several parts of Europe, and of course, South Korea. The National Intelligence Service – the main spy agency of the latter region – has said that North Korea’s ability to steal digital currencies has grown exponentially over the years, and they predict the methods it uses are among the best in the world.</p>
<p>Sanctions against North Korea were toughened in the year 2017 by the United Nations given its ongoing nuclear missile tests and its regular focus on cybercrime. Exports from North Korea – such as coal, textiles, and seafood – have all been very limited over the past five or six years, causing the nation to pass several of its foreign workers onto other regions. Even further restrictions came about during the days of the pandemic, and by then, North Korea was allegedly suffering like it never had before.</p>
<p>South Korea is now saying that its neighbor to the north is not done stealing digital assets. In fact, it’s likely only getting started. South Korea fully expects its northern counterpart to conduct additional illegal cyber hacks in the year 2023, and that more crypto is likely to make its way into the hands of Kim Jong-un and his fellow regulators.</p>
<h2>Trying to Keep Itself Alive</h2>
<p>In addition, South Korea says that the northern region will also attempt to make off with specific technology information and confidential data regarding South Korean foreign policy and national security.</p>
<p>In December of last year, several representatives of nations like the U.S., South Korea, and Japan all unanimously agreed to increase their efforts to fight off or at least limit the illegal dealings of North Korea. Just last February, a panel of U.N. representatives claimed that the nation of North Korea was continuing to engage in cyberattacks on various crypto firms and exchanges, and that missile tests go on despite the nation’s ailing economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2022 was a bad year for crypto. Bitcoin and many leading forms of digital currency have crashed, but that doesn’t <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/alberta-cryptocurrency-companies-still-say-they-re-optimistic-despite-industry-struggles/ar-AA15MEY8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mean all the crypto companies</a> out there are turning their backs on their respective industries. Several companies in Calgary, Canada – like Bitvo Inc. – still believe crypto has a fighting chance, and they’re refusing to give up on this growing financial arena.</p>
<h2>Calgary Has Tried Hard to Incorporate Crypto</h2>
<p>Bitvo is a unique firm <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">in that FTX</a> – the now failed crypto exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried – was all set to acquire the Calgary-based trading platform in June. Given that FTX has completely crashed and burned, Bitvo has said the entire deal will not go through, now. It has also said it had no direct links to FTX, nor is it part of the company’s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Pamela Draper – president and CEO of Bitvo – said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s no impact on Bitvo&#8217;s operations, or the security of our customers&#8217; funds, as a result of the FTX failure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calgary – which is situated in Alberta, Canada – has long tried to position itself as an industry leader. This is ultimately why the government of the region was so willing to work with FTX at one point. Sam Bankman-Fried and many other employees and staff members of the fallen exchange spent time talking to the regulators of Calgary to see how they could build up the exchange’s presence in the area.</p>
<p>In an interview not too long ago, Bankman-Fried said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve had some fantastic conversations with the government of Alberta, which has been really constructive, and [we’re] trying to take the lead in Canada and around the world for crypto policy and frameworks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fall of FTX has certainly led to some ripple effects, and several companies in Canada have felt the heat. Hut 8 – one of the oldest and largest miners in the country – has been hit by the effects of FTX, though it doesn’t feel that the latest bear market is anything to greatly worry about.</p>
<p>Sue Ellis – head of investor relations at Hut 8 – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is not our first bear market. In the last bull market of 2021, we were one of the only guys who were actually setting ourselves up and setting up our balance sheet so that we could weather any sort of storm.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Some Important Factors Are Being Ignored</h2>
<p>Koleya Karringten – executive director of the Canadian Blockchain Consortium – says that while much of the news surrounding crypto has been negative as of late, there are some hardcore developments that have happened that the media is choosing to ignore. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The industry is] developing technology that&#8217;s capable of being exported internationally and supporting everything from remittance payments to better transparency and a more secure supply chain for everything from pharmaceuticals to our energy industry to agriculture.</p></blockquote>
