			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Pacific Island of Fiji has elected a new Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who took office on December 24, and the good news is &ndash; he is reportedly pro-Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Fiji, a nation made up of over 330 islands and located in the Pacific Ocean, elected a new Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who took office on December 24. The news was shared by Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a, a Tongan noble and a former member of the Tongan parliament. Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a said that he explained to the newly elected PM &ldquo;how Fiji can do Bitcoin legal tender like Tonga&rdquo; and hinted that could be two &ldquo;BTC Legal Tender Bills for the Pacific in 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A new pro-#Bitcoin friendly Prime Minister in the South Pacific.☀️🌊🏝️ Fiji 🇫🇯&lsquo;s newly elected Prime Minister @slrabuka.Let&rsquo;s go 2 for 2 - BTC Legal Tender Bills for the Pacific in 2023 👊🏽💯🇹🇴🇫🇯</p>
&mdash; Lord Fusitu'a (@LordFusitua) December 29, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>Cointelegraph reports that Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a explained to them that &ldquo;The new PM is definitely pro-Bitcoin&rdquo; and quotes Fusitu&rsquo;a as saying:</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>He asked to meet with me which we did via zooms since last year to walk him through step by step, how he could adopt bitcoin legal tender.</p>

<p>Tonga has its own plans to implement Bitcoin as a legal tender and reportedly has legislation in the works which could go live as early as Q2 2023. Tonga started initiating its plans to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender soon after El Salvador&rsquo;s Bitcoin Law came into effect.</p>
Bitcoin Would Benefit Pacific Islands
<p>Both Fiji and Tonga stand to gain a lot from adopting Bitcoin with respect to remittances. Both countries face similar economic and developmental challenges given their location and history. Fiji reports strong growth in terms of financial inclusion recently, but just half of the female population has access to bank accounts making Bitcoin a brilliant tool to improve remittances and aid in banking the unbanked. Bitcoin Magazine reports that remittances sent to Fiji accounted for 11.33% of the country&rsquo;s GDP in 2021, while in Tonga the situation is even more severe &ndash; remittances accounted for a massive 45.5% of Tonga&rsquo;s GDP over the same period.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">December 28, 2022, Tallinn, Estonia: Vulcan Blockchain has just announced that its&rsquo; novel auto-rebasing Layer 1 protocol will launch in Q1 of 2023. The protocol, which has been under development for some time aims to balance supply side issues affecting market stability. In this vein, the primary key feature of the Vulcan Blockchain is its Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s5">Vulcan, named after the god of fire and forge, features unique never before seen blockchain technology. Auto-Rebasing is a unique feature that allows a blockchain to automatically adjust its supply of circulating coins. This can be an important tool for maintaining the stability and value of the native coin over time, as well as providing a more predictable and transparent monetary policy.</p>
<p class="s5">The Vulcan Blockchain is also Auto-Compounding, which means that as a holder of $VUL, your ownership of coins increases with each epoch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s11">&ldquo;In addition to providing stability, an Auto-Rebasing blockchain can also help to provide greater transparency and predictability,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s11">said Jason Matthison, COO of Vulcan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s11">&ldquo;By clearly outlining the rules and conditions under which the supply of tokens will be adjusted, an auto-rebasing blockchain can give users and investors a better understanding of the monetary policy of the network. This can help to increase confidence in the network, making it more attractive to users and investors,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s5">To add to its Auto-Rebasing, Auto-Compounding capabilities, the Vulcan Blockchain also has a unique burn mechanism, known as the "Fire Pit&rdquo; (a null address). 80% of all transaction fees on the network are automatically sent to the Fire Pit, which is totally inaccessible and burns the coins from the circulating supply forever. This feature allows $VUL to become hyper deflationary and a trusted store of value cryptocurrency over time.</p>
<p class="s5">The combination of these features, along with the commitment to decentralization, makes the Vulcan Blockchain the ideal platform for DeFi applications. Whether you are a user, developer, or investor, the invitation exists to join the Vulcan Network on this exciting journey and be a part of the future of DeFi.</p>
<p class="s13">About Vulcan Blockchain</p>
<p class="s5">Vulcan Blockchain is the first blockchain with a built-in Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes. The Vulcan Blockchain is also Auto-Compounding, which means that as a holder of $VUL, your ownership of coins increases with each epoch.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ryan Selkis, the co-founder and CEO of Messari, recently published his 2023 Crypto Theses report where he looks at key trends and his predictions for the coming year.</p>
<p>Selkis writes his reports on an annual basis, and this is the sixth consecutive Messari Theses Report. He starts with stating that while cryptocurrency portfolios are down 80% since the last report, the question is:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the dark before the dawn, or the beginning of a long Arctic winter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He outlines that both Bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be &ldquo;on long-term stable ground&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;DeFi will take major strides forward next year.&rdquo; He believes that privacy tech will either be integrated into public blockchains, or that it will be banned on &ldquo;dystopian and vague &ldquo;national security&rdquo; grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also gives his view of the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Infrastructure investments around code security, decentralised hardware, virtual worlds, custody, protocol governance, and blockchain scalability are all in vogue. There will be less NFT speculation. Fewer moon fumes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He says that there is a certain amount of &ldquo;rage&rdquo; that fuels the report, given all the bad actors in crypto that have hogged the stage and set back the years of progress of the good actors.</p>
<p>He includes a short tweet thread in the report, which sums up how he feels about crypto today:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The report is split into 2 parts: the first part is titled &ldquo;What H-A-P-P-E-N-E-D in 2022&rdquo;. Very likely a humorous reference to a certain tweet by Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>The second part of the report is titled &ldquo;Why crypto matters in 2023&rdquo;. He begins this with a tribute to Hal Finney for being a visionary who had inspired and motivated him.</p>
<p>Selkis writes with integrity and honesty when he says of Bitcoin that it has &ldquo;big carbon footprints&rdquo;, but then writes of it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;as a single purpose, commodity money, and secure settlement system, it has held up miraculously. It has proven durability and will continue to serve as a powerful check on absolute sovereign authority&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest of the report is more on Bitcoin, Privacy Coins, Stablecoins, and finally a chapter on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their dystopian character.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p>
<p>On December 16-17 2022, the International Blockchain Summit was held at TechFest at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). Encryptus CEO Shantnoo Saxsena used the platform to encourage crypto users to educate themselves before investing in digital assets.</p>
<p>The summit in Mumbai, India, brought together over 10,000 industry leaders, experts, and enthusiasts to exchange ideas about the crypto and blockchain ecosystem. Speakers included Shiv Kumar Bhasin, COO and CTO of the National Stock Exchange; Shantnoo Saxsena, Founder and CEO of Encryptus; and Mru Patel from My Tokenized Capital. These experts shared their thoughts on crypto, the metaverse, and NFTs.</p>
<p>During the summit, Encryptus and other attendees discussed pain points in the industry and collaboratively explored solutions to improve the digital asset space and promote crypto adoption.</p>
<p>The International Blockchain Summit also focused on emerging trends in different industries such as Defence, Technology, and Machine Learning. Mr. Shiv Kumar spoke about the implementation of a CBDC in India. He highlighted the challenges, government plans, and the future of the E-Rupee. Mr. Patel discussed NFTs and the metaverse and how they can play an active role in driving web3 adoption.</p>
<p>Shantnoo Saxsena had a house full of students as he spoke about the basics of cryptocurrency: its adoption, scams, and how to stay safe at all times. He commented: &ldquo;Users must educate themselves before investing their hard-earned money. There are over 20,000 projects out there and not all the projects are legit. Buying cryptos is not tricky, but buying the right cryptos, clean cryptos, with proper storage is more critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TechFest was attended by the likes of Mahindra, Netradyne, Kebbi, and BrahMos. There were also representatives from LBank, Google, TATA Consultancy Services, Jio Mobile, and Boeing at the two-day event.</p>
<p>About Encryptus</p>
<p>Encryptus started out as a crypto advisory company in London back in 2020, and since then got approvals from a couple of countries for buying and selling crypto assets. Encryptus is operated by an experienced team of experts who thoroughly understand the risks, compliances, and opportunities in the crypto space.

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) attempted to add to its recent bounce early in the Asian session as the pair retraced some of its recent losses after trading as low as the 16460 area, its weakest print since trading as low as 16273.40 earlier this month.&nbsp; The pair was recently unable to move back above the 17000 figure, peaking around the 16777.35 area in a test of the 50-bar, 4-hour simple moving average.&nbsp; The pair has generally been orbiting the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16770.19 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16632.91.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto investment firm Midas is shutting down its DeFi platform after suffering irrevocable losses in the Terra, Celsius, and FTX crashes.&nbsp;</p>
$63M Deficit Forces Midas Shutdown
<p>In the aftermath of the heavy losses incurred in the series of crashes in the industry this year, Midas Investments is closing down its DeFi-based yields platform. The news broke when Midas CEO and founder Iakov &ldquo;Trevor&rdquo; Levin wrote and published a blog announcing the news on Tuesday, claiming a deficit of $63 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Levin wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Trevor, the CEO of Midas Investments, and I am writing to you today with a heavy heart to announce that the Midas platform is closing down. Based on this situation and current CeFi market conditions, we have reached the difficult decision to close the platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blog also detailed the heavy losses suffered by the platform in 2022, as Levin claimed that the Midas platform suffered a cumulative loss of $50 million. According to the founder, the platform needs to be shut down since the respective crashes of the Celsius and FTX ecosystems wiped out over 60% of all assets under the management of the Midas portfolio and created a significant asset deficit.&nbsp;</p>
CeDeFi Shows Way Forward
<p>Furthermore, Levin also outlined the way forward for Midas, claiming that the company will be focusing on its CeDeFi or centralized decentralized finance initiatives in order to create fully transparent, on-chain investment options</p>
<p>He wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the past eight months, our team has been focused on identifying and capitalizing on opportunities to balance our assets and liabilities. This included launching CeDeFi strategies, seeking fundraising, and exploring opportunities with DeFi protocols. Despite these efforts, the extensive withdrawals due to the insolvency of Celcius and FTX, coupled with reduced yield opportunities on the market, made it impossible for us to cover daily payouts to users due to the assets deficit.&rdquo;</p>

Balance Adjustments With MIDAS Tokens
<p>The company has already started its process of shutting down the DeFi platform. On Tuesday, all deposits, swaps, and withdrawals were disabled. The team is working on calculating and adjusting account balances by deducting 55% from user balances held in BTC, ETH, and stablecoins. The remaining amount will be compensated with MIDAS tokens that users will be able to exchange for the new tokens of the upcoming project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Levin wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goal of the new project is to create a win-win situation by connecting competing protocols with liquidity and offering a simplified yield to a range of DeFi and CeFi audiences.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After claiming for days that platform users had just fallen for phishing scams, 3Commas CEO finally admitted that compromised API keys were behind the loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
User API Keys Compromised
<p>3Commas admitted that the platform was compromised on Wednesday after an anonymous Twitter user published around 100,000 API keys belonging to users. However, there has been word around the blockchain that the platform&rsquo;s API database has been compromised for a while now. Just last week, there was news of crypto funds worth $22 million being siphoned away through these compromised API keys. Back then, the platform&rsquo;s CEO claimed that the loss in funds happened due to the poor decisions taken by some users who fell for phishing scams. However, dozens of users had claimed that their API keys were used to execute trades on exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase without their consent.&nbsp;</p>
Not An Inside Job
<p>With the confirmation of the API database compromise, however, CEO Yuriy Sorokin has been forced to eat his words and admit the real problem with the platform. On Wednesday, he tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw the hacker&rsquo;s message and can confirm that the data in the files is true. As an immediate action, we have asked that Binance, Kucoin, and other supported exchanges revoke all the keys that were connected to 3Commas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorokin also revealed that the team has been investigating the possibility of an inside job, owing to the nature of the hack; however, no such evidence was discovered. The inside job was suspected since a very small number of technical employees had access to the infrastructure. Sorokin claimed that their access had been removed since November 19.&nbsp;</p>
3Commas Failed To Prevent API Compromise
<p>The 3Commas platform allows users to link more than one account held in different crypto exchanges to automated trading software via application programming interfaces or APIs. However, if unwanted parties get hold of these API keys, then they can control all of the linked accounts and drain funds, which is exactly what happened in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorokin spoke about focusing on implementing tighter security measures to prevent a repeat of this incident. He tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since then, we have implemented new security measures and will not stop there; we are launching a full investigation involving law enforcement. We are sorry that this has gotten so far and will continue to be transparent in our communications around the situation.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Skylex Layer-1 blockchain is preparing to launch its mainnet in Q3 of 2023. Once the mainnet is launched, Skylex will be able to reduce the block's finality to 3 seconds. To do that, Skylex Network has developed multiple products and services that allow users to join the world&rsquo;s fastest-developing digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>Skylex&rsquo; Goal for 2023 Mainnet Launch</p>
<p>The Layer-1 blockchain Skylex is preparing to launch its mainnet in Q3 of 2023, reducing the block's finality to 3 seconds. And in that process, Skylex Network has developed multiple products and services that allow users to join their digital ecosystem.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The project combines Layer-1 technology with products such as mobile crypto client-side wallets, decentralized and centralized exchanges, and the SLX nodes. This way, Skylex is developing a network of cooperating products and services to maximize users' and companies' bond with the crypto world, as well as strengthen the Skylex brand on the market. Such combinations ensure the incredibly high stability of the entire Skylex ecosystem.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology has allowed the world to unlock extensions of talent that previous generations could not even dream of. However, a couple of technology giants control electronic devices, vehicles, banking systems, and social media platforms that are now part of our daily lives. Monopolizing an unethical industry, companies interfere with users&rsquo; privacy. However, blockchain promises the most in protecting user privacy. The distributed nature and various forms of encryption on the blockchain allow users to interact securely through a fair and private system. Although the potential of blockchain is clear, the technology is in its infancy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;SKYLEX Network was created to return to society financial freedom, transparency of transactions, as well as the possibility of free choice. We&rsquo;ve created a platform and an ecosystem from scratch, the main pillar of which is users&rsquo; freedom.&rdquo; - says Skylex VP David Ternus. &nbsp;</p>

<p>SLX Nodes</p>
<p>&nbsp;Each SLX Node contains a specific number of SLX tokens and allows anyone to participate in confirming transactions on the SLX network, which ultimately translates into participation in the rewards from confirmed transactions. By acquiring SLX Nodes, each user joins the activity Skylex Network, which maximizes and stabilizes the performance and development of the Skylex Network ecosystem and gets rewarded for it. All transactions carried out on exchanges by Skylex Network are available in SLX Explorer. The total number of SLX Tokens in the nodes with limited available quantity equals 20,000,000,000 SLX tokens (i.e., 194,000 SLX Nodes). &nbsp;</p>
<p>With such a limited number of Nodes, the principle of "First come, first served" is holy, so joining the Skylex Network at an early stage will let everyone get their own validator. It is also worth noting that in the first week after the launch of Skylex Network, the platform registered over 2,500 users, which is constantly growing. Furthermore, users should acknowledge that the mainnet launch strictly depends on the total SLX in Nodes sales. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Aiming on Constant Improvement</p>
<p>SKYLEX was built with many features to differentiate it from its competitors, but its greatest strength lies in the team behind it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will consistently demonstrate our ability to innovate, execute and grow rapidly. These qualities serve us well in helping us stay one step ahead of the competition. There is enormous untapped potential in the cryptocurrency market, and we are excited to achieve our success with SKYLEX. We&rsquo;d be ecstatic for our investors and supporters - who are our Skylex Stars - to join us on this journey.&rsquo; - says David Ternus. &nbsp;</p>

<p>About Skylex Network</p>
<p>SKYLEX Network was created to return to society financial freedom, transparency of transactions, and the possibility of free choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company focuses on providing innovative technology, along with services and products that are fully functional and complete, such as decentralized and centralized crypto exchanges and a fully developed layer-1 blockchain.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market is still reeling from the fallout from FTX and needs something to give it the boost it so desperately needs. Japan is one nation that has undertaken the task to liberalize the industry. The country&rsquo;s latest effort is to make it easier for cryptocurrency exchanges to list tokens without having to go through a rigorous pre-screening process. </p>
<p>Japan has taken an active effort to liberalize the crypto industry after the epic failure of Sam Bankman-Fried and his digital empire. According to reports by Bloomberg News, Japan will make it easier for crypto exchanges to list tokens. The body that governs cryptocurrency exchanges informed its member companies of a new rule, which takes effect immediately, allowing them to list coins without having to go through the lengthy pre-screening process unless a token is new to the Japanese market.</p>
Japan Relaxes Onerous Crypto Rules
<p>Under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida&rsquo;s administration, Japan is relaxing some of its burdensome crypto rules even as the contagion from the fall of FTX continues to spread throughout the digital industry.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) recently approved a proposal that would exempt companies issuing cryptocurrencies from taxes on unrealized capital gains for tokens they retain on their books. Japan&rsquo;s current policy dictates that Japanese token issuers are required to pay a set 30% corporate tax on their holdings, regardless of whether they have realized a profit through the sale or not. This current harsh tax policy has forced many domestically established crypto and blockchain firms to set up operations elsewhere. The proposed amendments sims to improve business conditions for companies issuing cryptocurrencies in Japan.</p>
<p>In further a further attempt to help the industry, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) announced that it is reconsidering major cryptocurrency restrictions related to the distribution of foreign issues stablecoins in 2023. Reports indicate that new stablecoin regulations in Japan will allow local exchanges to handle stablecoin trading. As it stands, no local exchanges in Japan are permitted to provide trading in stablecoins such as USDT and USDC.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s Prime Minister has been a vocal advocate of digital assets and blockchain adoption. He recently announced additional investment in the NFT and metaverse industry and said that NFTs, blockchain, and the metaverse will play a vital role in Japan&rsquo;s digital transformation. He used the digitization of national identity cards as an example of this transformation.</p>
Kraken Suspends Operations in Japan
<p>Despite Japan&rsquo;s recent efforts to make it a space for cryptocurrencies to thrive, crypto exchange Kraken, announced on December 28, that it had decided to close its operations in the country and deregister from the FSA effective January 31, 2023. The exchange explained that current market conditions in Japan, combined with a weak global market, forced it to reconsider its investment in Japan, and as a result, would suspend its operations in the country.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a Twitter Spaces chat on Wednesday, Michael Saylor outlined how Microstrategy can contribute to the Bitcoin and Lightning ecosystem.</p>
<p>In 2023, MicroStrategy will unveil software solutions and applications that utilise the Bitcoin Lightning Network. In a recent Twitter Spaces event, the company's executive chairman, Michael Saylor, discussed their plans to not only hold and purchase BTC, but also to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem through their software offerings.</p>
<p>As MicroStrategy expands into the world of Bitcoin, it will use its existing expertise to provide businesses with tools for the Bitcoin and Lightning network.</p>
How does the Lightning Network work?
<p>The Lightning Network is a way to make payments using Bitcoin without having to record each transaction on the blockchain. When two users want to open a payment channel, they put a certain amount of Bitcoin into a smart contract on the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can then make as many transactions as they want within the channel. When they want to close the channel, they can either finalise the balance and record it on the blockchain, or they can agree on a new balance and keep the channel open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lightning Network is helpful for small, frequent transactions because it allows users to avoid high fees and long confirmation times. It also helps to increase the capacity and scalability of the Bitcoin network.</p>
Plans for the Lightning Network
<p>MicroStrategy is looking at using the Lightning Network for a variety of purposes, including monetizing online content, enterprise marketing, setting up paywalls on websites, and internal corporate controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Saylor believes that chief marketing officers should be able to offer small amounts of Bitcoin, known as satoshis, as incentives for customers to leave reviews or provide feedback. He said:</p>
<p>"We want to make it possible for any enterprise to spin up Lighting infrastructure in an afternoon and onboard thousands of employees or customers. We want to plug it into enterprise technology and make it a marketing strategy for any forward thinking CMO."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The FTX/Alameda plot thickens as wallets belonging to Alameda suddenly become active. $1.7 million is put through mixers and swapped for stablecoins and BTC.</p>
<p>On December 28th, 30 cryptocurrency wallets associated with Alameda Research, the bankrupt sister company of the FTX crypto exchange, became active after being inactive for four weeks. These wallets were used to mix and swap over $1.7 million worth of cryptocurrency assets through various crypto-mixing services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto mixers are often used to obscure the transaction path, making it difficult to trace the funds back to the original source. The sudden movement of funds from the Alameda wallets just after Sam Bankman Fried was released on bail has raised suspicions in the cryptocurrency community, and it appears that the individual behind the fund transfers took extensive measures to hide the transaction routes.</p>
<p>In an article published earlier today by CoinTelegraph, data from crypto forensic group Arkham was used to track the wallet movements. The first transfer of funds from the Alameda addresses began with the swapping of tokens for Ether, which was then sent to crypto mixers. Most of these transfers were traced to two main wallets with the addresses starting with 0xe5D and 0x971.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tokens from the Alameda wallet were first sent to an address starting with 0x738 and then on to an address 0x64e. This 0x64e wallet then divided the ETH and sent it to smaller wallets in amounts generally around $200,000 and $50,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, the ETH was sent to mixers such as Fixedfloat and ChangeNOW. Another wallet was used to swap for stablecoins, with the assets from the wallet first being swapped into USDT and then sent to Fixedfloat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A total of 800,000 USDT was swapped out using mixers, while another 400,000 USDT was funnelled through other methods. An additional 200,000 USDT worth of stablecoins were sent to the BTC network using renBTC.</p>
<p>The transfer of funds from the Alameda wallet through mixing tools has generated a lot of discussion in the cryptocurrency community. Some have questioned the legality of the fund transfers, while others have pointed to the use of mixing services and the inability of authorities to prevent such activity.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A crypto trader who exploited code on the Mango Markets DeFi platform maintains that he only did what the code allowed him to do, and that &ldquo;code is law&rdquo;.</p>
Arrested and accused
<p>Cryptocurrency trader Avraham Eisenberg has been arrested in Puerto Rico and charged with fraud by the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan in connection with his alleged exploitation of decentralised finance platform Mango Markets in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trader is accused of using two accounts he controlled to manipulate the price of Mango perpetual swaps, which are futures that allow traders to keep their positions open, and then using the swaps to borrow and withdraw approximately $100 million worth of various tokens from the deposits of other investors on Mango Markets.&nbsp;</p>
A legal trading strategy?
<p>Despite the largely unregulated nature of DeFi, Eisenberg is facing legal consequences for his alleged fraudulent activities, which he had previously boasted about on social media as a "highly profitable" and legal trading strategy.</p>
<p>Eisenberg had been openly discussing his activities on Twitter with over 40,000 followers, claiming that he was pushing the DeFi industry to improve its risk controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, many of the strategies Eisenberg used, such as generating trades to artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency and then borrowing against the artificially higher-valued asset, are considered manipulation in traditional markets and are illegal.&nbsp;</p>
Code is law?
<p>Despite this, the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) that runs Mango Markets agreed to allow Eisenberg to keep almost half of the over $100 million in assets he obtained in exchange for releasing the rest of the funds. Eisenberg remained convinced that he had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Eisenberg's claims of innocence may be rooted in the "code is law" philosophy of DeFi, which holds that the ultimate authority in cryptocurrency is the underlying computer code of most projects. According to this belief, if the code permits a trade to be executed, it is considered legally binding within the world of cryptocurrency. This theory is often cited by proponents of DeFi as a justification for their actions.</p>

<p>The trader is accused of using two accounts he controlled to manipulate the price of Mango perpetual swaps, which are futures that allow traders to keep their positions open, and then using the swaps to borrow and withdraw approximately $100 million worth of various tokens from the deposits of other investors on Mango Markets.&nbsp;</p>
A legal trading strategy?
<p>Despite the largely unregulated nature of DeFi, Eisenberg is facing legal consequences for his alleged fraudulent activities, which he had previously boasted about on social media as a "highly profitable" and legal trading strategy.</p>
<p>Eisenberg had been openly discussing his activities on Twitter with over 40,000 followers, claiming that he was pushing the DeFi industry to improve its risk controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, many of the strategies Eisenberg used, such as generating trades to artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency and then borrowing against the artificially higher-valued asset, are considered manipulation in traditional markets and are illegal.&nbsp;</p>
Code is law?
<p>Despite this, the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) that runs Mango Markets agreed to allow Eisenberg to keep almost half of the over $100 million in assets he obtained in exchange for releasing the rest of the funds. Eisenberg remained convinced that he had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Eisenberg's claims of innocence may be rooted in the "code is law" philosophy of DeFi, which holds that the ultimate authority in cryptocurrency is the underlying computer code of most projects. According to this belief, if the code permits a trade to be executed, it is considered legally binding within the world of cryptocurrency. This theory is often cited by proponents of DeFi as a justification for their actions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Has Bankman-Fried reached a deal with the US authorities? Yes, if a report from Reuters is to be believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following his extradition from the Bahamas, the FTX founder was granted bail, moving in with his parents in Palo Alto, California.&nbsp;</p>
SBF Expected To Enter Plea&nbsp;
<p>According to reports, Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to enter a plea over his involvement in the FTX collapse which led to millions being defrauded from investors, and billions in customer funds being lost. The collapse of FTX, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the space, sent shockwaves through the industry and is touted as the worst collapse in recent financial history.&nbsp;</p>
The Case Against Bankman-Fried&nbsp;
<p>According to court records, Bankman-Fried is expected to be arraigned on the 3rd of January 2023 before US District Judge Lewis Kaplan at the Manhattan Federal Court. Kaplan was assigned to the case after the original judge had to recuse herself due to a conflict of interest. This was because her husband&rsquo;s law firm had advised FTX before it collapsed. Bankman-Fried faces a long list of charges brought in by prosecutors, who accused him of engaging in a years-long &ldquo;fraud of epic proportions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried is accused of using customer deposits, which he redirected to the crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, to purchase real estate and make political donations. He is charged with two counts of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy, including laundering money and committing campaign finance violations. If Bankman-Fried is convicted, he could spend decades behind bars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried has been a significant political donor, with reports claiming that the FTX founder donated millions to both major political parties in the United States, the Democrats, and the Republicans. It is speculated that these donations were made most likely to protect himself in case the operations did not go to plan. According to the data available, the Democrats had received over $40 million from FTX and representatives of the exchange, while Republicans received over $23 million from the exchange.&nbsp;</p>
Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang To Cooperate With Authorities&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, two associates of Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, co-founder of FTX, had pleaded guilty to defrauding investors. Prosecutors revealed that both had agreed to cooperate with the authorities, which puts significant pressure on the former billionaire. Damian Williams, Manhattan US Attorney, urged others associated with the fraud to come forward, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda, now is the time to get ahead of it,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;We are moving quickly, and our patience is not eternal. I also said that last week&rsquo;s announcement would not be our last, and let me be clear once again, neither is today&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While no comment was made from the attorneys of Caroline Ellison, a lawyer for Gary Wang stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gary has accepted responsibility for his actions and takes seriously his obligations as a cooperating witness.&rdquo;</p>

Could Bankman-Fried Get A Similar Deal?&nbsp;
<p>It is speculated that SBF could get similar deals to Ellison and Wang, with both having already paid hefty fines. However, the authorities have yet to provide further details on their course of action regarding Bankman-Fried. Speaking about the case and the options before Bankman-Fried, Jay Clayton, former US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of these things will be the subject of negotiation if there is a plea arrangement. Like you said before, there is a ton of considerations that are going to go into this (political, legal, financial, etc.). I think there will be tremendous pressure to reach a resolution.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Toronto, Canada, 28th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><ul>
  <li>Dr. Ming Wu, co-founder of Conflux Network, was invited to Hong Kong to speak with various government and private organizations about the digital economy, innovation and technology, and has reached an initial strategic cooperation intention.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Conflux is already in the process of registering related entities for the entry into Hong Kong, solidifying its role as foundational infrastructure for Web3.</li>
  <li>This follows October&rsquo;s announcement of the &nbsp;&ldquo;Policy Declaration on the Development of Hong Kong Virtual Assets&rdquo; which has paved the way for a more hospitable blockchain environment in Hong Kong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Ming Wu, Co-Founder of Conflux Network, &nbsp;was invited by the Hong Kong Government to discuss the rise of tech innovation through Web3 and how the Conflux Network could play a foundational role in these developments. During the visit, Dr. Ming Wu had an in-depth discussion with the heads and reception staff of various institutions under the new "Policy Declaration on the Development of Hong Kong Virtual Assets" officially released in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past several years, stringent COVID-19 travel control measures and regulatory uncertainty saw many Hong Kong blockchain and crypto companies shift their businesses to more hospitable areas. &nbsp;This policy shows a significant refocus on digital assets and coincides with the launch of the first two exchange-traded funds for cryptocurrency in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Dr. Ming Wu introduced the Conflux Tree-Graph public chain, explaining it is the only compliant, public and permissionless chain in China and has achieved 3000+ TPS, 5000+ nodes and 0.5s block generation. In terms of throughput, confirmation time, and cost of use, it has 2-3 orders of magnitude advantages over the international first-generation public chain "Bitcoin" and the second-generation public chain "Ethereum". The system performance ranks first in the world.</p>
<p>Dr. Mig Wu said 'Hong Kong's open environment for crypto provides more opportunities for practitioners in Web3 and Metaverse, especially for those from China. People here have more freedom to make the technique and business innovations in a compliant manner. This will also accelerate the integration of Web3 into the traditional internet business and economies to maximally extract its value. By expanding to Hong Kong, Conflux will be able to take a whole different strategy and have the potential to become the foundation to fulfill the Web3 vision of Hong Kong.'</p>
<p>The expansion follows Conflux Network being named a potential unicorn, a private startup company valued at over $1 billion, in the Emerging Giants in Asia Pacific joint report from HSBC and KPMG. &nbsp;One of only five blockchain-related companies to make the prestigious list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Conflux</p>
<p>Conflux is a permissionless Layer 1 blockchain connecting decentralized economies across borders and protocols. Recently migrated to hybrid PoW/PoS consensus, Conflux provides a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain environment with zero congestion, low fees, and improved network security.</p>
<p>As the only regulatory-compliant public blockchain in China, Conflux provides a unique advantage for projects building and expanding into Asia. In the region, Conflux has collaborated with global brands and government entities on blockchain and metaverse initiatives, including the city of Shanghai, McDonald's China, and Oreo.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The fiasco surrounding the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried continues. The latest news to break indicates that SBF and ex-FTX CTO Gary Wang used $546 million from Alameda Research to buy stock in Robinhood. The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a criminal probe into the hack following FTX&rsquo;s bankruptcy declaration and a group of former FTX customers has filed a class-action lawsuit to get their funds back. </p>
SBF and Gary Wang Use Alameda Funds to Purchase Robinhood Shares
<p>An affidavit filed by former FTX CEO, SBF, on the day of his arrest has revealed that he along with FTX co-founder Zixiao &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; Wang took out loans from Alameda Research through four promissory notes between April and May this year to fund the purchase of Robinhood Shares. According to the documents, on April 30, loans to the value of $316.6 million and $35.1 million were awarded to SBF and Wang respectively. Additionally, on May 15, two loans to the value of $175 million and $19.4 million were awarded to SBF. Per the details of the affidavit, the loans were used to fund SBF&rsquo;s Antiguan-based shell company, Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., which purchased a 7.6% stake in Robinhood in May at a price of $648 million at the time.</p>
Justice Department Launches Criminal Probe in $400M FTX Hack
<p>Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the United States Justice Department has launched an investigation into the alleged hack that drained close to $400 million out of FTX-controlled wallets on the night the exchange filed for bankruptcy. Bloomberg cites persons familiar with the matter. Suspicious activity was recorded in the form of massive outflows out of FTX and FTX US&rsquo;s wallets and a hack was later confirmed by FTX CEO John Jay Ray. According to Bloomberg&rsquo;s report, blockchain experts have identified several clues that indicate the hacker was an FTX insider.</p>
FTX Customers File Class-Action Lawsuit
<p>As government agencies continue to probe into FTX and its former executives, a group of former FTX customers has taken matters into their own hands to get their money back first. The lawsuit, filed on December 27, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, involves four plaintiffs who claim the be representing a class of former FTX customers, which might be up to 1 million customers. The class action seeks to obtain priority rights to return digital assets held by FTX and FTX.US to its customers. The plaintiffs claim that per the FTX User Agreement, the platform was not permitted to use customer funds for its own purposes &ndash; which make up the majority of the allegations against FTX and SBF.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The founders of cryptocurrency exchange, Gemini, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, are reportedly facing a new lawsuit from investors over the interest-earning program Gemini Earn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed on December 27th in Manhattan federal court, alleges that the Winklevoss brothers refused to honour any further investor redemptions after halting them due to exposure to troubled trading firm Genesis Global Capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plaintiffs claim that the products have not been registered, preventing them from making a proper risk assessment for using Gemini Earn.</p>
<p>Gemini Earn was launched last year and was designed to generate as much as 8% in interest on crypto holdings. However, the platform faced major issues in mid-November, shortly after reports emerged of liquidity issues at FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, withdrawals on Gemini Earn were halted and the platform remains unavailable for users, with millions of dollars reportedly stuck on Genesis. According to some reports, crypto lender Genesis and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) owe up to $900 million to Gemini clients.</p>
<p>On December 20th, Cameron Winklevoss took to Twitter to announce that Gemini had come up with a plan on behalf of the creditor committee to resolve the liquidity issues at Genesis and DCG and recover the assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This followed a letter from Genesis to its customers on December 7th, claiming that the withdrawal freeze was likely to last a few weeks while a solution was sought to recover users' assets. The freeze had been implemented on November 16th, citing "unprecedented market turmoil" caused by the collapse of FTX.</p>
<p>As crypto progresses deep into its winter it remains to be seen how the case will progress and whether the plaintiffs will be successful in their claims. The Winklevoss twins will no doubt be hoping that their exchange weathers the incoming storm.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The charity event is seeking to collect funds to benefit victims of the nervous system disease ALS, which the late Hal Finney himself was afflicted by.&nbsp;</p>
Charity Event Invites BTC Donations
<p>Hal Finney was one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, in 2009. He succumbed to the ravages of the disease and passed away from complications in 2014. On Tuesday, his widow Fran Finney took to her late husband&rsquo;s Twitter handle to announce the charity event, &ldquo;Running Bitcoin,&rdquo; a half marathon for Bitcoin holders to raise funds that would be contributed towards finding a cure for ALS. Those willing to participate would be covering a half-marathon distance between January 1st through 10th to raise funds through BTC donations for ALS research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are determined to find a cure for this devastating condition and any support you can provide will make a big difference&hellip;If you'd like to participate in the 'Running Bitcoin' event and make a donation, you can do so by visiting our website http://runningbitcoin.us and following the instructions there.&rdquo;</p>

More On &ldquo;Running Bitcoin&rdquo;
<p>It is interesting to note that the marathon name, &ldquo;Running Bitcoin,&rdquo; was informed by the first-ever tweet about the crypto made by Hal Finney himself, indicating how much of an early adopter he was. In fact, he was the second person to run a Bitcoin node after Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Finney tweeted those two words just a few days after Bitcoin went live in 2009. Prior to his diagnosis, Finney had frequently run distances. The Running Bitcoin website has also revealed that he especially favored the half marathon distance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notice on the website reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Join Honorary Chair Fran Finney and the Running Bitcoin Challenge Committee as we honor legendary cypher punk, Hal Finney. This is THE EVENT that combines Hal Finney's love of running and Bitcoin and is raising funds and awareness to help defeat ALS, which claimed his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other information on the event reveals that participants can complete the half marathon in one day or throughout the campaign duration. The website also collects donations in Bitcoin and fiat currency, where certain donators will receive certain benefits. A minimum $100 donation will earn a special event t-shirt, while the top 25 contributors will receive a Hal Finney collectible autographed by Fran Finney. The campaign has already raised $10,000 of its $50,000 goal.&nbsp;</p>
