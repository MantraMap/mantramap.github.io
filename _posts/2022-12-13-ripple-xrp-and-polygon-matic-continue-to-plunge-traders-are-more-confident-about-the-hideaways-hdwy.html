<p class="s6">Ripple (XRP) and Polygon (MATIC) price values have been swept into the FTX storm, ignoring the significant developments on both platforms.</p>
<p class="s6">On the other hand, The Hideaways (HDWY) has laid out a silver lining in the crypto community. The dramatic fall of the crypto exchange has driven XRP and MATIC investors to the presale superstar.</p>
<p class="s9">Ripple (XRP) Endures Ripple Effect of FTX&rsquo;s Troubles</p>
<p class="s6">Ripple (XRP) has been tireless in expanding its platform&rsquo;s presence worldwide, but FTX&rsquo;s contagion has dissolved support for the American-based crypto company.</p>
<p class="s6">In the past week, XRP has reported a decline of 15.30% to $0.382037, and it is about to close the year far behind its all-time high of $3.40. Correspondingly, Ripple is anticipated to end 2023 at $1.76.</p>
<p class="s6">The shock from Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s crypto exchange FTX sent leading crypto into a tailspin except for The Hideaways (HDWY), which has retained its bullish projections.</p>
<p class="s6">Accordingly, Ripple no longer derives most of its income from the United States as it reaches Europe, an effort to lessen the dragging impact of the market sell-off.</p>
<p class="s6">Ripple (XRP) was once the third-largest cryptocurrency, holding a $120.00 billion market value in 2018. However, XRP has declined sharply amid American regulatory scrutiny, which has unfolded a case from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p class="s9">Polygon (MATIC) Becomes Extra Bearish</p>
<p class="s6">Polygon (MATIC) has experienced significant declines this week despite its exceptional performance in terms of both business and performance. MATIC skidded 19.50% to $0.864124 in the past seven days.</p>
<p class="s6">Subsequently, the number of unique addresses on the Polygon network continues to gain, surpassing the 191-million-wallet mark.</p>
<p class="s6">However, Polygon (MATIC) failed to protect itself from the FTX contagion, moving its 2023 price predictions to $0.93.</p>
<p class="s6">Unlike MATIC and XRP, The Hideaways (HDWY) has resisted broader crypto factors. The new projects made waves in a revolutionary way in the real estate market.</p>
<p>Why The Hideaways (HDWY) Could Be A Game Changer In 2023?</p>
