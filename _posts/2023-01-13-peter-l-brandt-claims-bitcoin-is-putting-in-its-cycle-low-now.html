Career commodities trader Peter L. Brandt is now claiming that Bitcoin is putting in a &#8220;low for this cycle now,&#8221; according to a new TradingView post. This call for a bear market bottom is already being met with skepticism, but given the chilling accuracy at which Brandt had made related to his cryptocurrency bets in the past, there could be more validity than investors are ready to accept. Peter L. Brandt TradingView Post Calls For Cycle Low In BTC In a new TradingView post currently trending on the charting platform&#8217;s editor&#8217;s picks section, career commodities trader Peter L. Brandt says that the cycle lows for the crypto market are taking place &#8220;now.&#8221; Although Brandt doesn&#8217;t directly state that the bottom is already in, he does believe that Bitcoin&#8217;s behavior is &#8220;predictable&#8221; and should see a strong advance after the recent, nearly 80% decline.

Back then, Brandt called it a &#8220;general TA rule, eventually nailing his sub-$4,000 target some eleven months later in December of the same year.
