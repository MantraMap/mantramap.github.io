<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Robinhood will lay off around 7% of its full-time workers, or roughly 150 individuals, due to a lack of consumer engagement.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs were made to react to volume and better align team structures, according to Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick.</em></li>



<li><em>Robinhood&#8217;s user base has decreased as commodity prices have risen, and the business saw an increase in workers departing voluntarily.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/26/robinhood-cutting-7percent-of-its-full-time-employees-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em>, Robinhood, a stock and cryptocurrency trading platform, said on Monday that it will let off around 7% of its full-time workers, or about 150 individuals, owing to a fall in consumer engagement.</strong></h5>

<p>The trading platform was critical in the retail trading frenzy during the epidemic, but it has suffered with a shrinking user base as commodity prices have risen.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We’re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload,” Robinhood stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The layoffs were made to react to volume and better align team structures, according to Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick&#8217;s statement to the <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-lays-off-about-7-of-its-full-time-employees-2111cb48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WSJ</a></em>.</p>



<p>The announcement comes a week after the business announced the acquisition of financial technology startup X1 Inc for around $95 million in cash as it seeks fresh income streams to offset the deterioration in its primary trading segment.</p>

<p>Last year, Robinhood laid off over 1,000 employees in two waves of layoffs. According to its annual report, Robinhood has over 2,300 full-time workers as of the end of 2022.</p>



<p>According to Robinhood&#8217;s most recent quarterly report, the business saw an increase in workers departing voluntarily and a decrease in reported employee job satisfaction in the months after the layoffs last April and August.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/194416-robinhood-crypto-trading-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robinhood</a> has less than 11 million monthly active users as of May. Transaction-based revenue fell 5% year on year in the first quarter and was more than halved from the same period in 2021. The company exceeded Wall Street revenue projections in the most recent quarter, as the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s quick rate rises increased its interest income.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trading inside the OKX app was still available at the time of publishing. OKX has not yet announced a particular date for when the rule will go into effect.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX cryptocurrency exchange is ceasing services to Japanese users due to local laws and regulations.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance also announced last month that it will no longer provide services to Japanese citizens starting from November 30, 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>The Japanese government is still working on establishing regulations for cryptocurrency firms to operate in the country.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Coinpost, OKX is suspected of ceasing to provide services to Japanese users.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a notice in the app:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;OKX Exchange products are unavailable in Japan due to local laws and regulations. You can still sign up/log in, and access OKX Wallet. If you don&#8217;t reside in Japan, you may continue using OKX Exchange products with a valid government- issued ID.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trading inside the OKX app was still available at the time of publishing. OKX has not yet announced a particular date for when the rule will go into effect.</p>



<p>Binance, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, stated last month that it would no longer provide services to Japanese people.</p>



<p>Binance Global previously declared that the present service will be discontinued for Japanese citizens on November 30, 2023. Binance intends to build a Japanese-language platform in the summer of 2023.</p>

<p>Users in Japan transferred to Binance Japan from the global version in November of this year, and it seems that OKX, which does not have a license in Japan, was compelled to reply to the Financial Services Agency.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, OKX has <a href="https://coincu.com/192628-okx-partners-with-komainu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teamed</a> with Komainu, a digital asset storage provider, to allow institutional clients to keep their cryptocurrency in the Nomura-backed custodian while trading on the exchange. This is one of the strategic cooperation relationships to expand in Japan.</p>



<p>Japan is still establishing the necessary circumstances for crypto firms to operate. The National Tax Office revised the legislation on June 20 to exclude cryptocurrency issuers from paying a 30% business tax on unrealized profits on tokens. The tax reform comes as Japanese officials push programs to encourage the country&#8217;s blockchain and cryptocurrency industries.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Binance&#8217;s attempt to limit the SEC&#8217;s use of terms relating to Binance.US&#8217; handling of client money in press releases has been denied by Judge Amy Berman Jackson.</em></li>



<li><em>The judge rejected the company&#8217;s accusations that the SEC&#8217;s extrajudicial statements were misleading.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance&#8217;s attorneys had requested the judge to censure the SEC outside of court for biasing a jury, but the judge did not intervene.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A federal judge <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67474542/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-binance-holdings-limited/?order_by=desc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> Binance&#8217;s attempt to limit the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) use of terms relating to Binance.US&#8217; handling of client money in press releases, which the company contended may harm it in court.</strong></h5>

<p>On Friday, lawyers for BAM Trading, which trades as Binance.US, filed a complaint regarding the SEC&#8217;s news release, noting concerns about the SEC&#8217;s misleading extrajudicial statements.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s attorneys took issue with the SEC&#8217;s phrasing describing the alleged commingling or diversion of user money from trading platforms to investment entities that the agency claims CEO Changpeng Zhao controls.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1933.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1933.png" alt="Binance.US Lost As Judge Rejects Its Accusations Of SEC Misleading Statements" class="wp-image-197966" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1933.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1933-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1933-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1933-750x393.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance.US Lost As Judge Rejects Its Accusations Of SEC Misleading Statements 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District of Columbia District Court, who is presiding over the SEC&#8217;s action against <a href="https://coincu.com/197209-binanceus-now-reject-sec-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a>, rejected the accusations, stating that the court&#8217;s mission is not to wordsmith public remarks from any of the case&#8217;s parties.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It is not apparent that Court intervention … is needed at this time, or that it is necessary or appropriate for the Court to get involved in wordsmithing the parties&#8217; press releases. Nor is it clear that the agency&#8217;s public relations efforts to date will materially affect proceedings in this case,” Judge Jackson wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last week, the company&#8217;s lawyers requested Berman Jackson to censure the SEC outside of court for its characterization of the alleged abuse of billions of dollars in client funds, arguing that the news release may bias a jury.</p>

<p>The SEC filed a complaint against Binance, Binance.US, and CZ on June 5, saying that the exchanges supplied unregistered securities to US users and that Binance failed to register as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency. The federal regulator first requested that the court freeze all Binance.US assets but finally agreed to a compromise in which only the exchange&#8217;s workers would have access to customer cash.</p>

<p>The FTX Debtors&#8217; study is continuing, and the report is part of a series on pre-petition events and concerns that occurred prior to the Chapter 11 proceedings.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/197648-ftx-client-confidentiality-media-outcry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, Bloomberg, Dow Jones, the New York Times, and the Financial Times have appealed Judge John Dorsey&#8217;s June 9 order, which allowed FTX to &#8220;permanently remove&#8221; individual consumers from all records of the secret name and safeguard FTX&#8217;s legal rights.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs&#8217; counsel, attorney Kylie Chiseul Kim, just resigned from the lawsuit. The company stressed that the withdrawal was unrelated to the case. Similarly, John Deaton, the attorney representing thousands of XRP token holders in the Ripple litigation, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnedeaton1/status/1673348550334324736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that another lawyer was making a move:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Just got an email of a filing in the Ripple case and I must have admit, I got (butterflies) in my stomach. But it was just a lawyer withdrawing from the case.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the lawyer&#8217;s identity and the cause for the withdrawal remain unknown, Deaton verified receiving an email about it. Nonetheless, he said that this development was in no way indicative of a settlement or anything comparable. According to the attorney, a lawyer resigning from the SEC lawsuit &#8220;means nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the wait for Summary Judgment progressed, XRP token holders were enveloped in uncertainty. Still, there is a feeling of hope that <a href="https://coincu.com/197056-ripple-grants-license-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a> will prevail in the lawsuit, despite the fact that the summary judgment might be rendered as late as the end of 2023.</p>



<p>When asked whether a court date would be scheduled to give the final judgement, Deaton said that Ripple, the SEC, and all stakeholders will learn the verdict at the same time via a filing in the public docket. Nevertheless, Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; delay in delivering the Summary Judgment has sparked controversy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ripple&#8217;s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, has chastised the SEC for its conduct, citing a section of the US Electronic Code of Federal Regulations governing ethical standards for administrative staff in the executive arms of government.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance has reportedly withdrawn its application for registration with the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA).</em></li>



<li><em>The regulator is said to have exerted pressure in the background, and the expansion of Binance in Austria has failed due to difficulties in obtaining licenses in Europe.</em></li>



<li><em>Customers in Austria will not be affected by the withdrawal of the license application.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance has withdrawn its application for registration with the Austrian Financial Market Authority <strong>(FMA)</strong>, according to a report in the German online magazine <em>Finance Forward</em>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918-1024x576.png" alt="Binance Withdraws Approval In Austria Because Of Legal Pressure: Report" class="wp-image-197926" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1918.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Withdraws Approval In Austria Because Of Legal Pressure: Report 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>The licensing application was withdrawn some time ago, according to the exclusive information. According to the publication, the authorities are reported to have applied pressure in the background.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are unable to disclose details from our discussions with regulators, but we will continue to act in accordance with our commitments wherever Binance operates,&#8221; a spokesman is quoted as saying.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>About a year ago, Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s (CZ) crypto exchange revealed plans to expand to Austria, establishing Binance Austria GmbH in the spring. The exchange desired a license for its subsidiary. Unfortunately, its growth in Austria has also failed.</p>



<p>The Austrian regulator is said to have applied pressure behind the scenes. The corporation is alleged to have established Binance Austria GmbH last year with the intention of obtaining a license for the subsidiary.</p>

<p>Austria joins the list of European markets from which Binance has withdrawn in recent weeks. Binance is also under more scrutiny in Europe. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is now suing the world&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume. But, even in Europe, the stock market seems to be having difficulty securing permits.</p>



<p>The exchange holds Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) licenses in France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, and Lithuania, according to the official website. Within a month, the exchange had withdrawn or been forced to withdraw from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, <a href="https://coincu.com/197526-binance-ordered-to-stop-in-belgium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Belgium</a>, and Cyprus.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The good news is that withdrawing the application will have no effect on Austrian consumers. If Binance had gotten the license, it would have been permitted to conduct marketing and promotional operations in the nation, among other things.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After a fairly positive week with Bitcoin prices soaring above $30,000, the crypto market is looking forward to more important news this week. Investors remain cautious ahead of major events that could affect the market&#8217;s recent rally.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde Speaks</h2>



<p>On Monday and Tuesday, June 26 and 27, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will deliver talks on monetary policy and inflation problems in the Eurozone at the 2023 ECB Conference on Central Banking. ECB officials will also provide remarks on the prospects for monetary policy and measures to bring inflation to its goal at the 2023 ECB Conference on Central Banking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">US Treasury Department Auction</h2>



<p>The US Treasury Department will auction 3-month and 6-month treasury notes, as well as the 2-year treasury note, on June 26.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">New Home Sales Data</h2>



<p>The US Census Bureau will announce new home sales statistics for May on June 27.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Fed Chair Powell Speaks</h2>



<p>On June 28, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will deliver monetary policy speeches on Wednesday and Thursday, after the Fed held interest rates constant in June but projected rises later this year.</p>



<p>A few things were clear: the Fed isn&#8217;t done battling inflation, the emphasis of additional financial regulation will almost certainly be on the largest banks, and the central bank is still focused on its employment mission.</p>



<p>Democrats frequently reminded Powell of the Fed&#8217;s duty to attain full employment, emphasizing their concerns about job losses if the central bank goes too far. Meanwhile, Republican inquiries revealed their worries about upcoming financial regulations. Powell reiterated the Fed&#8217;s hawkish conviction that the fight against inflation is far from over. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 25 basis point rise in July with a 72% chance.</p>



<p>In addition, the Federal Reserve will reveal stress test findings on Wednesday to assess the resilience of banks.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>MAS and BIS have proposed a framework for open and interoperable networks for digital assets, with a focus on maintaining global financial stability.</em></li>



<li><em>The Project Guardian Industry Group, comprising 11 financial firms, is exploring asset tokenization across several financial asset classes through pilot studies in wealth management, fixed income, and foreign exchange.</em></li>



<li><em>MAS is proposing digital money standards, such as CBDCs and stablecoins, to leverage new technology while improving established financial systems.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Singapore Monetary Authority (MAS) has issued a paper suggesting a framework for open and interoperable networks for digital assets.

<p>Project Guardian, a MAS program, investigates the possibilities of asset tokenization across multiple financial asset classes. The Project Guardian Industry Group, comprised of 11 financial companies, including HSBC, Standard Chartered, DBS, and Citi, has been created to undertake pilot projects in wealth management, fixed income, and foreign exchange.</p>

<p>The paper focuses on the potential of DeFi apps and methods to convert physical assets into digital tokens without jeopardizing global financial stability and integrity.</p>



<p>Rather than emphasizing the benefits of private digital networks, the MAS report warned that public networks might be riskier since validators do not need permission or authorization from official regulatory organizations. Moreover, since there are no centralized restrictions over who may engage in them, it is believed that they are vulnerable to malevolent conduct.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The initial pilot trade conducted in collaboration with Singapore Exchange and Linklogis proves the viability of assets-backed tokenization as an innovative originate-to-distribute structure, and the potential opportunities it presents to investors to participate in financing real-world economic activity,&#8221; said Kai Fehr, Standard Chartered&#8217;s global head of trade and working capital.</p>

<p>Private networks have been lauded for being more restrictive, enabling only pre-approved groups to join. This creates a regulated environment in which all participants are recognized and trustworthy entities, lowering the possibility of fraudulent or dangerous behaviors.</p>

<p>In keeping with this, the MAS has suggested digital money standards, including central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins. The goal is to improve established financial systems while using the advantages of new technology.</p>



<p>By cooperating with prominent financial institutions, Singapore&#8217;s Project Guardian is transforming the digital asset sector. Asset tokenization will offer up new opportunities by using open and interoperable networks. Pilot studies in wealth management, fixed income, and foreign exchange will give useful information on the advantages of tokenized digital assets.</p>
