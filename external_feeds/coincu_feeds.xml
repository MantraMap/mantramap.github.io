<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>With aspirations to develop a cooperative decentralizing staking pool, Diva just closed a $3.5 million seed round sponsored by A&amp;T Capital.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol is designed to provide benefits to both inactive investors and full-time node operators, with awards being socialized over the network to produce consistent and predictable reward rates.</em></li>



<li><em>In contrast to the centralized delegated pools of today, Diva&#8217;s DVT incorporates a number of advances to provide truly decentralized staking.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>A community-driven Liquid Staking system called <a href="https://divalabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diva</a> has <a href="https://divalabs.medium.com/here-comes-the-diva-liquid-staking-powered-by-distributed-validators-9e5c3bd38896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finished</a> raising seed capital and will shortly go live on the Ethereum mainnet.</strong></h5>

<p>The first product offering a <strong>Liquid Staking Derivative (divETH)</strong> driven entirely by<strong> Distributed Validation Technology is Diva (DVT)</strong>.</p>



<p>Participants earn a <strong>1:1 ratio</strong> of <strong>divETH</strong>, a freely transferable liquid asset, in exchange for staking <strong>ETH</strong> on <strong>Diva</strong>. Staker wallets tally up any <strong>divETH</strong> rewards on a daily basis. After <strong>the March 2023</strong> <strong>Capella</strong> <strong>update</strong>, <strong>DivETH</strong> can be unstaked and exchanged for <strong>ETH</strong> at any time, once more at a<strong> 1:1 ratio</strong>.</p>



<p>On Diva, nodes form groups by posting bonds totaling<strong> 1 ETH </strong>and working together. A full validation node is formed when each group of <strong>16 nodes </strong>is matched against <strong>16 ETH</strong> from diverse network stakers.</p>



<p>When ETH is put into <strong>Diva</strong>, it is added to additional deposits to meet the<strong> 32 ETH</strong> threshold for <strong>Ethereum</strong> <strong>Validators</strong>. Using its P2P consensus layer, the <strong>Node</strong> <strong>Operators</strong> are responsible for managing these validators.</p>



<p>Thanks to its built-in economic incentives and the cryptographic nature of the <strong>MPC DKG</strong> threshold signatures, the platform is tolerant of censorship, outages, and malicious assaults.</p>

<p>In contrast to the centralized delegated pools of today, its <strong>DVT</strong> incorporates a number of advances to provide true decentralized staking.</p>



<p><strong>Staked.vc, Gnosis, Bankless, OKX Ventures, Metaweb, DCV Capital, Alphemy Capital, Very Early Ventures,</strong> and angel investors from projects like <strong>Metacartel</strong>, <strong>Aave, Staking Rewards, zkEVM, ZKValidator, EthGlobal, EigenLayer, Aragon,</strong> and <strong>Stakely</strong> contributed to the <strong>$3.5 million seed round</strong>, which was led by<strong> A&amp;T Capital</strong>.</p>



<p>On <strong>January 23</strong>, the project will make its private testnet available to the public. A preliminary version of Diva is now being audited by its development team, and its mainnet release is anticipated in the coming months.</p>

<p>Solana Foundation, Ripple, and GBBC have formed partnership to support crypto climate change solutions. <strong>The Blockchain x Climate Leadership Network (BxC)</strong> is a new non-profit organization that intends to be &#8220;the greatest single collective gathering of climate action innovators, leaders, and builders worldwide.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>In the fall of 2022</strong>, BxC, formerly known as the Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offsetting Working Group (BICOWG), brought together members from major cryptocurrency and environmental organizations in Colombia. Some of the working groups formed at that meeting are still active today and will form the foundation of BxC. These groups are working on <strong>carbon market registries, standards and auditability, policy formulation, regenerative finance, and emerging markets in the global south.</strong></p>



<p>This year, the presence of cryptocurrency on the promenade outside<strong> the main forum center is comparably low</strong>, and the sector is making a determined effort to draw attention to initiatives with real-world applications and social benefit.</p>

<p>According to Hwang &#8211; BxC strategic adviser, who works on creating the infrastructure for the initiative, such as carbon credit measurements, which <strong>calculate the lowered amount of greenhouse gases produced by human actions</strong>, his team has been gathering every week for the last two and a half years hosting workshops and forums concentrated on education. The initiative aims to <strong>formulate principles of collaboration and methodologies for climate-related blockchain activities in many sectors</strong>, as well as business applications for climate-crypto enterprises.</p>



<p>Efforts to use cryptocurrency to promote climate change mitigation efforts are mostly focused on<strong> developing new economies that do not affect the environment.</strong> The Solana Foundation and Ripple are founding partners, while the environmentally conscious<strong> layer 1 blockchain Regen Network</strong> and the environmental advocacy group Climate Collective are supporting partners. <strong>The program will be led by GBBC and Eqo Networks</strong>, which specializes in developing such climate-conscious leadership networks. The crypto climate is looking forward to the positive change after the collaboration among the three organizations which are Solana, Ripple, and GBBC</p>

<p>According to TaxBit CEO <strong>Austin Woodward</strong>, this will make it easier for institutional customers to manage the process of tracking cryptocurrency transactions and pricing for reporting, which should enable customers to close their books in days rather than months.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;TaxBit historically focused on top-of-market Enterprises, but it became evident that businesses of all sizes accepting, trading, or holding digital assets are in need of automated accounting solutions. As we got to know Tactic, it was clear that their world-class technical team, products, and culture perfectly align with what we are building and how we operate at TaxBit,&#8221; Woodward said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With a single system of records for crypto tax and accounting, <strong>TaxBit</strong> was established in <strong>2018</strong>. In contrast, <strong>Tactic</strong> was introduced in <strong>2021</strong> to assist companies in maintaining their accounting procedures. According to Woodward, Tactic&#8217;s personnel and software will fully integrate with TaxBit over the upcoming months.</p>

<p>To cut down on crypto accounting operations by as much as <strong>75%</strong>, <strong>Tactic</strong> offers accounting automation tools, seamless interaction with other financial software packages, and enhanced visibility.</p>



<p>The acquisition follows a period of intense unrest in the markets for digital assets. The mission-critical requirement for transparency, especially in the form of auditable and verifiable accounting, has been underscored by recent crypto market occurrences. With cutting-edge and legal solutions for tracking, processing, and reporting transactions, <strong>TaxBit</strong> can assist in regaining investor confidence as regulations change and scrutiny rises.</p>

<p>This exchange has implemented the <strong>BNB Auto-Burn burning mechanism</strong>, which promises to help <strong>build a healthy blockchain ecosystem together with the BSC &amp; BNB community</strong>. Currently, there are two main mechanisms for burning BNB. First, part of the gas fee spent on BSC is burned in real time as introduced in <strong>BEP95</strong>. Since Binance did the Bruno upgrade for BNB<strong> on November 30, 2021</strong>,<strong> BSC burns around 860 BNB per day</strong>.</p>



<p>Second, the exchange burns BNB quarterly based on its “<strong>accelerated BNB burn</strong>” plan, with last quarter being the 17th time the exchange burned<strong> 1,335,888 BNB from circulation</strong>. And in the future, Binance&#8217;s quarterly BNB burn plan will be replaced by BNB Auto-Burn.</p>



<p>According to Binance, “BNB Auto-Burn will be objective and verifiable, independent of the revenue generated on the platform through the use of BNB, and will automatically adjust where the burn amount will be based on,”. BNB price, accordingly, will reflect the supply and demand for BNB, as well as the number of blocks produced in a quarter calculated on the basis of on-chain information.</p>

<p>Polygon has grown in popularity as <strong>a platform for high-profile</strong>, branded drops such as <strong>Starbucks, Reddit, and former U.S. President Donald Trump&#8217;s digital trading card collection</strong>. Polygon is an Ethereum sidechain that enables faster and less expensive transactions. Polygon said it has recruited <strong>Xternity</strong>, a business that attempts to <strong>expedite the process of onboarding gamers</strong> to web3 platforms with products and services like as a crypto wallet for holding in-game assets, to help with<strong> Synergy Land&#8217;s move</strong>.</p>

<p>According to Sagi Maman, CEO and co-founder of Xternity, his company intends to expedite blockchain game development by allowing developers to &#8220;<strong>select their own environment</strong>&#8221; and gamers to feel <strong>ownership of digital assets.</strong></p>



<p>Synergy Land is a role-playing game under development <strong>by Synergy Games</strong> that takes place in a fantasy world divided into four ecosystems: earth, water, fire, and ice. The player will assume the role of a hero, exploring dungeons with up to four other players on a great adventure against very powerful creatures, using a fully dynamic and innovative spell system that will allow players to combine elements to cast spells, creating new beneficial or harmful synergies.</p>



<p>Synergy Land is currently a small project that <strong>hopes to complete a &#8220;Initial Game Offering&#8221; by the end of the first quarter of this year,</strong> according to a business release. A team of 25 people is in charge of the game&#8217;s development.</p>

<p>A decentralized protocol called <strong>IPFS</strong> is used to store and share data, and it uses content-addressing to identify files in a certain way. The <strong>Filecoin</strong> <strong>network</strong>, a decentralized storage network fueled by cryptocurrencies, is built on the IPFS protocol.</p>



<p>The mission will showcase an IPFS use case for space-to-ground communication. Through the use of IPFS, data from space will be content-addressed and made accessible on the IPFS network. Applications using IPFS will be able to access the data without having to know the precise position of the ground station hosting the data by leveraging the IPFS network.</p>



<p>Space-to-space communication is one of several use cases, architectures, and topologies for which the IPFS software layer is intended to be useful. The software is being developed publicly under an open-source license.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>To create Forkast Labs, a media intelligence platform for the digital economy that combines journalism and on-chain data analytics, Forkast.News and CryptoSlam are uniting.</em></li>



<li><em>Because there was no established way to calculate the true worth of digital assets, Forkast Labs was founded.</em></li>



<li><em>By creating a new benchmark, Forkast Labs aims to assess the genuine worth of Web3 and the digital economy.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Forkast Labs, a media intelligence platform for the digital economy that combines on-chain data analytics and journalism, will be <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/01/17/2589581/0/en/CryptoSlam-and-Forkast-News-to-Form-New-Data-Intelligence-Platform-Forkast-Labs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">created</a> through the merger of Web3 media company Forkast.News and blockchain data analytics company CryptoSlam, according to a January 17 announcement at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Forkast</strong> <strong>Labs</strong> was founded because there is currently no accepted approach for estimating the underlying value of digital assets, which are typically valued using crypto prices, leading to sentiment-driven volatility.</p>



<p>According to a press release, the two, which are portfolio businesses of the world&#8217;s largest software investment firm <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157076-animoca-brands-farewell-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animoca Brands</a>, will develop data tools, indices, and methodologies to value the digital economy in addition to providing reporting and analysis.</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that the deal was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-17/animoca-s-cryptoslam-forkast-news-merge-in-crypto-consolidation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">steered</a> by<strong> Yat Siu</strong>, the founder and executive chairman of <strong>Animoca Brands</strong>. The agreement&#8217;s terms weren&#8217;t made public.</p>



<p><strong>Forkast</strong> <strong>Labs</strong> wants to create a new benchmark for determining the real worth of Web3 and the digital economy by combining on-chain data intelligence and the media.</p>



<p>The new company will begin by releasing data indices, <strong>APIs</strong>, and business intelligence tools to gauge the digital economy using real-time on-chain data, establishing a common framework for investors to assess blockchain initiatives.</p>



<p><strong>Angie Lau</strong>, a former Bloomberg anchor and the creator of Forkast.News, and<strong> Randy Wasinger</strong>, the creator of CryptoSlam, will serve as <strong>co-CEOs</strong> of <strong>Forkast Labs</strong>. Co-founder of Forkast.News<strong> Sarah Chang</strong> will serve as <strong>COO</strong> of the new company.</p>



<p><strong>Angie Lau </strong>said in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/01/17/2589581/0/en/CryptoSlam-and-Forkast-News-to-Form-New-Data-Intelligence-Platform-Forkast-Labs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This merger comes at a pivotal moment for the crypto industry.

<p>Launched in 2018, <strong>CryptoSlam</strong> is one of the most-used trackers of transactions of <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</strong>. For the data provider, <strong>Animoca</strong> led a <strong>$9 million</strong> seed round one year ago.

<p>For the quarter, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160264-silvergate-sued-securities-law-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silvergate</a> reported a net loss of <strong>$1.05 billion</strong> as opposed to a profit of <strong>$18.4 million</strong> at the same time last year.

<p>The report states that in the fourth quarter of 2022, customers deposited an average of <strong>$7.3 billion </strong>in digital assets. Deposits were approximately <strong>$12 billion</strong> in the third quarter of 2022, which is a big decrease from this.</p>

<p>The business reported a <strong>$949 million</strong> <strong>loss</strong> for the entire year of 2022 as opposed to a net income of <strong>$75.5 million</strong> in <strong>2021</strong>.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s announcement that it had eliminated <strong>40% of its workforce </strong>and seen an <strong>$8.1 billion outflow of customer deposits of digital assets</strong> at the beginning of January predicted the bank&#8217;s performance for the most recent quarter.

Japan&#8217;s rules have helped to shield investors, who are willing to be able to withdraw their funds from FTX&#8217;s local subsidiary next month.</p>



<p>Regarding the recent event that shocked the crypto world &#8211; the collapse of the FTX exchange and Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s empire &#8211; <strong>Yanase</strong>, who has also worked in banking supervision, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“What’s brought about the latest scandal isn’t crypto technology itself. It is loose governance, lax internal controls, and the absence of regulation and supervision.”</p>
