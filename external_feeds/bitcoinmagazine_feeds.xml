Does anyone remember these? FitFlops sold for some $100 and promised to work your legs into shape just by walking. Seeing them made me recall the time I spent traveling across Asia from around 2008 onward. </p><p>In those years and into the early 2010s, I was busy managing a company based in Hong Kong while accompanying my then boyfriend/fiancé around Asia. He worked on various finance projects with governments in the region, flashing his MBA, two master’s degrees and finance background while I occupied my days, and some nights, with corporate matters and adding to my investment portfolio. In those days, that meant investing in various equities, some Asian venture capital funds and an occasional seed funding opportunity.</p><p>Apart from that, I also did some modeling for advertisements and through this I earned my “play” money. And, what did I intend to do with my “play” money? I wanted to invest in bitcoin.</p><h2>My First Steps</h2><p>In 2010, with Bitcoin’s <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block">genesis block</a> having been mined just one year prior, I came across some stories about this wonder-currency. I was intrigued and interested in investing. I struggled trying to find enough information and to sort through the comments for and against it. The challenges were massive. It seemed easier just to forget about it and go drink another espresso. </p><p>How could I invest? How could I sort through the many technical aspects? I felt like I needed to have a degree in programming. Moreover, I had concerns that if I did figure out where to buy it and how to hold it, then was I going to get some virus on my PC as a result or be pursued by someone from the dark side after I did? Could I be subjected to the many scams or hacks that I was reading about? </p><p>It is sad to think, however, that even 14 years since the genesis block, some of these impediments remain for many people, stifling greater Bitcoin adoption. </p><h2>Asking The ‘Expert’</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, my then boyfriend/fiancé was apparently a financial expert. I mean, he was advising governments on their finances and economic development. He had been investing in stock markets since he was a teenager. So, why not ask him for help and his thoughts? </p><p>One weekend while in Singapore, I sprung the news and my questions. I recall that day so vividly. I mentioned Bitcoin and my desire to buy $100 worth and sell it after it grew to $1,000 worth. I thought it was fine to gamble a small amount because, even if I lost it all, I would somehow survive the loss… perhaps with only a few hours spent at a therapist. </p><p>Anyway, this is what I heard: </p><p>“What? Bitcoin? That’s just for use by scammers and prostitutes.” </p><p>OK, I forgot to ask how he knew that but, anyway, the discussion continued. I chalked his abrupt comment up to the fact that he had just finished drinking a double-shot, tall cappuccino with one pump of hazelnut syrup and was hyped full of caffeine and sugar. </p><p>I replied that I have researched it and understood that it is a token for the gaming sector, an industry that was growing fast. It can increase in value, I added. It can maybe reach $10 someday! I then also reminded him that he promised to buy me a gift — yes, the elusive FitFlops — when next in Singapore. I said that, rather than buying me those magic shoes, I will just use the money to buy bitcoin instead. Now, I could have easily bought bitcoin with my own money, but I wanted to do this as a mutual decision, for the future. And I was not a financial expert, so I thought it still best to seek his input. The discussion continued and I finally got him to agree to research Bitcoin further with me. </p><h2>Boyfriend/Expert/Panicked Investor</h2><p>Over the next few days, we both tried to find more information on Bitcoin and possible on-ramps. I found one small and seemingly-elusive Bitcoin group in Singapore. It seemed at that time that to buy some bitcoin, you had to know the right people. </p><p>I felt that, at least since this group was in Singapore, a highly-policed and -regulated state, that I would not be subject to the many scam sales and post-purchase hacks to steal the coins that existed back then. </p><p>I wondered how to get in touch with the group and even if I did, how could I know that they were for real? Nonetheless, I was willing to take a chance since I would only put in around $100, just my FitFlop money. My boyfriend/fiancé/expert had a different view. He was old-style, a conservative investor. He was one who followed the Warren Buffett approach. Remember, Warren Buffett <a href="https://financialpost.com/investing/buffetts-apple-losses-make-his-track-record-in-tech-even-worse">didn’t invest in any technology stocks until relatively late</a>. The potential to lose $100 sent him into a panic, even if the upside could turn that into $1,000!</p><h2>Wearing Bitcoin On My Feet</h2><p>After finally breaking down my Warren Buffett protégé/panicked boyfriend into agreeing to consider Bitcoin, I tried to reach the elusive Bitcoin group. No email replies, no phone numbers, no address to visit. It seemed that the only outcome of my Singaporean Bitcoin adventure would be to own a pair of FitFlops. My outreach and research continued over the next few days but to no avail. It appeared that Bitcoin, and the potential to make big returns, would have to be saved for a select few techies or traditional wealthy insiders. I left Singapore wearing what should have been my bitcoin on my feet. </p><h2>My First Bitcoin And My Last FitFlops</h2><p>The years passed. I tried to occasionally catch an article or other news about Bitcoin. Even as I learned more about how to buy and hold it, I was busy working and traveling and found it impossible to find any trustworthy Bitcoin sources to invest in across developing Asia. The region was not the best place to do such research. Even after the founding of some crypto exchanges, they did not serve customers outside the U.S. </p><p>The start of my Bitcoin journey had to wait until around 2019. While I missed out on the early days of Bitcoin, I can at least take solace that my feet have been happy and comfortable over the decade. </p><p>Finally, you might now ask what happened to my then boyfriend-slash-fiancé? Well, that’s for another article…</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Enza Coin.

The gathering, organized by NGO <a href="https://bitcoinargentina.org/">Bitcoin Argentina</a>, marks the organization's ten-year anniversary and aims to promote the advantages of Bitcoin and the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>With the support of numerous companies and organizations in the sector, thousands of participants are expected to send a strong message about monetary and financial freedom. Jimena Vallone, the executive director of Bitcoin Argentina, expressed her excitement about the event, stating, "June 10 will be historic for the crypto community. For the first time, a giant human '₿' will be assembled with thousands of people to show that in the face of a world in crisis, unstable, the crypto industry is stronger than ever."</p><figure>

Assange, who is wanted on 18 charges related to the release of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables, will, however, renew his appeal next week according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/julian-assange-loses-us-extradition-challenge-will-renew-appeal-next-week-2023-06-09/">report by Reuters</a>. The British High Court ruled that Assange had no legal grounds to challenge the extradition decision.</p><p>Previously, a British judge ruled against Assange's extradition, citing concerns about his mental health and the risk of suicide if held in a maximum security prison. However, the decision was overturned on appeal after the U.S. authorities provided assurances, including the possibility of transferring Assange to Australia to serve any sentence.</p><p>WikiLeaks gained prominence in 2010 for releasing classified files and diplomatic cables, marking one of the largest security breaches in U.S. military history. As a journalist, Assange’s platform highlighted war crimes and incredible breaches of public trust by the U.S. military. His efforts to bring crimes and actions committed by the government to light have been met with furious retaliation despite the protections journalists should receive, even when reporting on sensitive information. To punish Assange for his work is to set the precedent that journalists who delve too deeply into government affairs will be made an example of. </p><p>Assange's case has drawn international attention and sparked debates regarding freedom of the press and the potential implications for whistleblowers. The renewed appeal next week will be a crucial moment in determining Assange's fate as he continues to fight against extradition to the United States.</p><figure>

In 2000, he launched Echovox, which he spun out into Zong in 2008 — a mobile platform that let users pay for things online directly through their mobile phone bills. When this venture was acquired by PayPal in 2011, Marcus joined the digital payments giant, becoming its president the next year.</p><p>He’d read the Bitcoin white paper shortly after it was published, but “didn’t fall into the rabbit hole” at first, he recalled in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. Then, in 2012, Argentina ordered PayPal to stop all transactions that would send money out of the country as it grappled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_fiscal_austerity_in_Argentina">currency inflation and a fiscal austerity effort</a>, and the real value of this peer-to-peer electronic cash system started to resonate with him.</p><p>“We had to (comply), we were a regulated entity,” Marcus explained. “The day that happened, bitcoin prices went up significantly and I was like, ‘Whoa.’ Like, this is something where consumers in a place like Argentina are actually rushing into bitcoin as a way to move money that they’ve earned — it’s their money — in a way that they saw fit. So, I felt that was a very eye-opening moment for me in terms of Bitcoin being an escape valve to certain behaviors that weren’t aligned with my views of self sovereignty, of money … so that was kind of a turning point for me in 2013, where it really solidified my conviction.”</p><p>Shortly afterward, in May 2013, he attended the <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/5/prweb10692708.htm">Bitcoin 2013 conference</a> in San Jose and, despite its relatively small community, he was intrigued by the breakthrough Bitcoin had made in how digital payments could be facilitated. </p><p>“It was really a handful, like two handfuls of people basically, it was so incredibly early,” he said. “I was fascinated by this general idea that you move value in a completely self-sovereign way without any intermediaries whatsoever. And during that same time period, I remember sending and receiving bitcoins, and I was setting up wallets for friends to show them what was possible: ‘Look, this is me sending you money and there’s no one in between, right?’ And I was really fascinated by it.”</p><h2>To The Best Of Our Abilities</h2><p>But Marcus was not yet ready to give up on the possibility of institutionalized yet open payments for the internet. In June 2014, he joined Meta (then Facebook) as its vice president of messaging products, developing the Facebook Messenger mobile app. Marcus released <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/fb-better-have-my-money">Messenger P2P Payments</a> in 2015, which allowed users to send each other money from their synced checking accounts via the app. </p><p>By mid-2019, Marcus had begun leading Facebook’s cryptocurrency project, Libra, which was later renamed Diem before being abandoned altogether. Libra was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/facebooks-libra-is-here-but-it-might-not-be-what-you-think">almost instantly dismissed by Bitcoiners</a> as offering nothing particularly valuable compared to other centralized digital currency projects. And Marcus found himself defending the project before <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/libra-congress-chance-define-bitcoin-libra-isnt">the House Financial Services Committee</a> as well as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/senate-hearing-facebooks-iffy-reputation-looms-libra-plans">the U.S. Senate’s banking committee</a>, forced to answer questions that were often more broadly focused on Meta’s history of invading user privacy.</p><p>But before Libra settled on the permissioned, oligarchical node model <a href="https://sls.gmu.edu/pfrt/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/LibraWhitePaper_en_US-Rev0723.pdf">outlined in its white paper</a>, Marcus had actually considered leveraging the Lightning Network for his project.</p><p>“I remember meeting with Elizabeth Stark (CEO of Lightning Network development firm Lightning Labs) in early 2018 and trying to figure out whether Lightning was actually the way to go, because if there was a way to actually use Bitcoin, I really wanted to do that,” Marcus said. “At the time, we thought, OK, maybe we can use Lightning and then build a world-class wallet that we can embed across all of the Meta products, WhatsApp and Messenger and others, and then enable people to move value around.”</p><p>Ultimately, he decided the protocol wasn’t robust enough to fulfill Meta’s vision due to some of the insufficiencies that it has yet to overcome, including limited nodes and liquidity.</p><p>“Even today, it would be challenging, and it will be challenging, to actually get to billions of consumers on the Lightning Network,” Marcus pointed out. “Even Layer 1 won’t have enough HTLCs (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts">hash time locked contracts</a>) to actually do that. So, we’ll have to find solutions as we get there. But our view was that it won’t scale… And as such, we came to the conclusion that we need to go build this proprietary technology that we will then do whatever we can to decentralize to the best of our abilities.”</p><p>In the end, Marcus’ ability to decentralize a payments project under Meta proved insufficient and he has since come to the realization that attempting to do so on any other network aside from Bitcoin is an exercise in futility.</p><p>“We’ve built the unshakeable conviction at this point that the only blockchain and the only underlying assets that can support a truly open protocol for payments on the internet is Bitcoin and nothing else,” he said.</p><p>In 2021, Marcus left Meta and the next year he launched Lightspark to pursue that conviction.</p><h2>The Reason Bitcoin And Lightning Are Better</h2><p>Lightspark builds software and development tools meant to make accessing the Lightning Network easier, such as its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lightspark-introduces-lightspark-wallet-sdk">software development kit</a> to help businesses offer Lightning wallets to their customers and <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/products">Lightspark Predict</a>, which identifies the best-performing Lightning nodes and can route transactions to them.</p><p>Rather than building a centralized platform to enable digital payments, Lightspark is focused on building tools to help customers access this existing, decentralized one. And while Lightning Network adoption is still far from rivaling the user base of something like PayPal, Marcus is optimistic about its potential to scale if companies like his are successful.</p><p>“Lightning still has issues, but I feel very confident that we’re in a position to address these issues,” he said. “You’ll see that for companies to integrate on Lightning using Lightspark services, you don’t even need to worry about channels. You don’t need to worry about liquidity. You don’t need to worry about channel rebalancing and distributing liquidity. You don’t need to worry about what routes you’re going to use and which minimum fee or maximum fee you’re going to set. All of that complexity is being completely taken away from the equation of a company deciding whether they’re going to implement Lightning for their consumers or not.”</p><p>When asked if abstracting users so far away from managing their own liquidity, channel balances and routing could in a sense recreate the issues with centralized, trusted financial middlemen, Marcus responded with an analogy.</p><p>“In the early days of the web, if you wanted a website and you wanted to be on the internet, you had to go build your own server, find a rack, put it in a rack, buy a router, configure your router, get an E1 or a T1 line, plug that router into your E1 or T1 line and then maintain that whole thing all the time, and it was like, OK, no one does that,” he explained. “But the reason Lightning and Bitcoin are better is because there are companies like Lightspark that will make things easier for mass market adoption, but if you are in a random country anywhere, and you just have internet connectivity, you can run a node on your phone yourself and be a participant in this network. And I think that’s what makes it amazing.”</p><p>And he went further to underscore that his intention now is to enable a certain kind of Lightning adoption, rather than roll out a solution that minimizes the need for independent participants. </p><p>“We don’t expect everyone to use our software,” he continued. “That would actually be a bad thing, right? We think that everyone should run their own thing and we’re going to cater to a certain segment of the market that is going to tend to be larger, enterprise-types of customers.”</p><p>Of all the executives actively working on Bitcoin projects, Marcus probably has the most legacy experience to inform him on what Bitcoin needs to succeed as well as what it must avoid in order not to fail. And, declaring that building on Lightning is the culmination of his life’s work, he’s determined to succeed.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4NTQ0NDMzNTE4NDg2OTc5/david-marcus.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[If We’re Not Careful, The AI Revolution Could Become The ‘Great Homogenization’]]></title><description><![CDATA[As artificial intelligence grows, so do attempts to control it.

They are either the naive delusions of technologists who believe God is in the circuits, or the deliberate incitement of fear and hysteria by more malevolent people with ulterior motives.</p><p>I <em>do not</em> think AGI is a threat or that we have an “AI safety problem,” or that we’re around the corner from some singularity with machines. </p><p><em>But…</em></p><p>I do believe this technological paradigm shift poses a significant threat to humanity — which is in fact, about the <em>only</em> thing I can somewhat agree on with the mainstream — but for completely different reasons. </p><p>To learn what they are, let’s first try to understand what's really happening here.</p><h2>Introducing… The Stochastic Parrot!</h2><p>Technology is an amplifier. It makes the good better, and the bad worse.</p><p>Just as a hammer is technology that can be used to build a house or beat someone over the head, computers can be used to document ideas that change the world, or they can be used to operate central bank digital currencies (CDBCs) that enslave you into crazy, communist cat ladies working at the European Central Bank.</p><p>The same goes for AI. It is a tool. It is a technology. It is <em>not</em> a new lifeform, despite what the lonely nerds who <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">are calling for progress to shut down</a> so desperately want to believe. </p><p>What makes generative AI so interesting is not that it is sentient, but that it’s the first time in our history that we are “speaking” or communicating with something other than a human being, in a coherent fashion. The closest we’ve been to that before this point has been with… parrots. </p><p>Yes: <em>parrots</em>!</p><p>You can train a parrot to kind of talk and talk back, and you can kind of understand it, but because we know it’s not really a human and doesn’t really understand anything, we’re not so impressed.</p><p>But generative AI… well, that’s a different story. We’ve been acquainted with it for six months now (in the mainstream) and we have no real idea how it works under the hood. We type some words, and it responds like that annoying, politically-correct, midwit nerd who you know from class… or your average Netflix show.</p><p>In fact, you’ve probably even spoken with someone like this during support calls to Booking.com, or any other service in which you’ve had to dial in or web chat. As such, you’re immediately shocked by the responses. </p><p>“Holy shit,” you tell yourself. “This thing speaks like a real person!”</p><p>The English is immaculate. No spelling mistakes. Sentences make sense. It is not only grammatically accurate, but semantically so, too.</p><p><em>Holy shit! It must be alive!</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>Little do you realize that you are speaking to a highly-sophisticated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot">stochastic parrot</a>. As it turns out, language is a little more rules-based than what we all thought, and probability engines can actually do an excellent job of <em>emulating</em> intelligence through the frame or conduit of language.</p><p>The law of large numbers strikes again, and math achieves another victory!</p><p>But… what does this mean? What the hell is my point? </p><p>That this is not useful? That it’s proof it’s not a path to AGI?</p><p>Not necessarily, on both counts.</p><p>There is lots of utility in such a tool. In fact, the greatest utility probably lies in its application as “MOT,” or “Midwit Obsolescence Technology.” Woke journalists and the countless “content creators” who have for years been talking a lot but saying nothing, are now like dinosaurs watching the comet incinerate everything around them. It’s a beautiful thing. Life wins again.</p><p>Of course, these tools are also great for ideating, coding faster, doing some high-level learning, etc.</p><p>But from an AGI and consciousness standpoint, <em>who knows?</em> There mayyyyyyyyyyy be a pathway there, but my spidey sense tells me we’re way off, so I’m not holding my breath. I think consciousness is so much more complex, and to think we’ve conjured it up with probability machines is some strange blend of ignorant, arrogant, naive and… well… empty.</p><p>So, what the hell is my problem and what’s the risk?</p><h2>Enter The Age Of The LUI</h2><p>Remember what I said about tools.</p><p>Computers are arguably the most powerful tool mankind has built. And computers have gone through the following evolution:</p><ol><li>Punch cards</li><li>Command line</li><li>Graphical user interface, i.e., point and click</li><li>Mobile, i.e., thumbs and tapping</li></ol><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Source: Author</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>And now, we’re moving into the age of the LUI, or “Language User Interface.”</p><p><em>This</em> is the big paradigm shift. It’s not AGI, but LUI. Moving forward, every app we interact with will have a conversational interface, and we will no longer be limited by the bandwidth of how fast our fingers can tap on keys or screens. </p><p>Speaking “language” is orders of magnitude faster than typing and tapping. Thinking is probably another level higher, but I’m not putting any electrodes into my head anytime soon. In fact, LUIs probably obsolete the need for Neuralink-type tech because the risks associated with implanting chips into your brain will outweigh any marginal benefit over just speaking.</p><p>In any case, this decade we will go from tapping on graphical user interfaces, to talking to our apps.</p><p>And therein lies the danger.</p><p>In the same way Google today determines what we see in searches, and Twitter, Facebook, Tik Tok and Instagram all “feed us” through their feeds; generative AI will tomorrow determine the answers to every question we have.</p><p>The screen not only becomes the lens through which you ingest everything about the world. The screen becomes your model of the world.</p><p>Mark Bisone <a href="https://markbisone.substack.com/p/screen-grab">wrote a fantastic article</a> about this recently, which I urge you to read:</p><blockquote><p>“The problem of ‘screens’ is actually a very old one. In many ways it goes back to Plato’s cave, and perhaps is so deeply embedded in the human condition that it precedes written languages. That’s because when we talk about a screen, we’re really talking about the transmission of an illusory model in an editorialized form.</p><p>“The trick works like this: You are presented with the image of a thing (and these days, with the sound of it), which its presenter either explicitly tells you or strongly implies is a window to the Real. The shadow and the form are the same, in other words, and the former is to be trusted as much as any fragment of reality that you can directly observe with your sensory organs.”</p></blockquote><p>And, for those thinking that “this won’t happen for a while,” well <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/g7-leaders-confirm-need-governance-generative-ai-technology-2023-05-19/">here are the bumbling fools making a good attempt at it</a>.</p><h2>The ‘Great Homogenization’</h2><p>Imagine every question you ask, every image you request, every video you conjure up, every bit of data you seek, being returned in such a way that is deemed “safe,” “responsible” or “acceptable” by some faceless “safety police.”</p><p>Imagine every bit of information you consume has been transformed into some lukewarm, middle version of the truth, that every opinion you ask for is not really an opinion or a viewpoint, but some inoffensive, apologetic response that doesn’t actually tell you anything (this is the benign, annoying version) or worse, is some ideology wrapped in a response so that everything you know becomes some variation of what the manufacturers of said “safe AI” want you to think and know.</p><p>Imagine you had modern Disney characters, like those clowns from “The Eternals” movie, as your ever-present intellectual assistants. It would make you “dumb squared.”</p><p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/UnCommunist-Manifesto-Message-Responsibility-Liberty/dp/0578396300">The UnCommunist Manifesto</a>” outlined the utopian communist dream as the grand homogenization of man:<em> </em></p><p><em>If only everyone were a series of numbers on a spreadsheet, or automatons with the same opinion, it would be so much easier to have paradise on earth. You could ration out just enough for everyone, and then we’d be all equally miserable proletariats.</em></p><p>This is like George Orwell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Police">thought police</a> crossed with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">Inception</a>,” because every question you had would be perfectly captured and monitored, and every response from the AI could incept an ideology in your mind. In fact, when you think about it, that’s what information does. It plants seeds in your mind.</p><p>This is why you need a diverse set of ideas in the minds of men! You want a flourishing rainforest in your mind, not some mono-crop field of wheat, with deteriorated soil, that is susceptible to weather and insects, and completely dependent on Monsanto (or Open AI or Pfizer) for its survival. You want your mind to flourish and for that <em>you need idea-versity</em><em>.</em></p><p>This was the promise of the internet. A place where anyone can say anything. The internet has been a force for good, but it is under attack. Whether that’s been the de-anonymization of social profiles like those on Twitter and Facebook, and the creeping KYC across all sorts of online platforms, through to the algorithmic vomit that is spewed forth from the platforms themselves. We tasted that in <em>all</em> its glory from 2020. And it seems to be only getting worse.</p><p>The push by WEF-like organizations to institute KYC for online identities, and tie it to a CBDC and your iris is one alternative, but it’s a bit overt and explicit. After the pushback on medical experimentation of late, such a move may be harder to pull off. An easier move could be to allow LUIs to take over (as they will, because they’re a superior user experience) and in the meantime create an “AI safety council” that will institute “safety” filters on all major large language models (LLMs).</p><p>Don’t believe me? <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/g7-leaders-confirm-need-governance-generative-ai-technology-2023-05-19/">Our G7 overlords are discussing it already</a>.</p><p>Today, the web is still made up of webpages, and if you’re curious enough, you can find the deep, dark corners and crevices of dissidence. You can still surf the web. Mostly. But when everything becomes accessible only through these models, you’re not surfing anything anymore. You’re simply being given a synthesis of a response that has been run through all the necessary filters and censors. </p><p>There will probably be a sprinkle of truth somewhere in there, but it will be wrapped up in so much “safety” that 99.9% of people won’t hear or know of it. The truth will become that which the model says it is.</p><p>I’m not sure what happens to much of the internet when discoverability of information fundamentally transforms. I can imagine that, as most applications transition to some form of language interface, it’s going to be very hard to find things that the “portal” you’re using doesn’t deem safe or approved.</p><p>One could, of course, make the argument that in the same way you need the tenacity and curiosity to find the dissident crevices on the web, you’ll need to learn to prompt and hack your way into better answers on these platforms. </p><p>And that may be true, but it seems to me that for each time you find something “unsafe,” the route shall be patched or blocked.</p><p>You could then argue that “this could backfire on them, by diminishing the utility of the tool.” </p><p>And once again, I would probably agree. In a free market, such stupidity would make way for better tools.</p><p>But of course, the free market is becoming a thing of the past. What we are seeing with these hysterical attempts to push for “safety” is that they are either knowingly or unknowingly paving the way for squashing possible alternatives.</p><p>In creating “safety” committees that “regulate” these platforms (read: regulate speech), new models that are not run through such “safety or toxicity filters” will not be available for consumer usage, or they may be made illegal, or hard to discover. How many people still use Tor? Or DuckDuckGo?</p><p>And if you think this isn’t happening, <a href="https://medium.com/jigsaw/reducing-toxicity-in-large-language-models-with-perspective-api-c31c39b7a4d7">here’s</a> some information on the current toxicity filters that most LLMs already plug into. It’s only a matter of time before such filters become like KYC mandates on financial applications. A new compliance appendage, strapped onto language models like tits on a bull.</p><p>Whatever the counter-argument to this homogenization attempt, both actually support my point that we need to build alternatives, and we need to begin that process now.</p><p>For those who still tend to believe that AGI is around the corner and that LLMs are a significant step in that direction, by all means, you’re free to believe what you want, but that doesn’t negate the point of this essay.</p><p>If language is the new “screen” and all the language we see or hear must be run through approved filters, the information we consume, the way we learn, the very thoughts we have, will all be narrowed into a very small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a>.</p><p>I think that’s a massive risk for humanity.</p><p>We’ve become dumb enough with social media algorithms serving us what the platforms think we should know. And when they wanted to turn on the hysteria, it was easy. Language user interfaces are social media times 100.</p><p>Imagine what they can do with that, the next time a so-called “crisis” hits?</p><p>It won’t be pretty.</p><p>The marketplace of ideas is necessary to a healthy and functional society. That’s what I want.</p><p>Their narrowing of thought won’t work long term, because it’s anti-life. In the end, it will fail, just like every other attempt to bottle up truth and ignore it. But each attempt comes with unnecessary damage, pain, loss and catastrophe. That’s what I am trying to avoid and help ring the bell for.</p><h2>What To Do About All This?</h2><p>If we’re not proactive here, this whole AI revolution could become the “great homogenization.” To avoid that, we have to do <em>two</em> main things: </p><ol><li>Push back against the “AI safety” narratives: These might look like safety committees on the surface, but when you dig a little deeper, you realize they are speech and thought regulators.</li><li>Build alternatives, now: Build many and open source them. The sooner we do this, and the sooner they can run more locally, the better chance we have to avoid a world in which everything trends toward homogenization.</li></ol><p>If we do this, we can have a world with real diversity — not the woke kind of bullshit. I mean diversity of thought, diversity of ideas, diversity of viewpoints and a true marketplace of ideas.</p><p><em>An idea-versity.</em> What the original promise of the internet was. And not bound by the low bandwidth of typing and tapping. Couple that with Bitcoin, the internet of money, and you have the ingredients for a bright new future.</p><p>This is what the team and I are doing at Laier Two Labs. We’re building smaller, narrow models that people can use as substitutes to these large language models.</p><p>We are going to open source all our models, and in time, aim to have them be compact enough to run locally on your own machines, while retaining a degree of depth, character and unique bias for use when and where you need it most.</p><p>We will announce our first model in the coming weeks. The goal is to make it the go-to model for a topic and industry I hold very dear to my heart: Bitcoin. I also believe it’s here that we must start to build a suite of alternative AI models and tools.</p><p>I will unveil it on the next blog.

Kennedy Jr., took to Twitter to express his support for Bitcoin. <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1654304979207815174?s=20">In a tweet</a>, he stated that “Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for people’s movements around the world, particularly in Burma.”</p><p>Myanmar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar">also known as Burma</a>, is a country located in Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Thailand, Laos and Bangladesh. The country has stunning natural beauty, including untouched beaches, vast forests and a rich culture of Buddhism. Despite these attractions, Myanmar has <a href="https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/capstones/2603/">been tortured by the world's longest civil war</a>, which has been ongoing for more than 70 years, since it achieved <a href="https://asiangeo.com/articles/the-road-to-independence-burma-1945-1962/">independence in 1945</a>. The country has also experienced multiple military coups throughout its history, leading to political instability and economic turmoil. Additionally, the <a href="https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/religion-context/country-profiles/myanmar/economic-policies-and-ideologies">government has a history of demonetizing the local currency</a>, and there have been frequent banking crises. </p><p>One of Myanmar's most notable instances of demonetization occurred in 1987, leading to the historic "8888 Uprising." On September 5, 1987, the military dictator Ne Win <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-09-12-mn-1980-story.html">announced the demonetization of Myanmar's 25, 35, and 75 kyat notes</a> without providing prior notice or replacing them for citizens. At that time, these notes accounted for <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/on-this-day/day-three-myanmar-banknotes-suddenly-became-worthless.html">80% of the circulation in the economy</a>. Previous demonetization efforts in 1964 and 1985 <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/on-this-day/day-three-myanmar-banknotes-suddenly-became-worthless.html">had compensated noteholders</a>, making this move in 1987 especially unexpected and devastating for the people of Myanmar. The choice to demonetize these particular, odd denominations sparked significant speculation, as they were believed to hold special status. It is widely held that Ne Win, who was highly superstitious, considered these numbers to be propitious both for the country and himself on a personal level. </p><p>Myanmar's transformation era commenced with the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-obama-myanmar/obama-offers-praise-pressure-on-historic-myanmar-trip-idUSBRE8AI04320121119">visit of U.S. President Barack Obama to the country in 2012</a>, followed by its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/asia/myanmar-elections/index.html">first civilian election in 2015</a>, which marked a significant milestone in the country's path toward democracy. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">2021 Myanmar military coup</a> has set the country back by a decade. The military's seizure of power in February 2021 has sparked widespread protests and violence across the country, with thousands of people taking to the streets to demand the release of detained political leaders, including the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/1/timeline-two-years-since-the-myanmar-military-coup">State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint</a> and the restoration of democracy.</p><p>But following the military coup in February 2021, the military has brutally cracked down on civilians who are protesting against the regime. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57380237">Reports indicate</a> that the military has resorted to extreme measures to suppress dissent, including shooting protesters on the spot and arresting individuals, some of whom have been found dead the following day. The military junta has also taken steps to silence activists and journalists who have spoken out against the coup on social media by <a href="https://coconuts.co/yangon/news/myanmar-bank-faces-boycott-after-freezing-accounts-to-block-donations-to-anti-coup-forces/">freezing their bank accounts</a>, making it difficult for them to access their funds and personal savings. These actions have led to widespread condemnation from the international community and have raised concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in Myanmar.</p><p>A source from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ANTSforPeople">ANTS</a>, a group that raises funds for the democracy movement in Myanmar, revealed to me that many of their members and their friends had their bank accounts frozen by the military regime since they started fundraising efforts in October 2021. These efforts have also led to the arrests and questioning of the family members of activists. In response to the situation, a 22-year-old activist from ANTS told me, "To overcome getting their bank accounts frozen, ANTS changed its fundraising strategy to take bank information privately and instruct donors to write online shopping payment in the note section to reduce the risk of exposure." </p><p>Assisting resistance groups in Myanmar poses a significant danger for individuals irrespective of social hierarchy. Even a donation of less than $10 to these groups <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/prison-terms-04062022170714.html">has led to ten years of prison sentences for some individuals</a>. In one instance, a well-known jeweler in the Mandalay region was arrested for allegedly supporting the resistance, resulting in the seizure of his assets, including properties, businesses and an <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-gems-boss-arrested-for-alleged-resistance-support.html">astounding 193 tons of raw jade</a> valued at approximately 12 billion kyat (equivalent to roughly $5.7 million).</p><h2>Alternatives, But Not Solutions</h2><p>Furthermore, the group revealed that they have explored alternative digital payment options such as <a href="https://nugpay.app/">NUGPay</a>, a pilot digital currency platform launched by Myanmar's parallel government, the <a href="https://www.nugmyanmar.org/en/">National Unity Government </a>(NUG). However, as one of their members explained, "Our donors are hesitant to use the platform because it requires opening a bank account with an agent who is either inside Myanmar or outside of Myanmar. Who can guarantee that it is purely safe for the agent and users in terms of data security? It looks like having a double risk than using the traditional banking system.”</p><p>But NUGPay, a digital currency platform built on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_(payment_network)#:~:text=Stellar%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource,communicate%20with%20other%20Stellar%20servers.">open-source Stellar network</a>, has faced concerns over data security from many people. </p><p>As of May 28, 2023, the <a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/DMMK-GDMMKKNI5KTQWFEI57ZTCAPFUJFGQSW5YUN5AJ4O2I25JXEU3IL2DZXD-1?filter=payments">Stellar blockchain had recorded 26,950 trustlines using the platform</a>. However, the mobile app Exxon Film Investment — which allegedly enticed users with interest-yield incentives — had <a href="https://www.mizzimaburmese.com/article/126642">managed to scam more than 30,000 people in Myanmar</a>, creating a number of users who are now discouraged from exploring digital currencies like Bitcoin that exceeds the entire user base of NUGPay, highlighting the challenges of ensuring the security of digital financial transactions in Myanmar.</p><p>"I think from my experience, many local young people still do not believe in the potential of digital currency,” Feliz, the founder of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/myancryptocurrency">Myan Crypto</a>, a local crypto educational community, told me. “It is still skeptical in our community. Not to mention senior citizens."</p><p>He added, "Many people in our community came to the Bitcoin and crypto trading industry because they are kind of rich in cash but they don’t know what to do in this economic fallout."</p><p>Regarding NUGPay, Feliz expressed concerns about its limited adoption, saying, "I think the problem of NUGPay is limited adoption. You can’t use it as a currency outside of the revolution group. I think it needs widespread adoption everywhere to make it as an effective currency. Even some people who trade bitcoin and crypto don’t use or hesitate to use the NUGPay due to its limited acceptance.

Prior to the coup, the price of 1 BTC was approximately 500 million kyat, but it is hovering around 1 billion kyat on <a href="https://p2p.binance.com/en/trade/all-payments/BTC?fiat=MMK">Binance’s peer-to-peer exchange</a> as of this writing. </p><p>"We believe that the adoption of bitcoin and other digital currencies in Myanmar will be a gradual process, given the current economic environment and the fragile risk tolerance of the majority of people," a representative of the Bitcoin Myanmar Initiative told me. "However, we see the potential for growth due to the country's previous experiences with technology leapfrogging. With a smartphone penetration rate of 78% and only 36% of the population having a bank account, many people in Myanmar are looking for an alternative to traditional banking. By promoting a form of currency that no one can control, we aim to help people reclaim their property rights in a digital way and unleash themselves from the military regime's monetary policy. We believe that it's just a matter of time before more people in Myanmar recognize the benefits of Bitcoin."</p><p>Highlighting another powerful example of how Bitcoin can help those in Myanmar in “<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/check-your-financial-privilege">Check Your Financial Privilege</a>,” author Alex Gladstein wrote that:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“As a personal example, someone reached out to me at the beginning of the Myanmar revolution in February 2021. They wanted to provide aid to the democracy movement, but the banking system was practically shuttered, and there was no easy way to wire dollars. After doing some digging, we were introduced to an aid worker-turned-activist who was also a Bitcoin user. He could easily accept a donation, save it in BTC, and then sell it on the peer-to-peer markets when he needed to spend the collapsing local kyat currency on goods. An address was sent over Signal, and a gift was made in minutes. No barriers, no middlemen, and no possibility for corruption along the way. It is just one small example, but it is a glimpse of what the future could hold.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><em>This is a guest post by Win Ko Ko Aung.

Jor Law, Prime Trust's Interim CEO and President, said he believes that the combination of Prime Trust and BitGo will be a game-changer for the industry, stating, "No other company will have the breadth of product and services nor depth of experience that this combined company would have. We are excited to offer our world-class infrastructure within a broader ecosystem and revolutionize the future of crypto."</p><p>The blog posting listed the benefits the acquisition could hold for both companies. First, it noted that Prime Trust's Nevada Trust Company will join BitGo's global network of regulated trust companies, which already includes entities in South Dakota, New York, Germany and Switzerland. In addition, the expansion would enhance BitGo's presence and regulatory reach. Furthermore, the blog described how Prime Trust's fintech API infrastructure and exchange network will reinforce BitGo's existing services, including custody, liquidity, settlement and compliance capabilities.</p><p>Mike Belshe, CEO and Co-Founder of BitGo, views the acquisition as a milestone transaction that will contribute to a more secure and sustainable future for the digital asset landscape. Belshe stated, "With the expected acquisition of Prime Trust, BitGo is well positioned to enhance its best-in-class, trusted solutions and to service the combined customer base."</p><p>The deal is still subject to regulatory approval, and further details regarding the transaction are yet to be disclosed.</p><p>Just recently, bitcoin-only exchanges <a href="https://twitter.com/brianleejackson/status/1666583718256054272?s=20">Strike</a> and <a href="https://help.swanbitcoin.com/hc/en-us/articles/14874253038743">Swan</a> both announced that they would be moving away from custody through Prime Trust. Strike announced that it will be utilizing its own custody services, while Swan is moving to Fortress Trust and BitGo, Fortress Trust being founded by the former founder of Prime Trust, Scott Purcell. The acquisition announcement did not address or confirm rumors that Prime Trust is facing insolvency, which has been the center of speculation on Bitcoin Twitter.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[SatoshiLabs Introduces Vexl Foundation With KYC-Free P2P Bitcoin App And Financial Tyranny Index]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Foundation, supported by the company behind Trezor Wallet, is supposed to be an embodiment of the ideals of Bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index</guid><category><![CDATA[Vexl Foundation]]></category><category><![CDATA[KYC]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[app]]></category><category><![CDATA[P2P]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[peer to peer]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 18:43:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNTM3MTYyODg3OTk2OTY0/individual-challenge-climb-peak-flag-mountain-top-photo.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=SatoshiLabs&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">SatoshiLabs</a>, the creator of the Trezor hardware wallet, has announced the launch of the Vexl Foundation at the BTC Prague conference.

    </figure><p>What if I told you that the largest pension fund in the United States could be rescued by Bitcoin? Furthermore, what if it could happen in a way that maintains 100% of its primary portfolio investments in traditional markets? I know. For those who don’t “Bitcoin,” many of you will stop here. But I urge you to read on a bit further. And for those who do Bitcoin, there is likely a pension near you facing a similar dilemma.</p><p>By incorporating bitcoin into the <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">California Employers Pension Prefunding Trust Fund</a> (CEPPT), California could continue to deliver on its commitment to its workforce and retirees, without having to make employees work longer years while paying more into the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/">CalPERS</a>) fund. Additionally, if California doesn’t want to do this, municipalities could and should do it on their own regardless by funding what I call a “Bitcoin Municipal Employers Pension Prefunding Trust (MEPPT).” In doing so, cities and public agencies could escape the redundant fate of unfunded liability payments.</p><p>Why bitcoin? Unlike other assets, “Bitcoin has no risk of liquidation,” as explained by Mickey Koss in a recent article, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/pension-funds-must-adopt-bitcoin">“Pension Funds Must Adopt Bitcoin or Risk Insolvency.”</a> “Bitcoin does not require leverage. Instead of making risky bets, perpetuating the culture of moral hazard and socialized losses, pension funds can use bitcoin as an asymmetric opportunity in order to bolster their returns.”</p><h2>The CalPERS Crisis</h2><p>With a total value of roughly $440 billion dollars, CalPERS is the largest “defined benefit” public pension in the nation, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1314998/public-pension-funds-worldwide-based-on-assets-under-management/#:~:text=Leading%20global%20public%20pension%20funds%202022%2C%20by%20assets%20under%20management&amp;text=Japan's%20Government%20Pension%20Investment%20Fund,worth%201.32%20trillion%20U.S.%20dollars.">fifth-largest public pension in the world</a> as of 2022. Holding in its hands the financial fates of public employees, municipalities and public agencies in California, CalPERS’ main priority is to grow and maintain its fund. By doing so, it can deliver on its commitments, which are payments to retirees.</p><p>The funded status of any pension takes the form of a percentage. It is the total estimated value of the assets on hand as a percentage of the total obligation to pay retirees (its liabilities). As reported most recently in June 2022, <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/board-agendas/202211/financeadmin/item-6a-01_a.pdf">CalPERS holds an estimated funded status of 72%</a>. This is below the traditionally accepted “healthy” funded status <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundedstatus.asp">which is at least 80%</a>. Most simply, this means that the fund currently has the ability to liquidate its assets to obtain 72% of the funds needed to make all of its payments. Thus, 28% of its overall liabilities are unfunded.</p><p>California has a larger unfunded pension liability than any other state in the nation. A report released earlier last year by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), found that unfunded pension liabilities nationwide have <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/california/article_b77e67bc-e842-11ec-ba2b-83e39b9717cd.html">climbed to $8.28 trillion</a>, “or just under $25,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States,” with California holding the nation’s largest public pension debt load.</p><p>CalPERS’ unfunded pension liability comes on the tail end of <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/about/laws-legislation-regulations/public-employees-pension-reform-act">major pension reform in 2013</a>. The reform extended the retirement age of new employees and increased employee contributions into the fund. Additionally, the fund benefited from a massive injection of liquidity in the past few years. </p><p>Governor Newsom’s 2022 to 2023 “<a href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/2022-23/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf">Governor's Budget Summary</a>” noted that “from 2017-18 through 2021-22, the state has made supplemental pension payments of $12.7 billion to CalPERS and CalSTRS (the California State Teachers Retirement System), with the goal of improving the funded status of both systems and reducing the state’s long-term retirement obligations.”</p><p>Despite both of these efforts over the past decade, a sustained improvement in CalPERS’ funded status has not arrived. On the eve of the next reporting period, all eyes are on the funded status and unfunded liability report that should arrive in June 2023. Fingers crossed.</p><h2>Unfunded Liabilities And Their Impacts</h2><p>An unfunded liability, quite simply, is the amount owed to keep a pension fund on pace to meet its obligations. Unfunded liabilities lead to extra payments, on top of the regular, annually-required payments to the pension, made by municipalities and public agencies. If you are scratching your head at this point, that’s normal. Pensions are complex with tons of variables, including the number of active employees/retirees, predicted life expectancy of retirees, cost-of-living adjustments, portfolio performance and more.</p><p>Unfunded liabilities don’t just disappear. They force CalPERS to request additional payments from municipalities and public agencies, on top of the normal payments made by those cities and agencies, as well as the contributions made by the employees into the pension fund.</p><p>These “extra” payments take a significant toll on cities. If unpaid, they accrue interest, and become looming burdens. I learned this after sitting on the pension advisory committee in my own city — a city with a long tradition of having an incredible public workforce. High-quality employees are so important. While this view is widely accepted in the private sector, it isn’t always so in the public sector. But some of the best-run and highest-revenue-earning cities understand and prioritize this. A dedicated public workforce is a tremendous benefit for the citizens of a city and visitors who receive city services. In the field of emergency services, that level of service can be the difference between life and death.</p><p>When municipalities have to pay unfunded liabilities on top of their normal pension payments, they either have to be extremely well off, or take away services from somewhere else to make the payments. </p><p>But luckily, we have an opportunity to escape this dilemma.</p><h2>How Bitcoin Can Fill The Unfunded Gap</h2><p>Enter Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an innovation with increasing global adoption, use and value. While the price has fluctuated greatly since its inception, Bitcoin’s network and community trajectory has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/btc-adoption-vs-internet-kevin-maraj?trk=articles_directory">outpaced many comparable technological revolutions in their early years</a>. That includes the internet, cell phones and other major technological breakthroughs. Additionally, as an asset, when zooming out, its performance trends up.</p><p>Despite its upward trajectory, Bitcoin is still new and, therefore, turbulent and constantly adapting. It also has yet to be clearly defined by the legacy financial system and regulatory agencies, providing barriers to entry.</p><p>CalPERS could add bitcoin to its balance sheets. But an easier, more realistic course of action would be to utilize a tool it already created: the CEPPT. </p><p>The CEPPT is a separate, “<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">Section 115 trust fund dedicated to prefunding employer contributions to defined benefit pension systems for eligible California public agencies</a>.” Think of it as a side fund to cover the shortfalls of the main fund. The flaw with the current, non-Bitcoin CEPPT, is that the fund is based in the same system that brought about the need for a new side fund to begin with. Eventually, that fund will succumb to the same structural vulnerabilities as the CalPERS main pension portfolio. And then what? A pre-, pre-funding trust to pay the pre-funding trust?</p><p>CalPERS’ <a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/ceppt">CEPPT webpage</a> says that, since its inception, “more than 75 California public employers” are participating. My recommendation: Pivot, or if you are an elected city official, reconsider this strategy. Instead, establish a Bitcoin MEPPT. </p><p>The long-term returns of bitcoin represent the only asset class that can fill the holes, currently un-fillable, in the CalPERS pension fund. The cities that implement this will find themselves the beneficiaries of a healthy workforce and financial stability. They will bypass the painful dilemma of cutting key services to taxpayers in order to pay endless unfunded liabilities. They can avoid downgrading their workforce to the point that they are unable to recruit and retain high-quality personnel.</p><h2>Bitcoin CEPPT Or MEPPT: Easy First Step And Added Benefits</h2><p>With a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT, public employers, cities, employees and CalPERS can safely enter the world of Bitcoin without moving funds out of its portfolio, which we know is very difficult.</p><p>A Bitcoin CEPPT run by the state could free California from its value-based investment dichotomy. That dichotomy: being a state that simultaneously funds and prioritizes renewable energy, while condemning <em>yet</em> financially supporting fossil fuels and big oil through its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobeccles/2023/02/01/california-dreamin-calpers-and-calstrs-caught-in-climate-crossfire/?sh=1a93c1492b1c">roughly $42 billion</a> investment. The largest public fund investor of fossil fuels in the U.S. is CalPERS. It truly has one foot into the future while propping up the past.</p><p>A Bitcoin CEPPT could also include infrastructure components. A potential structure could allow California to further tap its <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CA">abundant and steady renewable energy</a>, providing Bitcoin miners an opportunity to become even more climate friendly than they already are. In fact, a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-uses-mostly-sustainable-energy">majority of Bitcoin mining captures either wasted energy sources or renewable energy</a>. Bitcoin miners that have proven useful as a grid-balancing partner, could take the place of household energy consumers in California during times when the power is often shut off, such as during its frequent <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/lmk/pdf/what_is_a_red_flag_warning.pdf">red-flag warning, fire-weather days</a>. During these times, Southern California Edison is <a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/outage-information/psps">forced to balance the grid and shut off power to peoples’ homes</a>. </p><p>In these ways, and many more unmentioned ones, Bitcoin is a far better partner for <a href="https://batcoinz.com/BEEST/">California’s renewable energy goals</a>, then the big oil and fossil fuel Industry, currently capturing $42 billion, nearly 10% of CalPERS invested money!</p><p>For other states with similar issues, there are many exciting ways in which a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT could be configured. There is even a tool called “<a href="https://nakamotoportfolio.com/">Nakamoto Portfolio</a>,” which was developed by Raphael Zagury, the CIO of Swan Financial. This tool allows funds to explore different configurations of how bitcoin could positively affect their portfolios based on past and predicted performances.</p><p>Despite its volatility, many legacy financial institutions predict the long-term value of bitcoin will continue to rise. Fidelity has even called for 1 Bitcoin to be valued at <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-worth-1-billion-2038-fidelity/">$1 million dollars by 2038</a>. That’s conservative, among some other long-term predictions. Many have compared Bitcoin to Apple, however it is much more than Apple. Apple changed the way in which the world interacts with technology. Bitcoin is simply going to change the world, and for the better and in ways we have yet to imagine.</p><p>In the likely event that Bitcoin is here to stay, this is a vehicle in which CalPERS can responsibly and slowly enter into the world of Bitcoin. Who knows, perhaps a Bitcoin CEPPT could prove worthy of primary portfolio contributions, to a point where it takes on a greater portion of CalPERS funds? </p><p>I’d like to see both ride off together into the California sunset: The CalPERS fund and Bitcoin CEPPT, giving California options to invest in ways truer to its core values, while supporting a vibrant and committed workforce.</p><p>To the cities and agencies who scoff at the idea of a Bitcoin CEPPT or MEPPT, I ask you an important question: If not Bitcoin, then what’s the plan to avoid bankruptcy or a declining workforce in your city due to runaway unfunded liabilities? To the unions and workers, how much longer are you willing to work and for how much less money, until we become more involved in the oversight of our own pension funds? And to CalPERS and the California legislature, you have a fiduciary obligation to those workers who built our state, to protect their funds and futures. Without another plan, cities, public employers and states owe it to the taxpayers and employees to explore Bitcoin and its promising future.</p><p>I am eager and happy to work with any union, city or elected official in the state to explore this as an option, at no cost. Why? Because I care about workers. As a firefighter and union leader, I’ve worked alongside a committed and amazing workforce, and I believe that when humans commit their most precious years to building something for their cities and states, they deserve the retirement that was promised on signup day.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dom Bei.

This is the second <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-winter-6504445">“crypto winter</a>” for my company, which produces Bitcoin mining containers.</p><p>In this article, I will share the story of how our Bitcoin mining company survived its first crypto winter, and is now surviving its second (as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932023_global_energy_crisis">world’s ongoing energy crisis</a>), and what we think will happen with the energy and crypto mining industries in the future.</p><h2>Our First Crypto Winter</h2><p><a href="https://ezblockchain.net/cases/">Our company</a> was launched in the first quarter of 2017 as a data center hosting solution with a mission to bring the best technology to Bitcoin miners.</p><p>We suffered a knock-on effect and initiated widespread redundancies as we struggled amid the looming cryptocurrency crash of the time. But we were still young, so our company had little to lose. We had only five employees and we had to learn to survive, mainly by managing cost and operating in a lean and mean way.</p><h2>Surviving Our Second Crypto Winter</h2><p>We arrived at the second crypto winter as one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining container producers (producing 10 containers every week). We have been one of the pioneers in utilizing wasted flared gas energy for Bitcoin mining and had built 10 cryptocurrency mining facilities across eight states and Canada, operating with more than 200 megawatts (MWs) of power. </p><p>But 2022 was among the most challenging years for us and the entire Bitcoin mining industry. It was characterized by declining bitcoin prices and rising energy costs, influenced by the energy crisis provoked by the war in Ukraine. Many mining <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-could-set-price-bottom">companies declared bankruptcy</a>, and those that survived had to reconsider their operations.</p><p>Some companies managed to survive in a year-long crypto winter, one that is arguably not over yet, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/record-bitcoin-mining-despite-bear-market">record mining difficulty</a> and completely-frozen funding. From my six years of experience running a Bitcoin infrastructure company, there are a few solutions I can share that I hope will help others or offer insight into how resilient Bitcoin mining can be. This should not be considered a panacea for market downturns or managerial advice, but simply what I have learned for myself. </p><h2>First, We Called Our Power Providers </h2><p>The bull run over the last few years has shown that Bitcoin miners prioritize acquiring miners over securing relationships with utilities.</p><p>But we believe that prioritizing the securing of power, and all of the infrastructure behind it, is critical. Last year, the bankruptcies of mining companies taught us just that. Having open communications with power providers on realistic expectations always helps sketch a clear plan for getting power flowing safely and on time. </p><p>There are multiple reasons why utilities are incentivized to sell power to Bitcoin mining companies: First, they make a profit on every kilowatt-hour (kWh) sold. However, giving more incentives to the electricity supplier, such as load flexibility, the high-capacity factor and controlled load increase, helps build a stronger foundation among integral partners in the Bitcoin mining industry. From my experience, power providers do not see Bitcoin miners any differently than other electricity consumers, as long as the bills are paid on time. </p><p>When the energy crisis hit us, the first thing we did was to call our power company partners and tell them that all the bills would be paid. We started to run the extra mile, investing in relationships with them.</p><h2>Take A Hands-On Approach To Construction</h2><p>We all know that electricity bills often take up more than 90% of mining expenditures. However, the seed for a successful Bitcoin mining operation site is planted with the first conduit in the ground, even before the machines start buzzing. </p><p>Developing a Bitcoin mining farm is a tedious job, requiring many moving pieces to come together. Usually, we are so focused on the bitcoin price and mining difficulty that not enough time is spent on the design, site planning and construction of a well-run facility. This fundamental job is usually outsourced to a consulting firm, an engineering firm or someone else. </p><p>But the negligence in hands-on planning of an operation during the construction and development stage can cost a fortune going forward. Even the most professional construction firm most likely has yet to gain experience in building a Bitcoin mining farm. It must be guided by Bitcoin nerds who know about common power supply problems like ASIC overheating issues, firmware upgrades, etc. </p><p>We’ve learned that a well-built Bitcoin facility reduces operational, cooling, maintenance and uptime expenses for years. On the other hand, a poorly-designed site can lead to rebuilding a plane in the air. The worst nightmare can be when everything is set, and you realize that something crucial is wrong. It could be that the voltage on a transformer is incorrect, or the cable is not sized correctly to operate 24/7, 365 with a nearly-95% load factor, just to name a few potential issues. </p><p>Learning about transformers, substations and airflow during development helps avoid future mistakes. This type of involvement is more crucial than constantly negotiating the price of mining equipment online. From a simple business perspective, the depreciation rate on a mining farm project is more than a decade, relatively small compared to that of mining equipment which is only a couple of years. That is why we let the mining infrastructure sit and wait for ASICs. </p><p>Bitcoin mining operations are marathons, not sprints. They require hard work behind the scenes before the hash rate shows up in the pool. Therefore, when the second crypto winter hit us, our key company players rolled up their sleeves and put their best feet forward to ensure the business operations were set up for success. </p><h2>Think Creatively About Energy Consumption</h2><h3>Gas Flaring Mitigation </h3><p>As power demands and electricity costs continue to rise, miners must integrate their power generation vertically. They must find new ways to generate revenue that do not only depend on hash price. </p><p>In 2018, when the bitcoin price started to fall, we were looking for alternative and affordable power to stay afloat. The obvious idea was that to get the most affordable power, one needs to generate electricity to eliminate intermediaries. We then realized that there was no way we could generate hydro, wind or solar power with a limited budget. </p><p>However, gas and electric generation has been around for decades and is relatively simple. What about natural gas? We would not have to buy propane tanks to mine Bitcoin. There was no need when <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/report-oil-companies-are-burning-off-natural-gas-and-leaving-regulators-in-the-dark/">billions of cubic feet of natural gas are burned annually in oil fields</a>. While drilling for oil, natural gas is released from the same reservoir. Sadly, the gas is flared due to a lack of infrastructure or economic feasibility in capturing it. That’s when I first realized that Bitcoin mining could be a tool that supplements the inefficiencies of the energy industry. Since then, we started <a href="https://ezblockchain.net/smartgrid/">mining Bitcoin on natural gas</a>.</p><h3>Flexible Loads </h3><p>The energy sector is transitioning from a fossil-fuels-dominated era to one of renewable power. Specifically, wind and solar are intermittent, adding stress to the grid. Our solution to inconsistent supply has been mixing renewable energy with natural gas-peaking power plants. These power plants are flexible enough to fire up the turbines within a few minutes’ notice to respond to the undersupply. </p><p>Those operations that are heavily dependent on renewables power grids need to implement a demand-response program where the grid incentivizes the users to reduce the load. This has become a game changer in power grid operation. By lowering the peak demand for energy, demand response programs reduce the need to construct new, expensive peaking generation units. However, since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/FERC_NAPDR_-_final.pdf">National Action Plan On Demand Response</a> in 2010, more progress has yet to be achieved.</p><p>A decade since, Bitcoin mining is the game changer. It is the most flexible, efficient, financially-feasible and, most importantly, working solution to grid instability. It can dispatch enormous loads of power in minutes without requiring any subsidies. It is market driven because Bitcoin miners always search for lower-cost operating facilities. Interestingly, the demand-response industry attracted a lot of attention once it started working correctly at scale. But the hero happened to be a long-hated “villain”: Bitcoin. </p><h2>The Future </h2><p>Energy companies have worked with Bitcoin miners long enough to understand that this industry is here to stay. It is a matter of time until the entire energy industry grows enough hard skin to accept it. Bitcoin mining has flipped from being just a power consumer to a consumer with benefits. The mining companies that will adopt different mining strategies, including optimizing operational costs, partnering with energy providers and finding a way to earn additional revenues using Bitcoin mining as a tool for energy management, will prevail. </p><p>This halving cycle ending in less than a year means that electricity sourcing and power prices will be even more crucial for the long-term success of the Bitcoin mining community. The next era of mining winners will be technologically-adapted companies with versatile toolkits to manage crises on many levels, including technological solutions for updating existing and developing new solutions. </p><p>Winters will come and go, Bitcoin will stay. The question is, who remains along with it?</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Sergii Gerasymovych.

The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102">SEC also accused</a> Coinbase of failing to register its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. The complaint alleges that since 2019, Coinbase has facilitated the buying and selling of billions of dollars' worth of crypto asset securities without proper registration, combining the functions of an exchange, broker, and clearing agency.</p><p>The SEC claims that Coinbase's failure to register has deprived investors of essential protections such as SEC inspection, recordkeeping requirements, and safeguards against conflicts of interest. The charges also extend to Coinbase's holding company, Coinbase Global Inc., as it is considered a control person and thus liable for some of Coinbase's violations.</p><p>Additionally, the SEC alleges that Coinbase conducted an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program. This program allows customers to earn profits through blockchain transaction validation services. Coinbase allegedly pooled customers' stakeable crypto assets, performed the necessary validations, and rewarded customers with a portion of the generated rewards. The SEC states that Coinbase failed to register these offers and sales as required by law.</p><p>Just yesterday, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sec-sues-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-alleging-securities-laws-violations">SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance</a> and its CEO CZ, alleging that the exchange violated securities laws, brazenly dodged regulation by the SEC and did not properly inform their consumers. The combination of lawsuits within two days indicate a major effort by U.S. regulators to set a new tone for regulation and application of securities law to digital assets.</p><p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1666059466750541825?s=20">criticized</a> Coinbase's alleged deprivation of critical protections for investors. Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, accused Coinbase of deliberately refusing to follow the federal securities laws, noting that the consequences for the investing public are significant.</p><p>Like the SEC's complaint against Binance, the regulator seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, penalties and other equitable relief. The investigation was conducted by the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, with the assistance of the San Francisco Regional Office and the multi-state task force of ten state securities regulators.</p><p>Coinbase has not yet responded publicly to the charges. The outcome of this case will have significant implications for the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States and could be a major shift for the growth of the industry in the country. It's important to note that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/28/secs-gensler-reiterates-bitcoin-alone-is-a-commodity-is-he-right/">SEC Chair Gary Gensler is on record</a> as differentiating Bitcoin from cryptocurrencies at large, saying that bitcoin alone is a commodity.

According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, LINER serves as a benchmark interest rate for bitcoin without credit risk, similar to the traditional finance's LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). The index aims to provide an alternative to enterprises seeking exposure to bitcoin while avoiding the credit risk associated with CeFi yield platforms.</p><p>"By communicating real yield rates from bitcoin held on the LN, enterprises will recognize the strategic error in trusting CeFi yield platforms while capturing the benefits of payment network disruption that is decades overdue,” said Jesse Shrader, co-founder and CEO of Amboss. Nik Bhatia, creator of <a href="https://thebitcoinlayer.substack.com/">The Bitcoin Layer</a>, praised LINER as a first-of-its-kind reference rate derived from the Lightning Network, contributing to the establishment of unmanipulated money markets independent of a central authority.</p><p>Allen Farrington, a Bitcoin writer and investor, acknowledged the value of a reference rate like LINER for assessing the true cost of capital, highlighting the Lightning Network's growth as a self-sustaining financial ecosystem for both retail and enterprise needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Amboss also operates <a href="https://amboss.space/magma">Magma</a>, a marketplace facilitating the buying and selling of Lightning channels, enabling bitcoin holders to earn BTC from opening Lightning channels to various destinations. “Since Lightning channels are self-custodial ways to hold bitcoin, Magma enables novel bitcoin yield without custodial risk, avoiding the pitfalls of failed CeFi yield platforms like Celsius and BlockFi,” the press release stated.</p><p>LINER comprises two insightful metrics: LINER Cost and LINER Yield, which provide enterprises with valuable insights into the lightning market. These metrics allow for comparisons between LINER Cost and traditional payment card fees, empowering large bitcoin holders to make informed decisions regarding their bitcoin holdings.</p><p>Jonathan Bier, an author and investor, noted the potential future significance of the LINER index as a reference rate for Bitcoin-based investment decisions. The introduction of LINER opens up possibilities for portfolio managers, investors and businesses to leverage the index in their decision-making processes.</p><p>With LINER, Amboss aims to encourage enterprise adoption of the Lightning Network by demonstrating the cost savings and low-risk yield potential offered by Lightning-enabled payment infrastructure. The index provides a clear incentive for large bitcoin holders to utilize self-custodial strategies and earn higher returns while minimizing risk.

The penetration rate of digital payments among general consumers is also growing, as a McKinsey<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/consumer-trends-in-digital-payments"> survey</a> from 2022 found that nearly 90% of U.S. residents are using some form of digital payments.</p><p>And the Bitcoin market in particular is gaining greater attention, as the recent U.S. banking crisis and the negative outlook of the global economy <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/on-the-bitcoin-price-in-banking-crisis">serve to drive more individuals and businesses toward this sector</a>. Bitcoin is seen by many as a sound store of value, independent from governments and banks, providing an attractive alternative to traditional financial investments.</p><p>But can it realistically replace fiat currencies to become the money of the future?</p><h2>Bitcoin Attitudes: Progress To Date</h2><p>Ten years ago, only a small niche community was interested in BTC. Now, it is <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/global-cryptocurrency-owners-grow-to-425-million-through-2022">estimated</a> that 425 million people across the world own cryptocurrency, following a 39% growth in digital asset holders in 2022.</p><p>Up until the last few years, it was the norm for many to deride Bitcoin and call it a fraud. But after 2020, a drastic change in attitudes has taken place, with BTC's perception evolving from a speculative investment to a legitimate store of value and medium of exchange.</p><p>The main reason behind this shift is the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Since 2020, institutional investors have entered the market en masse, fueling a major bull run and <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.net/">accumulating</a> more than 7.8% of the total BTC supply as of May 2023. Consequently, bitcoin has become a legitimate asset class that is taken more seriously by more people.</p><p>Moreover, a 2022 Deloitte survey <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/29/deloitte-75-percent-of-retailers-plan-to-accept-crypto-payments-in-2-years.html">revealed</a> that 75% of polled retailers are planning to accept cryptocurrency payments within the next two years.</p><p>Besides that, bitcoin has become legal tender in multiple jurisdictions including, most notably, El Salvador. </p><h2>Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Is Shifting The Narrative</h2><p>Due to the fact that they require significant computational power, Bitcoin mining operations are often associated with high energy consumption. And estimates that suggest these operations<a href="https://rmi.org/cryptocurrencys-energy-consumption-problem/"> consume enough power</a> to rival the annual electricity needs of some entire countries have resulted in Bitcoin facing harsh criticism in recent years, presenting a major barrier to mainstream adoption.</p><p>However, Bitcoin's inherent energy consumption can actually offer significant benefits by stabilizing electricity grids and reducing the cost of power for consumers by balancing supply and demand. </p><p>Monthly and yearly electricity consumption is spread unevenly throughout the day. Peak demand often occurs in the morning and evening hours, while at night and on weekends, it is significantly reduced. In many places, Bitcoin mining may consume only the spare electricity that is not used up by local residents, thus allowing power plants to operate at full capacity. Meanwhile, the average consumers are spared from greater expenses meant to cover the production of that “excess” electricity.</p><p>Moreover, the fierce competition among validators and Bitcoin's deflationary nature incentivize miners to find more efficient and sustainable ways to mine. As the mining process becomes more competitive, miners will likely continue investing in more advanced hardware and software to increase their chances of successfully mining new Bitcoin blocks. In addition, they will also take further steps to use renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, thus reducing mining’s environmental impact even more.</p><p>As a result, I expect the public perception of mining to become more positive in the next five years, and mining itself to become more sustainable as a business.</p><h2>Following the Salvadoran Example</h2><p>In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward accepting bitcoin as a legal payment method. Several countries have legalized using BTC for various purposes, such as buying goods and services or paying taxes.</p><p>In September 2021, El Salvador took this trend further by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-approves-first-law-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-06-09/">becoming</a> the first country to make bitcoin a legal tender currency. Despite a somewhat troubled start, the nation's experiment has come with many positive results, especially if we <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tourism-in-el-salvador-up-30-since-bitcoin-adoption-minister-says">consider</a> the Salvadoran GDP growth of over 10% in 2021 and the 30% increase in tourism since BTC’s adoption.</p><p>I believe more nations will follow El Salvador's footsteps to find an alternative solution to protect their economies against the current economic uncertainty. For example, similar plans to make BTC a legal tender have sprouted up in<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/mexican-senator-plans-to-introduce-bill-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender"> Mexico</a>,<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/arizona-bitcoin-legal-tender-bill-introduced"> Arizona</a> and<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lugano-switzerland-will-make-bitcoin-legal-tender"> Switzerland</a>. Meanwhile, Liechtenstein's upcoming legislation <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/liechtenstein-could-embrace-bitcoin-as-a-payment-method-for-gvmt-services-says-pm/">plans</a> to enable Bitcoin payments for government services.</p><p>However, while the legalization of Bitcoin as a payment method has many advantages, independent cryptocurrencies have always been seen as a threat to fiat. Crypto adoption increasing worldwide is surely the reason why many governments are committed to developing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These are essentially national currencies with state control over their issuance and payment networks.</p><p>Arguably, CBDCs stand a greater chance of gaining mainstream adoption than Bitcoin in the coming years. This is due to their potential for integration with existing financial systems and regulatory frameworks, as well as the backing and support of central banks around the world. However, both Bitcoin and CBDCs are still in the early stages of development, and their adoption will depend on a variety of factors.</p><h2>Is Bitcoin The Currency Of The Future?</h2><p>With a shift in consumer and business attitudes, growing use as a store of value and a medium of exchange, as well as positive developments in the mining industry and among national governments, Bitcoin is gradually progressing toward mainstream adoption.</p><p>As bitcoin use cases continue to expand, I believe more individuals and organizations will realize its potential as a long-term investment tool.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Didar Bekbauov.

The event witnessed notable participation from U.S. presidential candidates and generated enthusiasm, setting the stage for Bitcoin's mainstream adoption. Brandon Green, Head of Staff of Bitcoin Magazine, expressed his excitement, stating, "This year's Bitcoin Conference surpassed all my expectations, becoming a defining moment for the Bitcoin industry."</p><p>The conference also focused on fundraising efforts, with the organization <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/brink-million-dollar-bitcoin-donation-campaign">Brink successfully raising</a> $800,000 USD to support open-source Bitcoin protocol development. Samara Alpha Management and Bitcoin Magazine Pro announced a partnership for The Bitcoin Alpha Competition, offering a chance for startup managers and hedge funds to present their strategies to institutional allocators and potentially win $1 million in seed capital.</p><p>Art and commerce played a significant role at the conference. An art showcase and auction called <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/miami-bitcoin-conference-will-have-ordinals-alley-art-gallery">Ordinal Alley</a> sold 6.38 BTC worth of rare pieces, highlighting the growing interest in Bitcoin and the Ordinals protocol within the art world. The Bitcoin Bazaar facilitated transactions using Bitcoin, while the Bitcoin Magazine store reported that 21% of all transactions were made using Lightning bitcoin payments.</p><p>Keynotes and sessions addressed various aspects of Bitcoin. U.S. Presidential candidates <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/robert-kennedy-jr-debuts-campaign-at-bitcoin-2023">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> (Democratic party) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bc2jRlBunQ">Vivek Ramaswamy</a> (Republican party) shared their visions for Bitcoin in their respective keynotes.

With the help of address tracking, public announcements and some estimation across data sources, we can get a sense of where nearly 47% of total bitcoin supply is today. A considerable portion of bitcoin’s 21-million supply is estimated to be lost, which includes Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins. There’s useful data from both <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=supply.ProvablyLost">Glassnode</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/">Chainalysis</a> to suggest that nearly 4 million bitcoin has been lost.</p><p>Other large amounts of bitcoin are on exchanges, in the Grayscale trust, or in bitcoin miners’ wallets. Swaths of bitcoin have been accumulated by the likes of MicroStrategy, and more recently Tether. Some 5,500 bitcoin are locked up on the Lightning Network, while other sums exist as wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) on blockchains besides Bitcoin.</p><p>Most bitcoin estimates can be tracked on a routine basis when looking at examples, like known U.S. government-associated on-chain addresses from various bitcoin seizures, or when analyzing monthly production updates from public bitcoin miners, while other holding details can be much harder to come by. A private institution may have indicated bitcoin holdings years ago, but isn’t required to publicly announce updates of their stash. Other instances include uncertainty around government holdings. China may have <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1587917712126144512?s=20">194,000 bitcoin</a> from seizure, but it’s difficult to verify if this number is current.</p><p>All that said, the below chart is a rough cut of available data that can be expanded upon and improved for better accuracy across different groups. These figures come from on-chain forensics, public SEC filings and balance sheet attestations.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NDU1ODc4MjcyMTY1NDIy/bitcoin-holdings-by-entity.png" height="310" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Bitcoin holdings separated by type of entity.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Of the 2.3 million of bitcoin on exchanges, the majority resides on Binance and Coinbase. This wouldn’t include bitcoin in investment custody products like Grayscale and Coinbase Custody, for example. Binance’s share of bitcoin on exchanges has risen from under 10% in 2019 up to 30% today. The company is estimated to have nearly 700,000 bitcoin on their platform, which can predominantly be attributed to their derivatives marketplace dominance and their international presence, whereas Coinbase is mainly a spot exchange with a heavy U.S. presence.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The percent share of exchanges' bitcoin balances.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Over time, the amount of circulating bitcoin supply on exchanges has reached 17.5% of circulating supply, reaching its peak in March 2020 before declining to just 11.89%. We suspect that the trend of declining bitcoin on exchanges as a percentage of circulating supply will continue as bitcoin distributes across an increased number of global adopters, thanks to sophisticated personal custody solutions becoming more mainstream and robust as time goes on.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NDU1ODc4MDAzNzI5OTY2/bitcoin-percent-balance-on-exchanges.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>A little less than 12% of circulating bitcoin is held on exchanges.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>In absolute terms, there has never been this level of long-term holders in bitcoin. In relative terms, the only two times in history with a larger share of long-term holder coins is in 2009 before bitcoin had an exchange rate, and in the depths of the 2015 bear market. With so much of the supply off the market, sell-side pressure in the interim can result in large price adjustments to the downside, since many market participants are partaking in more of a passive role.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NDU1ODc4MjcyMjk2Nzg5/long-term-bitcoin-holders-supply.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Long-term holders' percentage of circulating supply is growing.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>We can also look at bitcoin’s illiquid supply to quantify holder dynamics. The term “illiquid supply” refers to bitcoin that are held by entities that rarely sell, meaning these coins are not readily available for trading. To quantify this, an entity's bitcoin holdings are deemed illiquid if less than 25% of its received bitcoins have been spent, liquid if 25% to 75% have been spent, and highly liquid if over 75% have been spent.</p><p>In the post-2016 halving era, bitcoin’s illiquid supply as a percentage of circulating supply is at its highest level, with holder accumulation taking coins off the market faster than miner issuance can distribute them. </p><p>As of this April 2023, bitcoin’s illiquid supply surpassed 15,000,000 coins.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Illiquid bitcoin supply has trended upward since 2016.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>The trend is clear: Bitcoin continues to distribute into more hands, with a greater concentration of supply shifting from entities holding large amounts of bitcoin — balances of 1,000-10,000 BTC, 10,000-100,000 BTC, and greater than 100,000 BTC — to entities holding balances of 10 BTC or less.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin balances of less than 10 bitcoin has been growing for over a decade, meaning supply is getting distributed more evenly.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>It’s important to note that entities holding large amounts of bitcoin, particularly those with 10,000-plus BTC, are likely managing keys for thousands or even millions of users, exchanges being an obvious example. This is often a classic source of mischaracterization and misinformation when people make claims regarding a lack of wealth distribution of bitcoin. Yes, there are clumps of addresses with large holdings of bitcoin, but this is like claiming that one corporation owns 14% of all U.S. dollars in the commercial banking system. While JPMorgan Chase has $2.4 trillion out of $17.1 trillion of deposits in domestic banks and the deposits are a liability of JPMorgan, in actuality, they are custodied for millions of unique individuals and businesses. </p><p>The key difference — aside from the legal versus cryptographic ownership structure — is the fact that bitcoin’s ownership structure, the UTXO set, is much more transparent and easily auditable. This makes it easy for anyone to look at the data and make informed claims about bitcoin’s supply concentration. </p><h2>Final Note</h2><p>Bitcoin has been successful in attracting a broad spectrum of holders, from individuals to corporations, private entities and even nation-states. As evidenced by increasing retail ownership and historically high levels of long-term holders, it’s clear that bitcoin's supply is getting distributed more evenly across this vast array of adopters. This trend is further reinforced by a declining amount of bitcoin held on exchanges and an increasing illiquid supply.</p><p>Moving forward, we anticipate these trends of increased distribution and declining concentration to continue, as bitcoin’s 21,000,000 hard capped supply is divided up between the world’s individuals, institutions, corporations and nation states. </p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Per the complaint, Binance engaged in unregistered offers and sales of securities and made false representations to investors regarding surveillance and controls over manipulative trading.</p><p>According to the SEC’s claim, Binance and its subsidiary, BAM Trading, operated as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing agency without registering with the SEC. The commission also alleges that Binance conducted unregistered offers and sales of its own cryptocurrency assets, as well as profit-generating programs and investment schemes. Specifically, the charges focus on the BNB and BUSD cryptocurrencies launched by Binance, as well as the BNB Vault and Simple Earn programs, “and a so-called ‘staking’ investment scheme available on the Binance.US Platform.” The defendants are accused of depriving investors of material information about these securities and programs.</p><p>Furthermore, the complaint states that Binance and BAM Trading made misrepresentations about the controls implemented on the Binance.US platform, raising significant amounts of money from private investors. The SEC asserts that Binance evaded U.S. laws and regulation by implementing a plan to surreptitiously escape registration requirements. “As Zhao himself acknowledged—Binance did not want to ‘be held accountable’ for these actions,” the filed charges explain. “As the Binance CCO explained, ‘[o]n the surface we cannot be seen to have US users[,] but in reality, we should get them through other creative means.’”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">response</a> to the SEC's complaint, Binance expressed disappointment and emphasized its active cooperation with the SEC's investigations. Binance stated that it had engaged in extensive discussions to reach a settlement but that the SEC chose to act unilaterally. The company said it intends to vigorously defend its platform and criticized the SEC's enforcement approach, calling for more clarity and guidance for the digital asset industry. Binance also refuted allegations that user assets on the Binance.US platform were at risk, assuring customers of the safety and security of their funds.</p><p>The SEC seeks various remedies and resolutions, including a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money penalties and equitable relief.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Over 400 Small Businesses In The Philippines Are Now Accepting Bitcoin Payments]]></title><description><![CDATA[Businesses are taking advantage of the unique benefits the Lightning Network offers through Pouch.ph’s payments platform.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/400-small-businesses-in-the-philippines-are-now-accepting-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/400-small-businesses-in-the-philippines-are-now-accepting-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Philippines]]></category><category><![CDATA[Payments]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 16:52:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzA5OTE3/global-hyperbitcoinization.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://pouch.ph">Pouch.ph</a>, a bitcoin payment firm launched in 2021, has announced that it is enabling over 400 small businesses to accept and process Bitcoin payments in the Philippines. According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, the platform aims to tap into the vast pool of merchants in the country, ranging from mom-and-pop stores to boutique hotels.</p><p>Pouch.ph utilizes the Lightning Network built on top of Bitcoin to facilitate faster, more affordable and user-friendly digital payments. With this payment protocol, customers can pay by scanning a merchant's QR code with any Bitcoin wallet, and Pouch.ph converts the bitcoin to pesos, transferring the funds directly to the merchant's bank or mobile money account.</p><p>According to Ethan Rose, CEO of Pouch.ph, one of the significant challenges faced by small businesses is the limited availability of payment methods, with credit cards charging fees of up to three percent. With the increasing number of internet and smartphone users in the Philippines, accepting bitcoin as a payment method opens up opportunities for those without credit cards or local fiat currency to make online or in-store purchases.</p><p>Some local businesses in Boracay, a popular tourist destination, have already embraced bitcoin payments through Pouch.ph. In the press release, Erielyn Gaston, owner of Kasbar restaurant, highlighted the advantages of accepting Bitcoin, stating that it has allowed her to attract a wider customer base and increase sales. Meanwhile, TIB Market manager Marcel Selfer praised the convenience of a fast and easily available payment service, noting that it provides an alternative to high fees charged by non-bank ATMs for credit card users.</p><p>Expanding its services beyond Boracay, Pouch.ph noted that it has successfully onboarded merchants in cities such as Cebu City, Dumaguete, Iloilo and Bacolod City. Additionally, in Metro Manila, establishments like URBN QC, Draper Startup House and KosneyLand have started accepting bitcoin payments through Pouch.ph. The company also offers a Batch Pay feature, enabling business owners to send payments instantly to employees, suppliers and other recipients, simplifying payment processes.</p><p>To facilitate bitcoin transactions, individuals can utilize <a href="http://btcmap.org/">BTCMap.org</a> to locate merchants that accept Bitcoin payments. Pouch.ph plans to extend its Batch Pay services for over-the-counter remittances through LBC, M Lhuillier and Palawan Pawnshop. By embracing bitcoin, small businesses in the Philippines are capitalizing on the increasing number of internet and smartphone users, while offering customers more diverse and convenient payment options.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzA5OTE3/global-hyperbitcoinization.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Salvador Unleashes "Volcano Energy" With 241 Megawatt Planned Bitcoin Mining Operation]]></title><description><![CDATA[The country of El Salvador is harnessing its energy resources and constructing a renewable power generation park to fuel the growth of Bitcoin mining.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvador-plans-241-megawatt-renewable-plant-for-bitcoin-mining</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/el-salvador-plans-241-megawatt-renewable-plant-for-bitcoin-mining</guid><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy]]></category><category><![CDATA[El Salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Solar]]></category><category><![CDATA[Power Plant]]></category><category><![CDATA[wind]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 13:32:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg0MDA2MjQxMTQ2NjQ0MTY5/volcano.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The country of El Salvador is tapping into its abundant natural resources to create “<a href="https://twitter.com/Volcano_Energy">Volcano Energy</a>.” According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the aim is to position the country as a major global player in the Bitcoin mining industry while promoting energy competitiveness, diversification and geographic expansion for the Bitcoin network. Adopting a debt-free approach, El Salvador plans to construct a 241 megawatt (MW) renewable power generation park in the Metapán region, combining solar and wind projects.</p><p>"This project is a transformative journey that will establish one of the world's largest Bitcoin mining farms," the release said. “Located in the El Shiste hamlet, within the municipality of Metapán, Santa Ana, this chosen site boasts exceptional solar and wind energy yields in the country.” The park will have a capacity of 169MW of photovoltaic solar energy and 72MW of wind energy. The initial computational power is expected to surpass 1.3 EH/s, marking a significant milestone for the country and industry.</p><p>The release stated that “The total commitment for the project is $1 billion, beginning with a first investment of $250 million, bootstrapped by key Bitcoin industry leaders, with collaboration from top developers and manufacturers of renewable energy technology, as well as Bitcoin mining experts on a global scale.” The government of El Salvador will play a crucial role in the planning and execution of the initiative, securing a preferred participation equivalent to 23% of the revenue. The remaining ownership will be divided among investors and reinvested in expanding energy production capacity and advancing Bitcoin mining.</p><p>Robert Warren of Distributed Hash <a href="https://twitter.com/BikesandBitcoin/status/1665719174549626880?s=20">explained on Twitter</a> that the reasoning behind leveraging wind and solar is likely to monetize quicker to build upon a base set of geothermal expansion.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BikesandBitcoin/status/1665719174549626880"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>By leveraging Volcano Energy, El Salvador aims to create a prosperous future driven by sustainable energy and Bitcoin. As the country’s investment progresses volcanoes could serve as the backbone of this transformation, fostering economic growth and prosperity for future generations. The establishment of the renewable power generation park signifies a large step towards achieving these goals while cementing El Salvador's position in the global Bitcoin mining industry.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg0MDA2MjQxMTQ2NjQ0MTY5/volcano.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[We’ve Failed Gen Z, But Bitcoin Offers Hope For The Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[The members of Generation Z have had their futures stolen by monetary mismanagement, but they are poised to rebuild with Bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-might-save-gen-z</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-might-save-gen-z</guid><category><![CDATA[Zoomers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[sound money]]></category><category><![CDATA[debt]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Waugh,Dave Birnbaum]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNTQxOTQxNDY3Nzg0MzE2/silver-or-orange-lining-in-the-clouds-hope-freedom-storm.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by David Waugh, business development and communications specialist at bitcoin investing platform Coinbits, and Dave Birnbaum, the product director at Coinbits.</em></p><p>Every generation has bones to pick with those who came before. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Generation Z</a>, those born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, have an especially valid complaint: Previous generations have stolen their future.</p><p>Also called “the Zoomers,” this group was forced by lockdowns and school closures to socialize through webcams during their formative years. These <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/gen-z-stats">68 million Americans</a> have had their lives disrupted by social upheaval, wealth destruction and cultural decline, all during the prime of their youth.</p><p>Many Zoomers do not yet realize the scale of the crime perpetrated against them. Some are waking up. Either way, all of them will soon need to chip in to pay the piper for decades of monetary and fiscal mismanagement by prior generations.</p><p>But the situation is not hopeless. There is a tool that Generation Z can use to achieve restitution. Instead of embarking on a dismal project to rebuild our ruined financial system, only to reinstate the rents and inequities that existed before, Zoomers can leave their mark upon history by using bitcoin to build a new system that is resilient, equitable and just. </p><p>Like the Greatest Generation, which rebuilt America on strong foundations after facing down the greatest threat to humanity that had ever manifested, Generation Z can channel their well-earned sense of betrayal and loss to create a world order worthy of being passed down to their own children and grandchildren.</p><h2>Backed Into A Corner</h2><p>Sometimes called “<a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/the-loneliest-generation/">the loneliest generation</a>,” Gen Z has been sold out by their elders, who have declined to make the necessary sacrifices to allow future generations to prosper. The psychological warfare waged against Zoomers is sometimes subtle, but often, it is not. In schools, mass media and online, they are assailed with doom about climate, race and exploitation, and told that their future has been stolen by evil people who selfishly refuse to fix those problems. </p><p>In fact, this is a half truth. The Zoomers' future has indeed been stolen, but not by polluters and racists. Instead, globalist elites, smart enough to see their system failing but not courageous enough to take responsibility for it, have looted the financial and cultural capital left to us by the Greatest Generation.</p><p>As part of the coverup for this crime, Zoomers have endured a constant onslaught of depressing propaganda. They are told the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/426353-ocasio-cortez-the-world-will-end-in-12-years-if-we-dont-address/">world will end</a> in 10 years. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-climate-change-keeping-you-up-at-night-you-may-have-climate-anxiety-202206132761">"Climate anxiety" is widespread</a> among a generation that is instructed to feel guilty for their existence rather than called to create new things and solve problems. Previous generations shot for the moon. <a href="https://time.com/6273065/space-travel-climate-impact/">Today’s elites disparage space exploration</a> out of concern that rockets might affect the weather.</p><p>All of this has yielded predictable results. Zoomers experience high rates of suicide, depression, anxiety and many <a href="https://brownstone.org/articles/the-loneliest-generation/">feel that life is meaningless.</a></p><p>Politicians are not likely to offer a solution. Appealing to the voting base of Generation Z is a shameful game of <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-gaslighting-of-the-american-people/">gaslighting</a>, <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/welcome-to-the-frankfurtian-world/">virtue signaling</a> and self-righteous <a href="https://mises.org/library/strange-liberty-politics-drops-its-pretenses">power grabs</a>. Political leaders <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-biden-budget-smoke-mirrors-and-class-warfare/">deny reality</a>, and claim that they can <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/13/remarks-on-executing-a-modern-american-industrial-strategy-by-nec-director-brian-deese/">engineer prosperity</a> using central planning. Government schools and universities generally fail to deliver a quality humanist education, depriving an entire generation of the necessary intellectual tools to notice this deception.</p><h2>Growing Awareness Of The Problem</h2><p>And yet, many members of Generation Z are coming to important realizations as they work their way through the rubble of the university system and join the workforce. We recently caught up with Jack Nicastro, a current Dartmouth College student, who believes he can see through politically motivated pessimism:</p><p>“Mainstream culture is hopelessly (and insupportably) pessimistic, particularly apropos technology,” Nicastro said. “Politicians capitalize on the populace's anxieties about technology, automation and AI with their usual demagoguery to advance illiberal policy agenda, as evidenced by the TikTok hearings.”</p><p>Sid Gundapaneni, a student at Binghamton University, offered a similar perspective, stating he is, “optimistic in a broad sense” regarding living standards, though less certain about the future of freedom:</p><p>“From a liberty standpoint, I'm unable to maintain such confidence — and I believe there are long-term consequences for this,” he said. “But right now, governments and their subsidized industries show no fatigue in their massive growth.”</p><h2>Coming To Terms With The Challenge</h2><p>The fiscal and monetary crises facing Gen Z are significant. The national debt is <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/#">over $31 trillion</a>, and unfunded liabilities exceed $187 trillion. Thanks to a politicized and incompetent Federal Reserve, the American economy is <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-path-to-full-stagflation/">headed toward stagflation</a>, a nasty phenomenon where inflation and unemployment intensify at the same time.</p><p>Leaders from major political parties <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3953384-cassidy-says-biden-and-trump-have-same-plan-on-social-security-which-is-to-do-nothing/">claim</a> Social Security and Medicare reforms are off the table. Brian Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/04/social-security-and-medicare-insolvency-dates-are-a-distraction/">recently stated</a> that both programs “will drive $116 trillion in budget deficits over the next 30 years, according to CBO (Congressional Budget Office) data.”</p><p>Some Zoomers recognize the need for reform. In a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-gen-z-cash-in-on-social-security-reform-insolvency-retirement-savings-accounts-college-university-student-rick-scott-political-capital-e626edd1">Wall Street Journal article</a> featuring student commentary on Social Security, Mark Panjaitan, an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin, stated, “Instead of placing retirement dreams in the hands of a deadlocked Congress, I advise everyone to depend on the fruits of their own labor.”</p><p>Another, Ryan Callahan of the University of Virginia, claimed, “Regardless of the changes Congress makes, Social Security will be a ghost of its former self by the time my generation can collect.”</p><p>With the political process unable to address basic needs for change, let alone ambitious projects that require sacrifice for the sake of future generations, voting and activism cannot solve this problem alone. On our current trajectory, the amount of economic growth that would be needed to pay off our debt is almost mathematically impossible — barring a technology breakthrough that rearranges the chess board.</p><h2>A Generation Primed For Bitcoin</h2><p>A defining characteristic of Zoomers that makes them worthy of their name is that they move incredibly fast. Gen Z was brought up on a media diet of frenetic stimulation. Its members are quick to learn new technologies and good at using them to create novel content, apps and social experiences. </p><p>As McKinsey researchers <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/true-gen-generation-z-and-its-implications-for-companies">noted</a>, “Members of Gen Z… are true digital natives: from earliest youth, they have been exposed to the internet, to social networks, and to mobile systems.” </p><p>This fast-paced, technology-centric way of life primes the Zoomers for Bitcoin. While previous generations might balk at Bitcoin’s unfamiliarity, Zoomers are <em>more</em> comfortable with Bitcoin than they are with traditional banks and financial products. They are well positioned to build out the necessary infrastructure to bring Bitcoin to billions of people — and change the calculus confronting the problems of their time.</p><h2>The Journey Home</h2><p>Although Bitcoin offers hope for Zoomers, they must steel themselves for what is to come — a difficult journey to return to a balanced and free society. Preparing will require independent study, to make up for the miseducation prevalent in government schools and higher education. They will need to organize their own communities using encrypted communication networks in the face of censorship, intimidation and surveillance. They must permeate existing institutions, such as the legal and financial fields, public service and corporate leadership, with the means to impose tough reforms.</p><p>In addition, they will need to understand that Bitcoin provides a key part of these means. Bitcoin is leverage in a world where Gen Z has very little. They’ll need to reject the false promise of “crypto,” and relearn the ancient art of long-term thinking.</p><p>Every generation deals with crises, but some generations are called to especially tough challenges. The Greatest Generation went to war to protect humanity from totalitarian regimes. The Zoomers now must face the repercussions of decades of monetary and fiscal irresponsibility, and the downstream destruction it has wrought on their freedoms and their culture. </p><p>They did not ask for it, but for a generation of young people who struggle to believe that their lives have meaning, the calling to rebuild with Bitcoin is perhaps the greatest blessing they could have received. It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by David Waugh and Dave Birnbaum.

But, much to their chagrin, their victory lap ended up being premature. Bitcoin has come roaring back in 2023, ending these premature celebrations and taking back some of its 2022 losses with a massive <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">year-to-date gain of over 60%</a> as of this writing so far in 2023. </p><p>Here are three reasons behind Bitcoin’s 2023 resurgence: </p><h2>One: Banking Sector Turmoil And A Timely Reminder Of Bitcoin’s Value </h2><p>In March 2023, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/recap-of-last-weeks-banking-contagion-and-bitcoin">turmoil from the banking sector</a> in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse rocked the market with the types of issues that it hadn’t experienced since the Great Recession. This was no fly-by-night operation; at the time, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/13/1163155347/svb-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-bailout-failure#:~:text=via%20Getty%20Images-,Silicon%20Valley%20Bank%20was%20the%2016th%20largest%20bank%20in%20America,group%20texts%20and%20Twitter%20posts.">sixteenth-largest bank in the United States</a> and the bank of choice for many venture capitalists and startups.</p><p>This high-profile implosion and the lack of proper risk management in place at SVB led many individuals to question how safe their money was. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/2023/03/22/what-did-the-fed-do-after-silicon-valley-bank-and-signature-bank-failed/">stepped in to make the bank’s depositors whole</a>, but the event still called the health of the banking system into question. </p><p>While not everyone is rushing to take their money out of banks, many more people are now at least aware of the risks of a single point of failure and are moving to diversify their assets by splitting them between multiple banks or even diversifying into alternatives like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for the first time. </p><p>The appeal of a fully decentralized asset like bitcoin is that there is no CEO or management team in charge that can endanger the solvency of the Bitcoin network by making a bad decision or poor judgment call. Bitcoin users don’t have to trust a company or management team to use Bitcoin; they can instead verify the open-source code that governs the Bitcoin network. Anyone can view any transaction ever made on the Bitcoin blockchain, giving the network unmatched transparency.</p><p>The price of bitcoin surged in March in the wake of the crisis, and in late April, renewed troubles at First Republic Bank, which reported that it <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3959401-first-republic-stock-slides-7-after-deposits-sank-by-more-than-70b-in-q1?hasComeFromMpArticle=false">lost over $70 billion in deposits during the previous quarter</a> propelled bitcoin prices higher yet again, showing that investors and savers clearly view it as a port in the storm amidst the current uncertainty. </p><h2>Two: Dedollarization At A Global Scale</h2><p>In addition to the specific troubles highlighted by the banking crisis, faith in the dollar itself seems to be dwindling globally. Bitcoin isn’t the only indicator here; precious metals like <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-gold-and-silver-prices-surged-today-51667953747">gold and silver are surging</a> while USD reserve currency held by other countries is at its lowest level in decades: from 73% in 2001 to 55% 20 later, in 2021, and down to 47% by April 2022, <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-04-19/USD-is-suffering-stunning-collapse-as-world-s-reserve-currency-warns-Eurizon-SLJ-Capital-s-Jen.html">according to economist Stephen Jen</a>. The yuan is now the <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-04-19/USD-is-suffering-stunning-collapse-as-world-s-reserve-currency-warns-Eurizon-SLJ-Capital-s-Jen.html">most-traded currency in Russia</a> while China and Brazil recently struck an agreement to settle trades in the yuan and real instead of in dollars. Meanwhile, Malaysia is making similar deals with both India and China. </p><p>Former Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jim O’Neill — <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/06/jim-oneill-revisits-brics-emerging-markets.htm">who originated the BRICS acronym</a>, referring to then-emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — recently called on these countries to <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-03-30/Ex-Goldman-chief-economist-calls-on-BRICS-to-challenge-USD-s-dominance-as-China-leads-de-dollarization-trend.html">challenge dollar hegemony</a> with a new native currency. This ambition is likely a bridge too far at this point in time. As a commodity importer, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/02d6ab99-ea36-41c4-9ad3-9658bb1894a7">China’s economic goals</a> aren’t aligned with commodity exporters like Brazil and Russia. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484">tensions between China and India</a> call the likelihood of this coming together into question. Nevertheless, it is another signpost on the road towards global dedollarization. It’s not just BRICs countries that are exploring their options — U.S. allies like French president Emmanuel Macron recently warned that Europe should <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-president-emmanuel-macron-states-europe-must-reduce-its-dependence-on-the-us-dollar-to-avoid-becoming-vassals/">reduce its dependence on the U.S. dollar</a> to avoid becoming “vassals.” </p><p>While none of this means that the end of the dollar’s reign as the global reserve currency is guaranteed or imminent, it does paint the picture that individuals and nations are clearly looking for non-dollar alternatives to diversify into. </p><p>The long-term effects of dedollarization and the banking crisis’ effect on Bitcoin is still being written, but it has made more people aware of Bitcoin as a viable alternative to the current system, and it has certainly served as a catalyst for the price of bitcoin. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, bitcoin climbed from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">just under $20,000 on March 10, 2023 to over $30,000 barely a month later on April 13, 2023,</a> gaining 50% and adding $200 billion to its market capitalization in the process. </p><h2>Three: Development Of The Layer 2 Ecosystem</h2><p>Along with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space">the rise of Ordinals</a>, Bitcoin has benefitted from the further development of its Layer 2 ecosystem, through projects such as Stacks and the Lightning Network. Stacks is a “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/27/allure-of-bitcoin-ordinals-defi-drives-crypto-funds-to-bitcoin-layer-2-token-stacks/">Layer 2 companion chain for smart contracts</a> focused on bitcoin (BTC) … allowing for the creation of related financial products.” At the time of this writing, Stacks <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/">has a market value of nearly $1 billion</a> and is approaching the top-50 cryptocurrencies in market capitalizaiton. </p><p>Recent upgrades to Stacks enable Stacks users to pledge their tokens to secure the network to earn rewards in a manner similar to how networks like Ethereum enable participants to earn rewards by staking their holdings. In this way, Stacks could ultimately end up bringing DeFi to Bitcoin. </p><p>In addition to Stacks, other Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols like Lightning continue to grow. Lightning is focused on making Bitcoin more scalable. Recent research from Glassnode found that Lightning is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">1,000-times cheaper than using legacy payment processors</a> like Visa and Mastercard. Glassnode’s James Check found that the fee for sending 1 BTC across the Lightning Network was 3,000 satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin), which was the equivalent of an $0.84 fee to send $28,000 in dollar terms, or a miniscule fee of just 0.0029%. Payment application Strike uses the Lightning Network to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-growth-is-organic-coming-from-real-world-adoption">facilitate no-fee transfers</a> from the United States to other countries, including Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana and will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/bitcoin-based-app-strike-expands-in-philippines-to-grow-cross-border-payment-solutions/">soon offer it to the Philippines</a>. </p><h2>Bitcoin's Best Days Are Ahead</h2><p>In addition to these macroeconomic factors, the next Bitcoin halving is coming up in 2024. Halvings occur roughly every four years and reduce the rewards for mining new BTC by 50%, essentially increasing the degree of mining difficulty and reducing the supply of bitcoin over time. Halvings have historically been bullish catalysts for bitcoin. </p><p>In 2023, between a changing macroeconomic landscape and the technical and developmental advances surrounding the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin has proven that, not only is it back from the dead, but its best days are likely still ahead of it. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Chen Fang.

History may not repeat itself per se, but as an endless record of follower-humans following leader-humans off of proverbial cliffs demonstrates (and for no other reason than the leader-humans were/are really skilled at lying), it certainly feels like déjà vu all over again. </p><p>Worry not! This is not an article about Trump or about ideological disaffection. Trump is just one man in a human melodrama that spans millennia. The focus of this piece is about the role Bitcoin can play in restoring belief and in ending human somnambulance; it is about how we disempower the disinformationalists. And it is a warning, for those in power will go to any lengths to maintain their hypnotic grip on humanity. </p><h2>Why Governments Fear Bitcoin</h2><p>So, the first question we must examine is this: Why are governments seemingly so afraid of Bitcoin? Interestingly, it’s not simply because Bitcoin has the potential to end governments’ monopoly on money (which is admittedly a pretty big deal in and of itself). No. The underlying reason actually indicates something far more fundamental: Governments are afraid of Bitcoin as a construct because governments can only govern through deceit and dishonesty. </p><p>You see, the most powerful and successful governments throughout history have been (and remain) the ones that are the most adroit and accomplished at lying. The United States government, that bastion of supposed democratic righteousness, is in fact a compelling example of this principle. From Vietnam to Iraq, Joseph McCarthy to Lyndon Johnson to Jerome Powell and beyond, U.S. history is replete with examples of the power of lies, and of the malleability of the minds of well-intentioned, patriotic, innocent, hopeful, lost citizens.</p><h2>Bitcoin Outs The Lies</h2><p>Back to Trump for a moment. This from the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37673797">BBC</a>: </p><p>“Mr. Trump has questioned the legitimacy of the election process in a series of tweets, the latest of which said on Monday: ‘Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day… Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!’ “ </p><p>The above quote is <em>not</em> from the fall of 2020. This is from 2016, when then-candidate Trump was facing then-candidate Hilary Clinton in the general election. Lest we forget, Trump has been making claims of rigged elections for years. A masterful and, in fact, quite sophisticated practitioner in the art of exploiting human neurological frailty, Trump brilliantly leveraged (and <em>continues</em> to leverage) his skills as a purveyor of disinformation. Indeed, tens of millions of Americans <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/40-americans-think-2020-election-stolen-days-before-midterms-1756218">continue to believe</a> that Trump’s claims of election fraud in 2020 are correct, and that the presidency was stolen from him and from his followers. </p><p>I find this entirely fascinating and frightening at the same time.</p><p>The point is not whether Trump’s claims are accurate. And, if I am being honest, I must admit to having no way of knowing whether or not Trump’s claims are true. (The fact is, if I reject his claims, I may simply be choosing to believe the narrative that has been proffered by the other side. Both sides adhere tenaciously to their data. Both sides dwell in echo chambers that reinforce their narratives. Both sides suffer from the anti-intellectual effects caused by the frailties of human neuroplasticity. And both sides are composed of millions of follower-humans, unaware of the power that the leader-humans wield through their manipulations, through their theater, through their deceits.) </p><p>The point here is that, without the capacity to verify Trump’s claims, we are all potential prey; without the ability to know beyond any doubt what really happened in the last election cycle, there is no way to trust the election results — indeed, there is no way to trust our political process at all. </p><h2>Bitcoin And Neuroplasticity</h2><p>Neuroscience 101: Hear something enough and you will believe it to be true. Get on your knees and pray to God every day for an hour, and within months, perhaps weeks, even dyed-in-the-wool atheists will believe in God. Read only articles on Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit, listen only to podcasts by Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck, and you will, beyond any doubt in your mind, believe the election was stolen. Read only articles on Mother Jones and HuffPost and Slate Magazine, and you will believe beyond any doubt in your mind that the election was valid. Listen only to YouTube channels broadcasting the views of Michael Saylor, Balaji Srinivasan, Mark Moss and Jeff Booth and you will believe that bitcoin to $1 million dollars is inevitable, that hyperinflation is coming and that the banks are all going to collapse. Listen only to YouTube channels touting the views of Warren Buffet and Peter Schiff and you will believe Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and a scam. </p><p>Humans are sheep because we are wired to be sheep. We believe that we are critical thinkers and great discerners of truth, but we are all of us just ingesting and internalizing the narratives that we hear, over and over and over again.</p><p>Without verification, we are all potential victims to the lies told by those in power. </p><p>Again, enter Bitcoin.</p><p>As I posited in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/as-trust-erodes-bitcoin-is-verifiable">my previous article</a>, we need to have some imagination. We need to have the willingness to see that, in time, the Bitcoin network could act as the foundational layer to all digital interactions. And in time, there is every possibility that such a network could have the capacity to verify beyond any possible doubt each transaction, each interaction, each news story, each claim by the government, each tweet, etc. </p><p>But here’s the thing: We actually do <em>not</em> need to have much imagination at all to recognize that elections and blockchain technology are present tense, not future tense, considerations.</p><p>Imagine a system in which every ballot is imprinted with a digital private key/signature. All voting records live on an immutable ledger. While this will not disempower those who employ lies and disinformation as a way to manipulate the neurologically susceptible, it will move us in a direction in which claims of voter fraud, like those touted by Trump, have no teeth. And perhaps in time, as Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network proliferates, more such forms of verification have the potential to undercut the liars’ superpower.</p><p>I recognize that at <em>this</em> moment, Bitcoin is feared more for its ability to circumvent monetary control than it is for its inherently truthful nature. U.S. leaders are frightened at the prospect of the dollar losing its status as the world’s reserve currency, and as such, they will do pretty much anything to question and undermine the legitimacy and accessibility of anything that furthers such a possibility. (For example, right now we hear far more about the evils of China and of RNB ascendancy than we do about Bitcoin.) </p><p>But <em>can you see, in a possible future in which lying becomes increasingly difficult, why our leaders might fear Bitcoin so very much? And can you see why our leaders will do anything to stop the ascendency of truth and verification? </em>I have little doubt that, as the Bitcoin network becomes increasingly capable of vetting any and all forms of data, of verifying any and all forms and claims upon truth, that leaders the world over will do everything — <em>everything!</em> — in their power to destroy this network — because without the ability to lie, to manipulate we the sheep, all governments, all centralized power brokers, must by their very nature fail.</p><p>In time, Bitcoin can become so much more than a monetary network. It can become so much more than a store of monetary value. It can become so much more than property. In time, The Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin network can become the very thing that those in power fear most: <em>the truth</em>. </p><p>Where there is truth, the sheep awaken.</p><h2>The Trumps Of The World Must Be Held To Account</h2><p>As I said at the beginning of this piece, this is not a political screed. Politicians lie, regardless of ideology. Leaders on the left are just as apt, just as skilled, at employing disinformation and dishonesty as are those on the right. The point is, without the ability to objectively verify the truth, humans will continue to hurl their mindless selves into the fray, believing to their core the lies proffered by those who benefit from such duplicity. </p><p>I know that many of you reading this will see my views about the evolution of the Bitcoin network as the stuff of fantasy. I ask you though: Throughout human history, hasn’t every advancement at once been thought of as fantastic? Bitcoin is only just beginning. Once our leaders come to realize that, in the not-so-distant future, the Bitcoin network and protocol could morph into a global and inviolable lie detector, they will go to any length to kill it. For they are only as powerful as are the believability of the lies they tell.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dan Weintraub.

Larson shared his personal journey with digital assets, starting in 2016, and his realization of the need for accessible resources and education for individuals interested in Bitcoin. He joined the credit union in 2021 and focused on education and connecting people with resources related to cryptocurrency.</p><p>Meyer emphasized the importance of understanding the material need for Bitcoin services in their community and outlined a strategic four-step approach that prioritizes education and storage, then transactional ability and banking products. Meyer highlighted their focus on education as a way to change the narrative around Bitcoin and address the risks and concerns associated with it.</p><p>Regarding the bitcoin custody solution, Larson stated that they have been working on developing a product that is currently operational but not yet ready for launch to their 25,000 members. The credit union has been prioritizing education both internally and externally, ensuring that their employees and members understand the intricacies and risks of cryptocurrencies. They aim to be a reliable partner for their members, offering safe storage options and guidance without advising specific investments.</p><p>“From an educational perspective, we said, let's really start foundational from the ground floor,” Larson explained. “We're going to walk our members through this high level of education, in an effort to, one, help them become more informed, regardless if they own it today, plan to own it or not, we want our members to be well informed. And then two for those that choose to get into the space, hopefully, they make more informed decisions and understand the risks.” </p><p>The interview also touched on their collaborative approach with regulators to ensure responsible implementation of their Bitcoin services. Larson and Meyer believe that education and storage are areas where they can make a significant impact while working within regulatory frameworks. They have engaged with regulators and are in ongoing discussions to incorporate their feedback into the development of policies and procedures.</p><p>Speaking on the future impact that Bitcoin could have on the traditional finance realm, Meyer said that “If you do nothing, I think you're taking more risk as to where this industry is actually headed in the future, and how it will actually impact us to a significant degree. And if you don't want to be on the receiving end of how others have developed this, you should probably get involved now.” </p><p>Overall, St. Cloud Financial Credit Union's approach to Bitcoin reflects a commitment to educating their members and working collaboratively with regulators to navigate the evolving landscape of Bitcoin. While <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/self-custody">self-custody</a> is inherently the most safe method of storing bitcoin, in a world where education on Bitcoin is lacking credit unions can serve in an educational role. In addition, innovations like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fediment-evolution-of-bitcoin-custody">Fedimints</a> could help create custodial solutions that help retain the properties of Bitcoin that make it sovereign money, while still ensuring a level of distributed responsibility that makes those involved more comfortable.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMTczNDY5NTEyNTc0NjIy/bitcoin-blockchain.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Breaking Barriers: How Bitcoin Can Transform The Real Estate Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[By eliminating middlemen and giving buyers a better form of money, Bitcoin can bring distinct advantages to the real estate industry.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-makes-real-estate-transactions-faster-more-secure</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-makes-real-estate-transactions-faster-more-secure</guid><category><![CDATA[Payments]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Real estate]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transactions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Collateral]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jenna Hall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MTk5ODkzNTczNjc0Nzc2/20220501_btcfinal_best-jimmy-song---property-rights-bitcoin-songsheet-custom-art_-v2.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Jenna Hall, a content marketing specialist with residential real estate brokerage Redfin.</em></p><p>You may have heard about how you can use bitcoin to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/can-you-buy-a-house-with-bitcoin">buy a house</a>, rent an apartment or save your wealth in an inflation-resistant way to make a down payment. But, beyond these examples, how else can Bitcoin transform the way real estate transactions work as a whole? </p><p>From cutting out middlemen to creating new collateral opportunities, Bitcoin can transform the traditional real estate industry in ways we never imagined. For instance, imagine buying a house without the need for banks or intermediaries, and completing the transaction within minutes instead of weeks. It may sound like a futuristic concept, but it’s slowly becoming a reality. </p><p>This article explores the exciting intersection of Bitcoin and real estate, and delves into the potential implications for the future of the real estate market. Whether you’re a homeowner, investor or simply curious about the latest advancements, read on to discover how Bitcoin is reshaping the landscape of real estate transactions.</p><h2>More Secure Transactions</h2><p>Real estate fraud continues to pose a threat to both buyers and sellers, with the FBI reporting over <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2022_IC3Report.pdf">11,700</a> victims in 2022 alone. However, Bitcoin has the potential to play a significant role in addressing traditional real estate fraud.</p><p>Bitcoin transactions are secured by cryptography, and once completed, are highly resistant to fraud. The cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin provide robust security measures against double spends, ensuring that transaction records on the blockchain remain tamper proof and protected. This added layer of security significantly reduces the risk of fraudulent alterations to payment or property records. And because all parties involved in a Bitcoin transaction — including a home buyer, seller, real estate agent and other relevant parties in a real estate transaction — would have access to the blockchain, they can collectively validate the property ownership and transaction details.</p><p>With Bitcoin, property ownership could also be verified through the world’s most robust blockchain, which can serve as a comprehensive and auditable record of ownership transfers. This feature could help establish a clear chain of title, allowing buyers to ensure the legitimacy of the property's ownership history before making a purchase. By eliminating ambiguity and providing verified ownership records, Bitcoin can prevent title fraud — a scam whereby criminals sell properties that they do not rightfully own.</p><h2>No More Middlemen </h2><p>Buying a home is complicated enough, and it can get even more complicated when you have to communicate with several parties to facilitate the transaction. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. Bitcoin is capable of facilitating secure digital real estate deals, which can eliminate the need for intermediaries like lawyers and bankers.</p><p>Traditionally, multiple parties handle listings, payment transactions and legal documentation, leading to complexity and additional costs. Bitcoin could theoretically take the place of the verification or payments services that these middlemen provide, streamlining the transaction experience. Buyers and sellers would benefit from reduced commissions and fees usually charged by lawyers and banks. Additionally, cutting out intermediaries accelerates the home buying or selling process, which provides a more cost-effective, efficient and competitive approach for both the buyer and seller.</p><h2>New Luxury Real Estate Investors</h2><p>Bitcoin has also opened up new opportunities in the luxury real estate market. High-end real estate properties, such as mansions, penthouses and vacation homes, are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2022/05/07/crypto-just-became-real-estates-hottest-new-thing-heres-what-the-bitcoin-revolution-means-for-buyers-sellers-and-developers/?sh=7cb7800f388b">increasingly</a> being listed for sale in bitcoin or other digital currencies. This provides an alternative payment option for high-net-worth individuals who may hold significant amounts of bitcoin and would like to use it to invest in real estate. Additionally, the use of bitcoin in luxury real estate can attract international buyers, as it offers a faster and more secure cross-border transaction option compared to <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/global/real-estate-practices-around-the-world">traditional</a> overseas buying methods.</p><p>Newly-minted bitcoin millionaires and billionaires are showing a love for real estate, flooding the luxury market and driving some of the most expensive transactions over the past several years. Among the most notable include Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee of Coinbase and the founder of Polychain Capital, who bought a mansion in Hollywood Hills for <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/crypto-kingpin-olaf-carlson-wee-200452491.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACeKjjkndDF4c9MSaQARRyAEYe2MkZLNQkzq-akn_nevrMIKiACqtddwDpELMZhsXALRhoIdyTIY10CVxQlK3YzMLZo9Zx5esne83bX6axZqnPghtijCqpIgbBJ98soeirOePTEQU_EUQStB8qHuadoogoQkFGDRVswWtLF6jDhs">$28.5 million</a> and Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, who bought a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-ceo-brian-armstrong-buys-los-angeles-home-for-133-million-11641249787">$133 million</a> estate in Bel Air, California. Armstrong’s massive purchase still ranks in the top five most-expensive single-family homes ever sold in the <a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/11203/CA/Los-Angeles/apartments-for-rent">Los Angeles</a> area.</p><h2>A Better Payment Option</h2><p>One of the most intriguing developments in the real estate industry is the ability to purchase homes using bitcoin. While many Bitcoin users prefer to hold onto their BTC as a long-term investment, others choose to realize the distinct advantages that Bitcoin payments offer over fiat ones.</p><p>In fact, a <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2023/04/20/500k-or-175-bitcoin-texas-startup-lets-people-buy-real-estate-with-cryptocurrency/">Texas startup</a> recently made headlines by allowing Texans to buy homes with bitcoin. Buyers can choose to pay in dollars or their bitcoin equivalent for a property, highlighting the growing acceptance of bitcoin as a legitimate form of payment in the real estate market.</p><h2>Unique Collateral Opportunities</h2><p>Bitcoin could also be used as a new form of collateral in real estate transactions. According to the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions">IRS</a>, bitcoin holdings are considered property. At many banks, borrowers can use their holdings as collateral to secure loans for property investments, providing an alternative financing option for real estate purchases or developments. </p><p>This can be particularly useful for investors who hold significant amounts of bitcoin, but don’t want to sell their holdings to finance a real estate transaction. Lenders, on the other hand, can benefit from a wider addressable market when accepting cryptocurrency as collateral.</p><h2>The Evolving Landscape</h2><p>So, what does the future look like?</p><p>As Bitcoin continues to draw attention, regulatory frameworks are likely to evolve. Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are grappling with the implications of Bitcoin in real estate, including issues related to property rights, taxation and anti-money laundering regulations.

The report revealed a significant increase in cryptocurrency adoption among individuals in the UAE, with many using it for in-person purchases. Additionally, the study indicated a strong intention among non-owners to enter the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>Speaking about the application, Gemini leadership expressed their vision of providing a safe, secure, and user-friendly platform for customers in the UAE and beyond. The company stated that it is eager to serve the rapidly growing and vibrant crypto community in the region. </p><p>In January, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/gemini-alleges-dcg-genesis-defrauded-users">wrote a letter to its parent company</a> Digital Currency Group (DCG) alleging that DCG defrauded Gemini customers in relation to Gemini Earn.

The machines were acquired at a lower price than the current market average, costing $23 per terahash, according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The purchase agreement states that 6,000 of the machines will be shipped in June, with the remaining 6,500 set for shipping in August.</p><p>Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, expressed his confidence in the purchase, stating, "This purchase ensures that we are prepared to meet and potentially exceed our year-end target of 16 EH/s and also positions us to be one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis." He further highlighted the optionality provided by the additional machines, allowing the company to replace less efficient units if the economics support it.</p><p>CleanSpark reported that it has been taking advantage of discounted machine purchases during the crypto bear market. In February, the company acquired <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-20000-bitcoin-miners">20,000 Antminer S19j Pro+ units,</a> followed by the purchase of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-to-nearly-double-bitcoin-mining-capacity">45,000 Antminer S19 XP units in April</a>. <br><br>Gary A.

With fees from Ordinals inscriptions boosting the revenue for miners, it is expected that large players like CleanSpark will continue to bolster their miner inventory.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgwODA0OTg3MjcyODMyMDg4/mining-rigs.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Should A Bitcoin Wallet Have Rights?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Like corporate entities or intelligent robots, Bitcoin wallets are poised to gain legal rights of their own.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/why-bitcoin-wallets-should-have-legal-rights</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/why-bitcoin-wallets-should-have-legal-rights</guid><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Wallets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Artem Afian]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTc0ODk3/bitcoin-legal-regulation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Artem Afian, a lawyer and “legal futurist” at Hiveon, a crypto mining ecosystem that offers services for Bitcoin mining hardware.</em></p><p>I want to draw your attention to the fact that Bitcoin transactions <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-are-bitcoin-wallets">ultimately occur between wallets</a>. There are humans behind wallets, but this connection is not really what’s important. The pseudonymity of Bitcoin is thanks to the fact that there is no direct connection between the wallet and the person who owns it. It is what distinguishes a Bitcoin wallet from any other financial instrument. No matter how much regulators try to change this, the core of the technology remains the same. </p><p>What does this mean? It means that, soon, wallets will be recognized as entities deserving of legal rights.</p><p>First, humanity <a href="https://aldf.org/article/laws-that-protect-animals/">began to recognize animal rights</a>. Now, there is talk about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robots-ai-legal-rights-3c47ef40">the legal rights of a robot</a>. Soon, the rights of a Bitcoin wallet will come to the fray. </p><p>When one talks about the rights of robots, they usually refer to some imitation of human will that is deserving of legal recognition. We understand that a robot does not have a soul in the same way that a human does, but at the same time, it performs rather complex actions, which gives rise to legal consequences. For many of us, a robot or a Bitcoin wallet is something inanimate and devoid of a soul and, perhaps, therefore undeserving of legal protections. But we recognize the rights of companies and corporations and, of course, it is difficult to imagine more soulless forms than those. It turns out that the subjects of law can be inanimate.</p><p>So, what is the difference between a Bitcoin wallet and a legal entity? A legal entity is simply a set of files in a specific registry. Lawyers even have a theory of the “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_fiction#:~:text=Legal%20fiction%20is%20an%20assumption,letter%20of%20the%20law%20unchanged.">fiction of a legal entity</a>.” We will calmly confirm that the legal entity is an American corporation. We can quickly check this. But how to check that a legal entity was created, say, under the laws of the country of Swaziland? Even if I show you documents that prove it, they are unlikely to tell you anything. So, if I tell you that you are dealing with a foreign company, you most probably just have to believe it. </p><p>Nevertheless, this legal entity, displayed as it is only on paper, has some rights. So, the Bitcoin wallet that exists is even more tangible than many legally-protected entities. Therefore, one more conclusion: Since legal entities have rights, then a wallet may have rights. Just like legal entities, wallets perform transactions, and just like legal entities, wallets can change their owners. This fact never changes: if robots or legal entities are deserving of legal rights, so too are Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>I think Bitcoin is an exciting new space and that we still have a lot to explore. Now, my idea that Bitcoin wallets will inevitably receive legal rights of their own may seem crazy, but many more discoveries await us.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Artem Afian.

This term came about as a catchall when some people incorrectly used or purposefully misused opcodes to create inscriptions that were not able to be indexed by ord and would therefore be unrecognized and not given an inscription number. </p><p>This issue was first mentioned on April 25 in the <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/issues/2045">ord github</a> and the interim fix proposed by then lead developer Casey Rodarmor was to, “Modify ord to recognize the above currently invalid inscriptions, including retroactively in old blocks, but consider these new inscriptions ‘cursed’ and assign them negative inscription numbers.”</p><p>Funnily enough, the example inscription code on the Ordinals docs website would have been a cursed inscription.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/cbspears/status/1663292796306874369"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/cbspears/status/1663292796306874369">Link to embedded Tweet.</a></em></p><p>There are many ways cursed inscriptions can be created. Any inscription with multiple inputs/outputs would be considered cursed. As shown above, certain misuse of opcodes such as OP_1 can lead to cursed inscriptions. Alternatively, the introduction of OP_66 using a value of “cursed” intentionally made these types of inscriptions by having an even numbered opcode which is not indexed by ord. Unless already defined in the spec, even numbered opcodes are not recognized because they are reserved for future protocol development.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/issues/2045">Issue #2045</a>&nbsp;lists some of the ways it's possible to create cursed inscriptions:</p><ul><li>Multiple inscriptions per transaction, for efficient batching.</li><li>Inscriptions on inputs after the first, which is useful for collections.</li><li>Multiple inscriptions on the same sat, so that the entire history of a sat doesn’t need to be checked to determine if a new inscription is valid.</li><li>Inscriptions with unrecognized even headers, so that new even headers don't cause upgraded clients to disagree about inscription numbers.</li></ul><p>There are a couple specific debates around cursed inscriptions. One of the disputes comes from the way that these inscriptions are currently numbered. Cursed inscriptions are numbered negatively in the order of their creation. Because of this numbering system and naming convention, some people purposefully chose to create inscriptions and collections that appear “cursed” whether by flipping the image of a positively numbered inscription or using a more sinister image theme when inscribing. The question is: Should these be appended to the index of positively numbered inscriptions or should they keep their negative inscription number when the code is updated?</p><p>Additionally, another contentious conversation is what to do about the certain type of cursed inscriptions that used the OP_66 opcode in their creation. Because this opcode is not recognized by ord and even numbered opcodes are intentionally left out for future development use, it is debatable whether inscriptions using this opcode should be included in the cursed set or if they should be rejected.</p><p>At the present time, the <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2109">issue around the even number opcode</a> is listed in the ord github. There are many comments in support of including these inscriptions in the index, but the lead maintainers of the protocol seem to be against it. As of now, the current stance by the developers is that these inscriptions would be unbound, meaning that they would not be assigned to a specific satoshi.</p><p>Remember, ordinal theory works based on a first in, first out tracking system for satoshis. Each inscription is assigned to the first satoshi in the genesis transaction when the inscription is created. This type of lens for looking at bitcoin allows images, files, text, etc. to be tracked and transferred. If a cursed inscription is unbound, it would not be associated with a specific satoshi and therefore would be unable to be transferred to another address. Many people who are inscribing are hoping to be able to sell or transfer their inscription to another person. While the inscriptions using this opcode will live forever on the Bitcoin blockchain, if these inscriptions are classified as unbound and unassigned to a specific satoshi, users who minted cursed inscriptions using this opcode would be unable to sell or transfer them.</p><p>Herein lies one of the bigger concerns for people who are spending money on transaction fees to create cursed inscriptions. If they are unable to sell them in the future, significant funds would have been wasted on fees. Many users have responded to the github issue, expressing support for including these inscriptions, but the code’s maintainers are not in favor of recognizing cursed inscriptions using the OP_66 even numbered opcode.</p><p>On May 30, the new lead maintainer of ord, Raphjaph, <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2109#issuecomment-1568125568">wrote</a>, “As the protocol currently stands inscriptions are not valid if they use an unrecognized even tag, so this change already makes a concession by recognizing them. For now they are unbound but we might reconsider this and bind them in the future if there are strong reasons.”</p><p>This response is not what many inscribers were hoping to hear. Similar to Bitcoin, ord is open-source software so users can fork the code if they wish to recognize these specific types of cursed inscriptions. This contentious debate is ongoing and the path forward for ord remains to be seen. Users who spent significant sums on transaction fees may be willing to switch to a new version of ord that will recognize their cursed inscriptions, but this is only a theoretical path forward at this time.</p><p>Regardless, Ordinals are a new technology being built on Bitcoin. Whether inscriptions are a flash in the pan or if they have lasting power may depend on how this issue gets resolved.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzM1ODc0ODQyNTAyNTQ4/fiat-morals-angel-devil.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Liquidators Of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research Have Scavenged $110 Million Of Bitcoin After Losing Billions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Analysis by Arkham Intelligence indicates that Alameda's liquidators have managed to acquire slightly more than 4,000 bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-frieds-alameda-research-has-scavenged-110-million-of-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-frieds-alameda-research-has-scavenged-110-million-of-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[FTX]]></category><category><![CDATA[chainanalysis]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bankruptcy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 18:51:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzEwNDE2/markets-trade-analysis-of-bitcoin-price.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Liquidators in charge of the recovery of assets for the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx-largest-crypto-fraud-history">now-disgraced Alameda Research</a> hedge fund founded by Sam Bankman-Fried currently control over $110 million worth of bitcoin held in various wallets, according to a report supplied by blockchain analysis firm <a href="https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/">Arkham Intelligence</a>.

    </figure><p>The article featured a sweeping <a href="https://www.tributemedia.com/blog/what-is-a-hero-banner">hero video banner</a>, which was also used as a still image for social media sharing, <a href="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/03/27/107205_1_bitcoin_wg_1080p.mp4">showing smog-filled aerial drone footage</a> over operations run by Bitdeer, a Bitcoin mining company that occupies a previously-abandoned aluminum smelting plant on the outskirts of Rockdale. However, evidence suggests that the footage may have either been <a href="https://youtu.be/oN-dFfRPEkg?t=95">manipulated</a> or lacks the necessary color grading that would have maintained photojournalistic integrity and adhered to ethical standards.</p><h2>Color Histograms And Image Manipulation</h2><p>Color histograms are <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/how-to-read-your-cameras-histogram">useful for analyzing the exposure and color balance of an image</a>. A color histogram is essentially a bar chart where the left side of the x-axis is black and the right side is white. The y-axis represents the number of pixels found in the image, for each part of the tonal scale between black and white. A properly exposed photograph, where the full spectrum of tonal blacks and whites are naturally found in a scene, will have <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/histograms-your-guide-to-proper-exposure/">pixels that span across the entire x-axis, from left to right</a>. When color data fails to span the entire x-axis, it can show that either those tones were entirely unavailable to the camera sensor, or that manipulation was performed to purposefully omit those colors.</p><p>In the side-by-side comparison below, the color histogram in <a href="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/03/27/107205_1_bitcoin_wg_1080p.mp4">the aerial footage published by the Times</a> (left) has no pixels approaching the black point. This is particularly strange for footage that has bright sun and stark shadows that are clearly visible as the camera moves over the scene. When color parameters are enhanced and corrected (as shown below in the version on the right), a brighter and more stunning scene emerges.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>The </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_histogram"><em>color histogram</em></a><em> for the image on the left, </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html"><em>featured on The New York Times</em></a><em>’ website, has a distinct gap between its color data and its black point, possibly indicating either an </em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rescuing-poorly-exposed-photos-with-photoshop-levels/"><em>improperly exposed image</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://youtu.be/oN-dFfRPEkg?t=95"><em>manipulation to add a smog effect</em></a><em>.

    </figure><p>The hazy footage used by the Times may give readers a false impression that rural Texas air has been polluted by Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mines are fully electrified and, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle">electric vehicles</a>, the mining facilities photographed by The Times have <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotPlatforms/status/1645473961004892162">zero Scope 1 carbon emissions. In other words,</a> there are <a href="https://youtu.be/JKXeeiCa5Wg?t=1266">no direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions</a> that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by the operators of the mines. Any indirect <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidance">Scope 2 emissions</a> associated from mining’s energy use comes from the grid’s normal emissions.</p><h2>Reply Hazy, Try Again</h2><p><br>The alleged manipulation appears to have been indirectly confirmed by Jordan Vonderhaar, the freelance photographer who took the aerial footage in question. Vonderhaar published <a href="https://archive.ph/QVUQ9">another photo from the same drone</a> flight on his <a href="https://www.jordanvonderhaar.com">personal website</a>, showing that the weather was perfectly clear within moments of the hazy photo published by the Times. This clear photo, from a different angle, indicates that the missing color data in the hazy photo was not due to weather conditions.</p><figure>

Normalizing the black and white points on Vonderhaar's portfolio image reveals vibrant colors and a sunny morning in Rockdale. Notice in the side-by-side comparison below that the Times intentionally cropped out some of the blue skies when it published this particular shot:</p><figure>

Yet, the golden hues from the morning sunlight and blue skies are completely missing from the hazy hero footage. That a perfectly gorgeous moment in Rockdale could suddenly become hazy, at all altitudes and distances only nine minutes later, is nearly impossible.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Responding to allegations of manipulation, Vonderhaar — who described miners as “<a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645446668635058176">massive polluters</a>” — <a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645455851006640130">publicly stated on Twitter</a> that, “Nothing about the footage was doctored. It’s humid most mornings in Texas and when the sun rises you get low level haze. This is very common.”</p><p>Leaving aside for a moment that Vonderhaar appears to be admitting that he was perhaps intentionally seeking out hazy weather for his photojournalistic spread, the nearest <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/automated-surface-weather-observing-systems">automated weather observation station</a>, located at Hearne Municipal Airport — <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Alcoa+Lake,+Texas/Hearne+Municipal+Airport,+Crennan+Ln,+Hearne,+Texas+77859,+United+States+Crennan+Ln,+Hearne,+TX+77859/@30.7454462,-97.0029044,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x8644565ac202de19:0x7acb102f329d74aa!2m2!1d-97.0565663!2d30.5768948!1m5!1m1!1s0x8645cfa9fc4816af:0x37f2f4dc3c4a3e63!2m2!1d-96.6193961!2d30.8697362">40 miles to the Northeast</a> and well out of view of the aerial photography — <a href="https://weatherspark.com/h/d/145983/2023/2/28/Historical-Weather-on-Tuesday-February-28-2023-at-Hearne-Municipal-Airport-Texas-United-States">reported low-level fog</a> at that same moment. </p><p>Indeed, Vonderhaar's clear and sunny photo shows low-level fog on the distant horizon, many miles beyond Alcoa Lake. “Low-level” fog is not a high-altitude phenomenon, and sure enough, Vonderhaar's photo shows blue skies in the upper atmosphere and golden hues that are conspicuously missing in his smoggy footage, taken a few minutes later.</p><h2>Problems Uncovered</h2><p><br><a href="http://twitter.com/roryhighside">Rory Highside</a> — a VFX artist who has <a href="https://youtu.be/MT9PA5EvMuo">expertise in CGI video effects</a> — was among the first to notice problems with the footage that the Times had used. Analyzing the video and color histograms, Highside suspected that either the color grading was mishandled or the color balance <a href="https://twitter.com/roryhighside/status/1645726015233351680">had been manipulated</a>. One of the most noticeable issues was that the “black point” was extended, which is indicative of footage <a href="https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/18821/how-to-best-methods-to-correct-washed-out-jpegs">that is washed out</a>. This was evidenced by the fact that, as colors approached black, there was a noticeable and unnatural gap between pitch black and the available color data where darker colors should be. Vonderhaar did not respond to these allegations on Twitter, and did not respond to questions about them by email.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Hazy Truth Of Photojournalism</h2><p>Determining truth in photojournalism is a murky endeavor. The raw footage captured by professional-grade digital cameras can be thought of as the digital version of undeveloped film. Camera sensors capture raw data, which <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000241.shtml">retains maximum image information and flexibility</a> during post-processing, but requires processing and interpolation to produce an accurate final image. The photographer must adjust various parameters, such as contrast, white balance, exposure, and color saturation — meaning the photographer always has some artistic leeway in the final product. Color manipulations are trivial adjustments in post production. It only takes <a href="https://twitter.com/level39/status/1646204720963371014">one slight adjustment</a> to wash out an image. Minor adjustments are very common, and typically not an issue. But, at the end of the process, photographers have to walk a fine line between ​​enhancing an image for visual impact and maintaining its authenticity.</p><h2>Unedited Raw Drone Footage Is Visibly Hazy</h2><p><br>There is perhaps an alternate explanation for why Vonderhaar’s video footage was so hazy and lacking in contrast, while his still photograph taken nine minutes earlier was sunny and cinematic. The FC220 camera on Vonderhaar’s DJI Mavic Pro drone is <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile">capable of capturing video footage in a logarithmic (log) color profile</a>. Raw log footage is a flat and low-contrast format — not intended for publishing — that preserves a wide dynamic range of details, which allows for greater flexibility during post-processing. Much like how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)">negative film</a> has inverted colors that enable positive images to be developed, log video footage <a href="https://youtu.be/pI9vIUwqLO0">always appears hazy when its raw, unedited format isn’t properly color graded</a>. It would be the photojournalist’s responsibility, then, to accurately map to the colors they witnessed in real life.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MzEzOTk0NTY0NDEyOTc0/color-grading.jpg" height="329" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>DJI drones can record in a logarithmic (log) color profile, </em><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile"><em>which appears hazy if it isn’t color graded in post-processing</em></a><em>. Source: “</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccPJWVTdyA8"><em>Shooting In D-Log - DJI Mavic Pro</em>.”</a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>To convert log footage to an accurate color profile, a process called “<a href="https://youtu.be/o1m4LQu6BGQ">color grading” or “color correction” is typically performed</a>. This involves adjusting the image's color and tonal properties to achieve a more visually pleasing and accurate representation of the scene. <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/4978813437/how-to-shoot-log-video-using-dji-s-d-log-color-profile">The proper conversion from log</a> involves mapping the tonal values in the log footage to their corresponding values, such as with lookup tables, or LUTS, to color grade the final footage.</p><p>Vonderhaar could very well have been telling the truth when he <a href="https://twitter.com/jordan_vondy/status/1645455851006640130">claimed</a> that “Nothing about the footage was doctored.” Indeed, publishing unedited log footage without proper color grading would quite literally result in a misleading smog effect, without having to do anything. Doing this deliberately, of course, would be unethical if it intentionally misleads viewers into seeing smog that did not exist.</p><p><a href="https://nppa.org/resources/code-ethics">Photojournalists have a duty</a> to maintain journalistic integrity and adhere to ethical standards to truthfully convey the events they witnessed. While there is no definitive "correct" color to any image, intentionally misleading readers by failing to color grade log footage is a breach of ethical standards. Photojournalists must depict the scene as faithfully as possible, avoiding anything that might distort reality. Publishing raw and uncorrected video footage, which actively removes colors from a scene and creates a misleading smog effect, is effectively a passive form of photographic manipulation. If not manipulation, then it is an egregious example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon’s razor</a>.</p><p>It should be noted that Vonderhaar’s lack of color grading may not be due to malice or even artistic bias. While a professional photographer <a href="http://jordanvonderhaar.com">who has expertise in color correcting raw still images</a> to JPEG may possess a solid foundation in color correction and a good understanding of color theory, it does not automatically mean they have the necessary skills to color grade log video footage. Color grading log video <a href="https://youtu.be/DBo3zsQq6mY">involves a different set of skills and considerations</a> compared to <a href="https://youtu.be/mPvJkhnB4xg">color correcting raw still images</a>. Expertise in video editing software and a specific understanding of the technical aspects of working with video formats — such as frame rates, codecs and color spaces — is a requirement to adeptly work with log footage. Managing temporal continuity and ensuring consistent color grading is critical to maintaining visual coherence. It’s entirely plausible that Vonderhaar was simply unable to color grade log video. But, whether it be malice or inability, the Times should issue a correction.</p><h2>The Signature Style Of The Times</h2><p><br>The Times has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/jz4ver/what_creates_a_new_york_timesstyle_photograph/">signature style for its photographs</a>, where it typically&nbsp;extends the white point to darken&nbsp;images when it wants to portray a somber or moody tone. However, an extended black point — resulting in washed out colors — is the direct opposite of this iconic style.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MzEzOTk0NTY0Njc1NDEz/nyt-signature-style-histogram.jpg" height="476" width="620">

    </figure><h2>The Ethics Of Photo Manipulation</h2><p>All photography requires some form of color correction. Minor stylistic choices aside, adjustments that actively mislead readers <a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">are unethical</a>. A <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world-press-photo-manipulation-ethics-of-digital-photojournalism/">2015 article in the Times</a> about a World Press Photo research project, for instance, explained that photo editors cross an ethical line, which becomes explicit manipulation, when their processing obscures an image to create conditions that were not actually in the scene:</p><blockquote><p>“The only point at which processing becomes manipulation is when the toning is so great — usually by transforming significant parts of an image to opaque black or white — that it obscures substantial detail.”&nbsp;</p><p>–“<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/world-press-photo-manipulation-ethics-of-digital-photojournalism/">Debating The Rules And Ethics Of Digital Photojournalism</a>,” The New York Times</p></blockquote><p>According to Highside, the extent of the manipulation and our ability to restore the full color potential will remain unknown unless Vonderhaar releases his original raw footage. The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) recommends in its <a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">code of ethics</a> that journalists need to be proactive about addressing concerns and allegations of improper conduct:</p><blockquote><p>“Ethical journalism means taking responsibility for one’s work and explaining one’s decisions to the public. Journalists should: Explain ethical choices and processes to audiences. Encourage a civil dialogue with the public about journalistic practices, coverage and news content. Respond quickly to questions about accuracy, clarity and fairness. Acknowledge mistakes and correct them promptly and prominently. Explain corrections and clarifications carefully and clearly. Expose unethical conduct in journalism, including within their organizations. Abide by the same high standards they expect of others.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="http://spj.org/ethicscode.asp">SPJ code of ethics</a></p></blockquote><p>Despite the missing color data, which can only be sourced from Vonderhaar’s unreleased raw footage, Highside was able to partially restore the washed out footage to demonstrate what the imaging could have looked like if a proper color grading had been applied. The results are striking when compared alongside the video that was published by the Times:</p><figure><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://content.jwplatform.com/players/J0dequ6B-6eHuiRBi.html" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>New York Times Color Profile Comparison (; 0:27) </figcaption></figure><p>Intentionally deciding not to color grade or fully correct log footage is a breach of ethical standards in photojournalism. However, if it was due to lack of ability, it can still be considered a breach of ethical standards, particularly if the Times fails to correct the misinformation or take appropriate action to rectify the situation. A <a href="https://nppa.org/resources/code-ethics">fundamental principle</a> of photojournalism is to provide an accurate and truthful representation of events. Misrepresenting the visual aspects of a scene goes against this principle and compromises the integrity of the profession. It undermines the credibility of photojournalists and the publication, it damages the reputation of the profession and erodes public trust in the media.</p><p>It should not go unnoticed that the actual substance of the Times article included <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/articles/the-absurdity-of-the-nyts-latest-bitcoin-hit-piece">significant misinformation</a>. Why the Times <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-the-new-york-times-attacks-bitcoin">is seemingly motivated</a> to deliberately portray Bitcoin mining in such a negative light is unclear. But it&nbsp;appears to fit <a href="https://www.thegrayladywinked.com">a long pattern of distortions and bias</a> from the newspaper, which has become more evident to readers in recent years. When the public is being misled by photojournalists into believing a small and rural Texas town has thick smog typically found in populated and polluted cities, it’s necessary and appropriate to question the paper’s ethical choices.</p><p>Vonderhaar could clear up suspicions over his work by releasing the original raw log footage.

VP of Research at Riot Platforms Pierre Rochard <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinPierre/status/1663587667764736001?s=20">expressed gratitude</a> to everyone involved, stating, "Texas will continue to be #Bitcoin country!"</p><p>These legislative outcomes will contribute to the growth and stability of Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. As Brian Morgenstern, head of public policy at Riot Platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/MorgensternNJ/status/1663601172651835425?s=20">reported</a>, SB 1751 did not pass, ensuring the continuation of the state's usage of Bitcoin miners’ flexibility in balancing and stabilizing the power grid. </p><p>In contrast, SB 1929 successfully passed, establishing a registration process for Bitcoin miners to share information with ERCOT, enhancing transparency and grid reliability. Additionally, HB 591 was approved, providing a tax incentive for utilizing gas that would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere for on-site Bitcoin mining, promoting emissions reduction.</p><p>Another significant development was the passing of HB 1666, which introduced a proof-of-reserves regime, positioning Texas as a leader in building confidence within the digital asset ecosystem. These legislative achievements reflect the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders and industry participants, including Riot Platforms, The Texas Blockchain Council and the Chamber of Digital Commerce according to Morgenstern.</p><p>In addition to these developments, public miner stocks also surged on the news that the U.S. debt ceiling deal may be finalized soon, and that it does not include President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">proposed 30% tax</a> on energy used for Bitcoin mining. </p><p>While these successes mark important milestones, advocates acknowledge that their work is far from over. But the Bitcoin community remains optimistic about the future and the continued growth of the industry, with the positive outcomes achieved in Texas during this legislative session setting a favorable precedent for Bitcoin-related policies and innovation in the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg1MDk0MzA2Njg2NjQxNDk3/img_7058.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paxful Announces Appointment Of Interim CEO Roshan Dharia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dharia will act as CEO as the exchange continues its transition from previous leadership under Ray Youssef.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paxful-announces-appointment-of-interim-ceo-roshan-dharia</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paxful-announces-appointment-of-interim-ceo-roshan-dharia</guid><category><![CDATA[peer to peer]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[CEO]]></category><category><![CDATA[Paxful]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchanges]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 20:12:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4MTEzNjMyOTkzNzQ4ODg1/img_0295.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="http://paxful.com/">Paxful</a>, a global peer-to-peer Bitcoin platform, has announced the appointment of Roshan Dharia as the new Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.

Just a month ago, The New York Times published a malicious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">article</a> on Bitcoin mining’s energy usage. Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has repeatedly attacked Bitcoin from a variety of angles, going so far as to launch an “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/14/elizabeth-warren-anti-crypto-ftx-00082624">anti-crypto army</a>” targeting Bitcoin as a hazard to consumers, all while misleading the public on the environmental impact of Bitcoin. </p><p>These verbal assaults are not isolated and the examples above represent only a small piece of the uphill climb Bitcoin has to mass adoption. To put it mildly, Bitcoin is disrupting countless industries, making centralized authorities fearful of losing their monopoly on money and the power that accompanies it. Bitcoin essentially “calls the bluff” on corrupt bureaucrats and infinitely-inflatable fiat currencies that further enrich those who own assets while eating away at the purchasing power of those living paycheck to paycheck. Because Bitcoin is location-agnostic and capable of utilizing flexible loads, it naturally increases demand for the cheapest energy sources, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-uses-mostly-sustainable-energy">which are often stranded natural gas or renewables</a>. </p><p>So, why do many elected officials and companies attempt to denigrate and work to outlaw Bitcoin mining? Likely because their egos prevent them from understanding the value proposition of Bitcoin, but the facts speak for themselves. </p><p>Alana Mediavilla is a wife, mother, entrepreneur, business owner, filmmaker and Bitcoiner. She has a hell of a resume and a passion for storytelling. Armed with her knowledge of Bitcoin and skillset, Mediavilla decided to film and produce the documentary “<a href="https://www.dirtycointhemovie.com/">Dirty Coin</a>,” which highlights the value of Bitcoin mining while simultaneously busting the theory that Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment. </p><p>It was a privilege to hear her story and I know you will find her passion for Bitcoin inspiring.</p><p><strong>What is your professional background?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I've been an artist and entrepreneur my whole life. Couldn't help it. Started my production company in Silicon Valley 11 years ago and got recruited to be a video producer at Google Cloud for almost five years while I moonlit still running my creative agency for other big tech folks. In 2021, I parted my full-time ways with Google to focus my efforts on my company and my own IP and films.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what categorically drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I learned about Bitcoin during my daughter's ballet class in Campbell, California. A friend of mine that also had his daughter in the same class told me to buy as much as I could waste on bitcoin that week. He told me it would go up, so I degened into Bitcoin. That got me paying attention to it and when my Cuban grandfather told me he knew people sending bitcoin to Cuba, I dug into what the heck Bitcoin really was. What I found out blew my mind and continues to do so to this day.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I make a feature documentary explaining my position to them XD.</p><p>It's understandable to be against Bitcoin. Crypto is a clown show and many don't see the difference between Bitcoin and shitcoins. Add to that that many people were raised with an energy scarcity mentality so having some crypto "hog all the energy" definitely sounds alarming. The issue is that this is just not the case. Is the industry perfect? Hell no! But are we scrutinizing the energy use of other industries the same way? Are we studied enough to know about the situations where having an energy-hungry industry like Bitcoin mining can be a good thing, as in the cases with flare mitigation or becoming a buyer of last resort in the middle of nowhere?</p><p>Understanding more factual information about the space can't help but create better conversations about Bitcoin.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone. Closing the gender gap is bringing diversity of users and advocates into Bitcoin. Women are particularly good at influencing their social circles and communities. More women in the Bitcoin space means more women advocating for Bitcoin in a grassroots way. We need all kinds of people to root for financial sovereignty and that starts with conversations around the dinner table that mothers are very often responsible for leading. Whether a woman is financially independent or supporting her partner who is taking on that responsibility for the family, women understanding the importance of Bitcoin means more support to other women, people in their community, and most importantly, their families.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

    </figure><p>It is set in a fictional world gripped by perpetual war between a sea-faring economic power and a population of monsters who appear to attack ships out of nowhere. The hunters, the heroes of the story, patrol the seas in a near-constant state of combat, fighting to keep trade routes open and safe. In exchange, they are paid after presenting proof of their monster kills to the monarchy. </p><p>It was a fairly overt critique of the military industrial complex, though the deeper theme that I saw was the toxic effects that the media propaganda complex has on a society, reducing peoples’ ability to exercise discernment, and obscuring objective truth. </p><h2>Learn History Or Repeat It</h2><p>I think the reason why “The Sea Beast”<em> </em>had such an impact on me is because at its core, it is a story of what can happen to society when truth becomes obscured by revisionist history and propaganda. In the end, it was up to individuals to exercise discernment, and break the societal trance that had been propagating violence for generations. In the end, the rulers only ever had power because the people had allowed them to.</p><p>American culture and history is rich with individualism and critical thought, such as the idea that taxation without representation is immoral. This ideal <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/no-taxation-without-representation">ultimately led to the Revolutionary War which founded this country</a>. But now, people are afraid to have real and engaging conversations, especially in public, because it might be considered “wrong think” or offensive, ultimately leading to the cancellation of their public lives and digital exile.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/midyreyes/status/1629917053808148486"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Bitcoin reinvigorates many things, but the most important I think is the discernment of truth.</p><p>Bitcoin is fundamentally an exercise in regaining your power of discernment. One must sift through a slew of propaganda and fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in order to learn the truth and see true value. The journey that one must take in order to truly understand Bitcoin necessitates discernment and critical thought. And once we reach a critical mass, the intransigent minority becomes entrenched in the culture.</p><p>Furthermore, once you are able to store your hard-earned wealth in a self-sovereign way, the courage to speak freely becomes self evident. No more are the worries of cancellation and debanking. The changes in time preference as well will likely increase your savings rate, making people more financially stable and less fearful of leaving or losing a job that may be holding them back. </p><h2>‘You Can Be A Hero But Still Be Wrong.’</h2><p>I know that many Bitcoiners criticize the military and governments especially. They detest war in all its forms and hope to bring about the end of it with the dawn of a new, hard-money standard. This is, of course, a worthy goal. But I must urge Bitcoiners to separate the service members from the policy decisions they are charged with executing. </p><p>According to analysis from Jordan Peterson that I have seen, one of the main reasons individuals join the military is the desire to find meaning and purpose in life. Peterson argues that young men often lack a clear sense of direction and purpose, and the structure and discipline of military life can provide them with a sense of belonging and fulfillment. Additionally, the military can offer opportunities for personal growth, challenge and adventure, as well as providing a sense of pride and accomplishment.</p><p>Many have died in the pursuit, hence the day of remembrance that we celebrate on Memorial Day. And yet, some much-needed criticism has been quashed in the name of the troops. </p><p>The line, “You can be a hero and still be wrong” from “The Sea Beast” was especially striking in this context. Without the ability to see objective facts, it is difficult to ascertain objective truth. Discernment is a skill, a skill that has atrophied drastically throughout society in the passing years. It is perhaps one of the reasons why cries for the government to protect us have grown so loud.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/mindingottawa/status/1629959701227077633"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>There is no truth without debate and disagreement, characterizations of which have been elevated from being uncomfortable to becoming outright unsafe. And yet, creeping protectionism has its costs as well; the slow erosion of freedoms that we may never get back. The very freedoms that many service members have died to protect, the very service members who we are charged with remembering on Memorial Day. </p><p>If we are to remember and honor those sacrifices, perhaps the best way to do so in the current age is to exercise our discernment. Critical thinking is a skill that can be learned, or relearned in certain cases. Bitcoin helps those seeking to regain responsibility in their lives, and yes, exercise some critical thinking in order to discern fact from fiction, propaganda from news. </p><p>Bitcoin reinvigorates critical thought, critical thought leads to truth. Some have the humility to accept it. Others have to be slapped across the face with it, ultimately experiencing the pain of ego death. Truth is the only way to honor the fallen. Have the courage to choose truth, and live not by lies. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

Suddenly, a crisis hits. This could be the rise of an autocratic regime, a democide or an armed conflict. Whatever the circumstances, you will most likely have two pressing problems on your mind. First and foremost, you need to get everyone to safety, preferably abroad. Second, you need to preserve as much of your savings as possible to set up your life elsewhere. Since a safe escape from a disaster-stricken country depends heavily on individual circumstances, this article will focus on a savings preservation strategy that is globally applicable.</p><h2>Preserving Your Savings The Traditional Way</h2><p>Protecting the value of one’s savings while fleeing a country has never been easy. Those fortunate enough to have had any wealth before a crisis strikes may find it difficult to save it when there is a sudden need to leave the country.</p><h3>Real Estate</h3><p>So, you own your house, and chances are that you have benefited greatly from the easy money policies of the past decade as it has grown a lot in value over the years. You may be moderately well off on paper, but how easy is it to actually turn your house into money in a short time frame? The market demand might be heavily impacted by the very crisis that is forcing you to flee — for example in a case of foreign invasion, the demand for houses in the affected region will come to a halt, while the number of homeowners looking to sell will skyrocket. So, unless you foresaw a crisis looming ahead and sold before others, chances are you won’t be able to extract much of your home’s value when you need it the most.</p><h3>Savings In The Bank</h3><p>But let’s say you had good foresight and sold your house in time. Now you have a lot of money in the bank. Again, if the crisis affects the entire country, chances are you won't be able to withdraw or move your money fast enough. There are many examples in history where a "bank holiday" was announced and depositors were denied their money when they needed it the most. One of the more recent examples comes from Lebanon, where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-services-lebanon-business-8ca0f73931d60e36c1dd7d40e77c25de">banks simply shut their doors and ATMs</a> to prevent clients from withdrawing their money in the midst of an ongoing economic crisis. If you think you can protect yourself against a national currency’s devaluation by owning a dollar account, you better think twice: In Lebanon, the dollar accounts were forcefully converted to a Lebanese pound that had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-services-lebanon-business-8ca0f73931d60e36c1dd7d40e77c25de">lost 97% of its value against the dollar since 2019</a>. In fact, bank accounts may not be safe anywhere, as banks around the world operate in fractional-reserve mode, making them vulnerable to runs and subsequent collapses. Recent collapses of a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/17/regulators-shut-down-banks-raising-questions-about-neutrality/?sh=ddc2b5b71853">trio of U.S. banks</a> — Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank — have proven this vulnerability.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that there is usually a several days’ delay between an emerging crisis and a full-blown bank holiday. If you suspect that banks might prohibit you from accessing your money soon, you can use this window of opportunity to withdraw your money in the form of cash or quickly convert it into bitcoin while it's still possible.</p><h3>Cash</h3><p>Let’s say you withdrew all of your money and kept it in cash. Hopefully, it’s in dollars or euros, as otherwise it might be hard to find a use for your local currency abroad, especially if the crisis that forced you to leave impacts the exchange rate, as it often does — the Ukrainian hryvnia<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ukraines-central-bank-devalues-hryvnia-by-25-against-us-dollar-2022-07-21/"> has devalued by 25%</a> since the start of the Russian invasion. </p><p>Traveling with large amounts of dollars or euros also involves risks, though. The first of those is a risk of theft, either by common criminals or corrupt border patrols. The second risk is that, if you’re traveling with cash worth more than $10,000 or the equivalent in euros, you need to declare them when crossing the borders of many countries, <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-195?language=en_US">including the U.S.</a> Failure to declare can result in the confiscation of the full amount. </p><p>Did you know that the U.S. customs guards confiscate more than $200,000 from travelers <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/dulles-cbp-officers-seize-over-350k-during-14-currency-reporting">on average every day</a>? And if you do in fact declare that you’re traveling with large amounts of cash, you never know where that information might end up — sensitive data that is collected can also leak. For example, in 2020, there was <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/03/us-property-records-database.html">a major leak of detailed personal data</a>, including the property records of 200 million Americans. Criminals can use this data for targeted attacks.</p><p>Cash is also getting gradually useless in the western world. In the euro area, cash usage <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.pr221220~62a7c988ef.en.html">fell</a> from accounting for 72% of all point-of-sale transactions in 2019 to 59% in 2022, and this trend is encouraged by governments that impose strict cash limits. So, even if you make it abroad with your savings in the form of cash, you’ll likely need to set up a bank account fast, which might not be a straightforward or easy task for a new migrant.</p><h3>Gold</h3><p>Gold used to be the most popular way to transfer value intact in the past, given that it has a worldwide demand and can be sold at relatively little discount (assuming investment-grade coins or bars are being used). Gold is also quite dense in value, as the price of 1 kilogram of gold is <a href="https://www.chards.co.uk/gold-price/weekly-gold-price-usd-per-kilo">around $60,000 at the time of this writing</a>. Otherwise, it faces the same risks as cash as it can be easily stolen along the way. Moreover, gold isn’t accepted as a means of payment and isn’t divisible, so you’d need to exchange your full coins or bars into the local currency after you arrive in your destination country.</p><h3>Stocks And Bonds</h3><p>Stocks and bonds are great fair-weather instruments, but they might become as useless as bank accounts when things get hairy. Local stocks and bonds will likely be worthless abroad and their value might be impacted by the given crisis. International financial instruments (e.g., U.S.-based exchange-traded funds) would fare better, though such instruments aren’t available in most parts of the world. And even if they are available to you, access to these instruments may be affected by newly-imposed sanctions.</p><h2>Does Bitcoin Fix This?</h2><p>You might have noticed that all of the usual instruments for wealth preservation have common traits in the form of limited transferability and/or value tied to a specific location or jurisdiction. Physical instruments such as cash and gold always carry a risk of loss or theft along the way, while intangible instruments such as real estate, bank accounts and stocks are, for the most part, valuable only locally.</p><p>Bitcoin indeed fixes this.</p><p>First, bitcoin is intangible and is therefore very easy to transfer. You can either send bitcoin to anyone globally within minutes, or you can remember the recovery seed and literally carry the bitcoin in your head (though that carries its specific risks as well, as we’ll cover below). Compared to other intangible assets, such as bank or brokerage accounts, there is no counterparty risk — you never need to worry about your money becoming inaccessible due to bank holidays, institutional failures or newly-imposed sanctions.</p><p>Second, bitcoin is a global asset, and as such, its value isn’t linked to any specific jurisdiction. A good example of this fact is the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/latest-china-ban-impacting-bitcoin">2021 bitcoin mining ban in China</a>, which seemed like a big deal at the time, since most bitcoin mining operations were located in China. Nevertheless, bitcoin miners simply moved elsewhere, and there was virtually no impact on the price (on the contrary, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-china-ban-improved-bitcoin-in-2021">bitcoin reached new highs several months after the ban</a>). Bitcoin is a global asset, but unlike gold, it can be bought or sold in all kinds of ways — on regulated exchanges, on decentralized exchanges, in ATMs, or from person to person; and the chances are, you will face a minimum spread on your exchanges.</p><p>Bitcoin’s intangibility, zero reliance on third parties and global liquidity makes it a perfect candidate for savings preservation in critical situations.</p><p>So, what are the specific methods for using bitcoin when fleeing a country?</p><h2>Traveling With Bitcoin Safely</h2><p>The main concern when traveling with bitcoin is to eliminate a single point of failure. If you just write down your recovery seed and put it in your back pocket, you undertake a great risk, as anyone who sees, takes or photographs your recovery seed has the ability to steal all your bitcoin. To travel safely with bitcoin, you need to minimize the possibility of loss or theft. Below are some tips on how to tackle this problem.</p><h3>Bitcoin In Your Mind</h3><p>To keep access to your bitcoin, the only thing you need to do is remember your recovery seed i.e., an ordered list of English words that is either 12- or 24-words long. Remembering 12 words is obviously easier than remembering 24 words, so it’s advisable to go for that option (e.g., by generating your seed on a Trezor Model T, which supports this format). Use a memory-enhancement technique such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">memory palace</a>. If you’re traveling with your family, have all the family members remember the same recovery seed; that way, if someone forgets some of the words, you’ll still be able to reconstruct the full seed.</p><p>After you memorize your seed, try recovering your bitcoin in an offline wallet, preferably a hardware device (on Trezor devices, you can perform a<a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/test-recovery-seed-on-model-t"> dry run recovery</a> that doesn’t wipe the device). Once you’re certain you have your recovery seed firmly embedded in your memory, wipe the wallet. If you want to carry your hardware wallet with you on your travels, make sure it is wiped, so that if you lose it or someone takes it away from you, there will be no possibility of its misuse.</p><p>On arrival, recover your bitcoin again in the wallet of your choice (make sure you type in your seed in an offline environment though!).</p><p>Don’t rely on your memory for longer periods. Traveling in an adversarial environment is the only situation when relying on your memory might be a good idea, but aim to minimize the time span in which you store your recovery seed in your head. For long-term storage, always write your seed down, or better yet, stamp or engrave it into steel (there are many products for this on the market; before you make a purchase, I recommend checking out <a href="https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/">Jameson Lopp’s stress tests</a>).</p><h3>Relying On Your Web Of Trust</h3><p>Another way to transfer your wealth via bitcoin is to simply send it as a bitcoin transaction to someone you trust. The person doesn’t even have to be in the country you aim to travel to; the important thing is that they will be able to keep your bitcoin safe during your travels, and send it back to you when you’re able to set up your new wallet in a safe environment. The most important factor here is trust. This may be off-putting to some (after all, we all know the mantra of “don’t trust, verify”), but the fact is that for some people this may be the way to go if they don’t want to rely on their memory and are certain that the person on the other side would never betray them. The person you’re sending your bitcoin to needs to be proficient in bitcoin, and ideally should own a well backed-up hardware wallet — after all, you don’t want them to hold your life savings on their mobile phones, right?</p><p>If you want to increase the security of this process, you can do so via a multisig wallet. Let’s say you set up a two-out-of-three multisig wallet and transfer your bitcoin into such a wallet. Now you can send one of the keys to Person A, the second one to Person B and carry the third one with you. Person A and Person B shouldn’t know about each other, so that there is no way to steal the bitcoin that is stored in this way. And if you lose your key during your travels, you will still be able to recover your bitcoin using the keys of Person A and Person B. You can set up your multisig wallet using Electrum, Sparrow or Nunchuk. To distribute the keys, make sure to use a secure, encrypted communicator such as <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318911-How-do-I-know-my-communication-is-private-#:~:text=Signal%20messages%20and%20calls%20cannot,encrypted%2C%20private%2C%20and%20secure.">Signal</a> messenger (do not use Telegram, as it <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/telegram-why-nobody-uses-secret-chats/27662/#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Telegram%20chats%20do,about%20the%20secure%20chat%20option.">isn’t encrypted by default!</a>).</p><p>Alternatively, you can utilize a Shamir backup, a cryptographically-sound method for splitting your recovery seed into multiple shares (use time-tested wallets such as the Trezor Model T to do this safely). Let’s say you do a two-out-of-three Shamir backup — the next steps are the same as we described above with multisigs. It’s advisable to reinforce the security of your Shamir backup by setting up a <a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/passphrases-and-hidden-wallets">passphrase</a> on top of it.</p><h3>Plausible Deniability</h3><p>Ideally, there should be no indication that you are a Bitcoiner. That means carrying no hardware wallets, having no Bitcoin stickers on your laptop or phone, not carrying any Bitcoin books and deleting any Bitcoin/cryptocurrency apps from your phone. Do not talk about bitcoin with strangers or the border guards. If someone asks a seemingly-innocent question about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, act ignorant or just say that you think it’s a scam. Simply said, you should look and act as a “normie.”</p><h3>Do Not Rely On Exchanges</h3><p>Some readers might be tempted to use their bitcoin exchange account — after all, you can log into it from anywhere in the world, right? I personally strongly advise against relying on exchanges with any portion of your savings. Aside from frequent exchange failures (just in the last twelve months, we saw the collapses of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, and a <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/gemini-earn-users-lose-savings">freeze on Gemini Earn users</a>), the exchange may block your funds, for example, because of sanctions or logging in from an IP address in a "wrong" country. In short, if you hold your bitcoin on an exchange, you don't really own it.</p><h2>Not Just A Theory Anymore</h2><p>Bitcoin is already used as a means of preserving one's savings in times of crisis. In recent years, we have seen success stories of this kind from countries as diverse as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-financial-freedom-in-afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html"> Venezuela</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html">Ukraine</a>. Due to its global liquidity and direct controllability, bitcoin is proving to be a valuable tool in critical situations. The more knowledgeable you are about the safe transfer of bitcoin, the better prepared you'll be in the event of such a situation arising.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Josef Tětek.

It should be noted that no investor worth their salt would tell you to put your life savings into crypto, but there is plenty of upside potential for those looking to make long-term returns or preserve a portion of their wealth this way.</p><p>Let me just mention a few of these advantages that make this investment in bitcoin worth looking more deeply into:</p><ul><li>Alternative store of value: Bitcoin is as good as it gets when looking for a store of value outside of third-party manipulation. Being decentralized means that it circumvents many of the red-tape aspects and fees that come with leaving your money in the hands of financial institutions. As a result, it is not subject to the same inflationary pressures that are so prevalent with companies operating in the government-controlled fiat currency system.</li><li>Potential for long-term growth: There is no doubt that bitcoin's value is extremely volatile in the short term, but its long-term trend has historically been a fairly bullish affair. The idea of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp">HODLing</a> comes into play here, as you will really only be able to see the true value of your investment when ignoring the spikes and holding on for dear life.</li><li>Diversification: As I said before, investing in bitcoin does not mean that you dump all of your hard-earned eggs into the chaotic basket that is crypto, but you can provide some much-needed, future-oriented diversification for your investment portfolio. As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/30/bitcoins-correlation-with-stocks-is-at-its-lowest-since-2021-as-investors-grapple-with-the-cryptocurrencys-narrative-shift.html">bitcoin's price is increasingly uncorrelated to those of traditional assets</a>, such as stocks and bonds, adding some of these digital coins to your portfolio can help spread out the overall risks that your investments might face from the old guard. In fact, what we have seen over the past few years is that bitcoin has become a new sort of semi-safe-haven asset class which many investors flock to the moment that old-school investment vehicles and fiat currencies come under pressure.</li><li>Accessibility: This goes down two lanes. On the one side, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/02/14/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin-for-beginners/?sh=25ed62097697">investing in bitcoin is becoming easier to do</a>, with many platforms and exchanges now offering a simple and secure way to buy and hold your BTC; while at the same time, it has never been easier to liquidate this asset and get fiat cash in hand when the need arises. This scores a massive point over the stock, bond or real estate markets, which are forever plagued by liquidity issues; especially in times of large-scale financial instability.</li></ul><p>In the long run, spending a share of your income on BTC is unlikely to make you poor. On the flip side, not allocating anything to BTC might ruin your prosperity, especially in these uncertain times when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-caused-silicon-valley-banks-failure-2023-03-10/">banks can go bust without warning</a>,<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/09/09/cotw-how-food-and-energy-are-driving-the-global-inflation-surge"> inflation seems to be ever on the rise</a> and several countries <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin">witness their fiat currencies turn into toilet paper.</a></p><h2>Why I Don’t Buy Or Mine BTC</h2><p>In the pursuit of acquiring bitcoin, there are always the obvious channels of hitting up some form of cryptocurrency exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace and just exchanging fiat for BTC. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, and it might be the easiest and perhaps the only option for many people out there, it is, in my humble opinion, not the best way to get your coins for wealth preservation. </p><p>You could instead go the route of the miner and spend a large fortune on buying all the equipment needed to try and get some BTC that way, but in this day and age with the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/the-cost-of-mining-bitcoin-in-198-different-countries/">average mining cost per coin being over $30,000 in many countries</a>, it is more likely that you will end up with zilch long before you ever mine your first coin.</p><p>So, what would I suggest? Earn it.</p><p>Sure, not everyone can convince their boss to pay them in bitcoin, but these days, many people have a side hustle that can easily be employed in generating some digital dosh. Five years ago, offering your clients the ability to pay in crypto for your services was a nonexistent concept, but <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1290483/crypto-payment-acceptance-by-industry/">today, it is a no-brainer</a>. Right now, a large number of my clients, especially those operating in the online world, are really into paying for services via crypto. While most of them like to use stablecoins such as USDT, you can easily flip these over to BTC and keep padding your Bitcoin wallet.</p><p>One more notable online activity that I partake in to stack some BTC is for the over-18-year-olds only. No, I don’t mean OnlyFans. I do some work in and around the gambling industry and also enjoy a bit of a gamble myself from time to time, but I solely gamble for BTC. </p><p><a href="https://cryptobetting.net/online-gambling-industry-growth-infographic/">Bitcoin betting sites have been gaining traction lately</a>, thanks to their ability to protect privacy, offer deals (e.g., bonuses, commissions, etc.) and general improvements over the annoying bureaucracy inherent in fiat betting sites. Obviously, I don't recommend gambling to anyone, but this is something I enjoy occasionally, such as when my favorite UFC fighter jumps into the octagon, as it adds a bit of excitement while watching the fights, and obviously, the winnings are added to my wealth-preservation BTC fund. </p><h2>My BTC Wealth Preservation Strategy</h2><p>You might be wondering why I am hammering on bitcoin and not paying much heed to the rest of the crypto pack. Frankly, as <a href="https://www.cityam.com/price-of-bitcoin-slips-as-other-cryptocurrencies-follow-suit/">most of the top tokens are following the bitcoin price like a donkey chasing a carrot</a>, I don’t typically diversify things or allocate a share of my crypto investments into other major coins and tokens. Don’t get me wrong, I believe that some of the cryptocurrencies out there are useful, but, as bitcoin is what determines the value of many of the top dogs on the list, sticking with BTC as my investment coin just makes sense. (For those keen on diversifying into other crypto projects, I do have one bit of advice; stay away from meme and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp">shitcoins</a>.) </p><p>Now, let’s get down to business. Here is my advice for preserving wealth via bitcoin based on my own strategy:</p><ul><li>Plan: Whether you are investing with fiat currencies that you get from working a day job or getting paid directly in crypto via your own projects, make sure to have a well-defined goal. Set certain annual or even quarterly amounts that you would like to reach and try your best to make it happen. </li><li>Don't panic: Always work on increasing your BTC holdings and be ready to HODL until kingdom comes. Don't pay much attention to the fiat value and don't panic sell just because you see some of those crazy price swings that bitcoin is so famous for. It is all good and well to compare exchanges and cryptocurrencies, but do not sit there stressing about where the price of BTC is sitting. Short-term dips are bound to come and go, but if you believe in BTC as much as I do, then you can rest assured that your wealth is being preserved. Keep in mind that there are only 21M BTC available, ever. As this is a finite supply and the <a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/world">world's population is close to eight billion</a>, with more people being added every day, the value of this asset is sure to increase over time as more governments and people take hold of this new shift in finance. If and when fiat finally goes completely bust and bitcoin takes over as the major currency, an average BTC per capita in the world is going to be around 0.0025, and you most certainly want to be in the top 5% of those holding it.</li><li>Keep it secure: Bitcoin is digital, and hackers are always on the lookout for those who are not keeping a watchful eye on their money. So, to preserve my wealth safely, I keep all of my bitcoin holdings in hardware wallets stashed in a safe place. There are plenty of good exchanges and hot wallets to choose from, but if you are serious about preserving your wealth, keep it cold, keep it offline.</li></ul><h2>Why You Shouldn’t Wait To Diversify</h2><p>Allocating a portion of your wealth to bitcoin can be an effective way to preserve it, and even grow it, but as the saying goes, “the best time to start is yesterday, the second best time is now.” </p><p>Don’t wait for <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/23/bitcoin-to-rally-past-50000-due-to-halving-process-say-crypto-analysts/">BTC to hit $50,000</a> before you suddenly wake up and start buying in. Set up a plan today and start diversifying your portfolio in this future-proof asset class, so you know your wealth is safe, no matter how bad your government might be.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Konstantin Riban.

Quickly amassing over 9,000,000 inscriptions, the new protocol allows for arbitrary data to be embedded on the Bitcoin blockchain. In addition to attracting attention from the NFT industry, Ordinals have led to a major increase in the fees required to send bitcoin, eliciting new debate on how Bitcoin should deal with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">high fee environments</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, <a href="https://twitter.com/farokh">Farokh</a>, founder of the Rug Radio platform and a well-known collector within the NFT industry, shared insights into the world of Bitcoin NFTs and his vision for the Bitcoin inscription market’s future. Reflecting on his own Bitcoin and NFT journey, Farokh acknowledged the initial confusion surrounding Bitcoin in 2012, given the lack of development and user-friendly platforms at the time. However, he highlighted the rapid growth and development of NFT platforms in 2021, and how that is reflected now in the context of Bitcoin NFTs’ sudden rise in popularity.</p><p>When discussing the advantages of Ordinals, Farokh emphasized the security aspect of storing art on the Bitcoin blockchain, stating, "Ordinals now enable art to be stored on the most secure blockchain in the world, without keeping this data in external databases where it can be vulnerable to manipulation." He identified this as the biggest benefit of Ordinals over NFTs on other, less secure blockchains, recognizing the need for censorship-resistant and immutable storage solutions.</p><p>Regarding the future of Bitcoin NFTs, Farokh expressed his optimism. He also acknowledged the current challenges, such as high costs and the need for infrastructure development, but believed that with the continuous growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, improved solutions would emerge.</p><p>Farokh also discussed the entry of luxury brands into the Bitcoin NFT space, mentioning the collaboration between <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bugatti-and-asprey-announce-bitcoin-inscriptions">Asprey and Bugatti</a>. He expressed his curiosity about high-end brands embracing ordinals and leveraging the security and authenticity provided by the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>When asked about the reaction of projects transitioning to Bitcoin NFTs, Farokh noted the generally positive response. He drew parallels to the early days of NFTs, where skepticism was common but ultimately proven wrong. He also highlighted the positive reception of projects like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/yuga-labs-introduces-first-bitcoin-ordinals-collection">Yuga Labs’ TwelveFold</a>, indicating that the acceptance of Bitcoin NFTs was gradually gaining momentum.</p><p>Looking ahead, Farokh envisioned a mature Bitcoin NFT market with user-friendly platforms accessible to retail users. He remarked, "Look how much the [NFT] marketplace has evolved ... at first, it was complicated to make a wallet. Now we have proper marketplaces." Farokh's optimistic outlook suggested a future where the Bitcoin NFT market becomes more mainstream and user-friendly, ultimately driving further adoption.</p><p>Overall, Farokh's interview shed light on the growing importance of Bitcoin NFTs, their unique advantages and the evolving landscape of the Ordinals protocol.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core Version 25.0 Released Bringing New Features And Transaction Use Cases]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core users should be sure to read through the release notes before updating their software to the latest release version.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-core-version-25-0-released</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-core-version-25-0-released</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin core]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Updates]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 16:22:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNTQ5MTIz/technical-bitcoin-development-pixel.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin Core version 25.0 has been released, bringing new features, bug fixes and performance improvements to the software. Users can download the latest version from the official <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/">Bitcoin Core</a> website or update their existing installations. The release notes outline the changes and provide instructions on how to upgrade.</p><p>One notable change is the allowance of transactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above, which opens up new use cases and enhances protections against vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-12842. Another addition is the scanblocks RPC, which allows for fast wallet rescans by returning relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors.</p><p>In terms of RPC updates, all JSON-RPC methods now accept a new named parameter called "args" for passing positional parameter values conveniently. Additionally, the verifychain RPC will now return false if checks couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level, providing more accurate feedback.</p><p>The release also includes changes to the build system, updated settings and new features. For instance, the shutdownnotify option allows users to specify a command to execute before Bitcoin Core begins its shutdown sequence. In the wallet section, new options like minconf and maxconf have been added to various RPCs, providing greater control over UTXO confirmations.</p><p>Bitcoin Core 25.0 introduces several improvements and optimizations, enhancing the user experience and security of the software. As with any release, users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter to the official GitHub issue tracker.</p><p>Bitcoin Core is widely supported and tested on major operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows.

    </figure><p>Congressman Brad Sherman's recent tweet attacking Bitcoiners as "tax evaders" is a prime example of how Bitcoin has become a mainstream phenomenon. It's ironic that politicians like Sherman, who have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and the presumption of innocence, are so quick to label Bitcoin supporters as criminals without any evidence. Such remarks undermine the fundamental principles of justice and fairness that underpin our legal system. </p><p>The fact that politicians like Sherman are attacking Bitcoin serves as a signal to those on the fence that there may be something to this "freedom money" that is constantly under attack by those who are corrupt and compromised by legacy systems. In a way, even those who attack Bitcoin may be unwittingly working for its success and adoption.</p><p>And clearly, politicians are expecting Bitcoiners to shoulder some kind of tax burden that they do not impose on anyone else.</p><p>Imagine if a politician tried to tax people for using computational power to do math or use English to express their views. They would be ridiculed and mocked because, on top of that being an insane policy, both of these subjects are essential to a functional society. </p><p>Instead of imposing arbitrary taxes, the government should focus on creating a regulatory environment that supports innovation and economic growth. Unfortunately, in opposition to that seemingly-obvious edict, the Biden administration <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">has proposed a 30% tax on Bitcoin mining</a>, which is not only unfair, but also hypocritical to the values that make the United States great. </p><p>If a market participant has paid for their energy, they should be free to use it as they wish. So, why is Bitcoin mining being targeted when other industries, such as pornography, video games or gambling, also use energy to allow people to indulge in their vices online? I’m not vying for a tax on other industries. I firmly believe that if a market participant has paid for their energy they can do whatever they want with it. My intent is to point out that this proposal seems to be a clear example of government overreach and intervention in the private sector. </p><h2>Reacting To Change</h2><p>And it's not just Bitcoin mining that is being targeted. It is the entire Bitcoin network. When new and innovative ideas challenge the status quo, both humans and technology can exhibit resistance or embrace the change. Technology mimics many things about human biology, including the way we respond to change. Established industries or entities may resist new technologies to protect their own interests, just like how our immune system responds to foreign pathogens to protect our body. However, just as humans can adapt to changing environments, technology can also evolve and adapt to better serve our needs. People can either fight against Bitcoin or embrace it, but either way, this technology is changing the world rapidly.</p><p>It's important to remember that new technology, including Bitcoin, is not inherently bad, but rather a tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes. Instead of fighting against progress, we should embrace the opportunities that new technology provides and work together to shape a better future. Sherman's tweet may not win him any votes, but it shows his lack of understanding and respect for the rights of his constituents.</p><p>The comparison between a technology network and human biology may seem unconventional, but it provides valuable insights into the evolution and growth of new technologies like Bitcoin. Kevin Kelly’s book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Technology_Wants">What Technology Wants</a>” highlights the importance of this. There are three quotes that really stood out to me:</p><blockquote><p>“Technologies do not exist in isolation, but rather in networks that amplify their power and reach.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Innovation is a team sport, and the best innovations are produced by networks of people working together.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The more interconnected our technologies become, the more emergent properties they exhibit, and the harder they are to predict or control.”</p></blockquote><p>Technology is always evolving based on human needs. It starts with a small idea and then grows into something larger than anyone could have imagined. This evolution is not always linear, as new technologies often emerge from existing technologies. These networks grow exponentially faster as new technologies enable stuff we never thought possible. FaceTime would seem magical to someone 100 years ago in the same way that a medical device that can regenerate limbs for people would seem magical in the modern day. I assume that type of technology will come someday and with it many more innovations that I could never have hoped to imagine until I saw them.</p><p>But, just like humans, technology has its own set of rules and laws. We have to follow these rules to make the most out of technology’s potential. Imagine if someone called a conference about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a> a “conference for gang members.” It would seem ridiculous. Especially from a politician who should be encouraging innovation in their district. </p><p>Attacking people because they enjoy using a protocol is insane. However, if your job was dedicated to maintaining legacy technology and adopting new technology could make you irrelevant, I suppose you wouldn't react favorably toward the new technology either.</p><h2>Embracing The Evolution Of Technology</h2><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MTczOTE3Njk1NzgwMDMw/college-tuition-prices-rising.png" height="587" width="620">

    </figure><p>In the end, we are all part of the network of technology, whether we like it or not. We must embrace the evolution of technology, and understand its potential to shape the world for the better. We are at the beginning of all the things that will be built on these new protocols, so it is up to us to harness their power and make the most out of their potential. </p><p>I can’t say I know for a fact that bitcoin is going well above $1 million, but I think it’s pretty damn possible and that, as more network effects get added, both in meatspace and cyberspace, the more likely it becomes.</p><blockquote><p>“When zero reached Europe roughly 300 years later in the High Middle Ages, it was met with strong ideological resistance. Facing opposition from users of the well-established Roman numeral system, zero struggled to gain ground in Europe.”&nbsp;</p><p>–Robert Breedlove, “<a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b">The Number Zero And Bitcoin</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Now, the idea of not using zero in math is a non-starter. It seems highly likely Bitcoin will have a similar fate as zero and the idea of not using Bitcoin and all the things built on top of it will be preposterous. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/nostr-and-bitcoin-can-change-social-media">Just look at Nostr, for an example</a>. There is no way the protocol would have thrived had it not been for both Bitcoin and Bitcoiners bringing so much value onto the network.</p><p>I believe a similar effect will take place for more innovations around the world, whether regulators understand Bitcoin or not.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Conor Chepenik.
