Speaking in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto-friendly banks in the U.S. and amid Binance’s issues with payment providers in Australia, Changpeng Zhao said investments in several banks might be a better option although not a guarantee that crypto won’t be cut off.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Founder CZ Responds to Call to Buy a Bank, Says He Doesn’t Like Running Businesses With Debt</h2>
<p>Binance has looked into the potential acquisition of a traditional bank but found that’s not an ultimate solution to its own and the crypto industry’s issues with banking. Changpeng Zhao (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZ</a>), the exchange’s founder and chief executive, commented on the matter on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Bankless/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bankless</a> podcast this week.</p>
<p>“You buy one bank, it only works in one country, and you still have to deal with the bank regulators of that country,” the crypto entrepreneur said, answering a question from Twitter user @DegenSpartan, who asked him: “Can you please, buy a bank and make it crypto-friendly?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t mean you buy a bank and you can do whatever you want to do. If the banking regulators say ‘You can’t work with crypto,’ they are going to take your license away if you do. So buying a bank doesn’t prevent the regulators telling you ‘No, you can’t touch crypto’,” he elaborated.</p>

<p>CZ’s statements come after the collapses of crypto-friendly institutions Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate in the U.S. earlier this year. They also coincide with Binance’s latest problems with Australian payment service providers deciding to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-australia-users-selling-bitcoin-at-discount-ahead-of-aud-withdrawals-halt/">quit</a> processing deposits and withdrawals in local currency for its customers.</p>
<p>Changpeng Zhao also pointed out that as banks operate in one jurisdiction, they still need corresponding banks to work globally, all of which are in the United States. They “will tell your bank ‘Look, if you touch crypto, we are not facilitating your international transactions’,” he explained.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R1mKwAxwAJ0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>“And then you have to get banking in every country, basically. And banks are not cheap. Banks are very expensive — for very little business, very little revenue … So it’s not just like because you have money, you can buy a whole lot of banks,” the crypto executive said.</p>
<p>CZ further highlighted that many banks don’t have very sound business models and are very risky businesses. “They take customer money, they loan it out. If they don’t get it back, they declare bankruptcy,” he elaborated. While recognizing that many governments would save troubled banks, he emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t like to run those kinds of businesses. I like to run businesses with no debt.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CEO of Binance suggested that his company may make small investments in a few banks, instead of buying one, with the hope that they become more crypto-friendly when they have the exchange as a minority investor. However, he admitted that this “doesn’t guarantee they will never cut crypto off.”</p>

Ruto said the Pan-African Payments and Settlement System (PAPSS) allows business people to focus on moving goods and services. </strong></p>
<h2>Pan-African Settlement System to Help African Countries Bypass U.S. Dollar</h2>
<p>Kenyan President William Ruto has called on fellow African leaders to start taking steps aimed at replacing the U.S. dollar with an alternative payment solution known as the Pan-African Payments and Settlement System (PAPSS). According to Ruto, this alternative settlement system, which was launched in Jan. 2022, allows African countries to use their respective currencies when trading among themselves.</p>
<p>The Kenyan leader, who spoke at a forum of government and private sector officials, suggested that African countries can commence the process of ditching the dollar by encouraging central banks and commercial banks to join PAPSS.</p>
<p>As explained in an East African <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/-kenya-revives-push-by-african-nations-to-ditch-the-dollar--4251528">report</a>, the alternative payment system, which is backed by central banks on the African continent, was developed by African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA) Secretariat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Explaining why African countries must abandon the dollar, the Kenyan leader reportedly said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are all struggling to make payments for goods and services from one country to another because of differences in currencies. And in the middle of all these, we are all subjected to a dollar environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ruto, however, suggested that when the settlement system is in play, business people’s only concern should be how to move goods and services. According to the Kenyan president, the &#8220;arduous task of currencies&#8221; will be left to Afreximbank, a pan-African multilateral trade finance institution.</p>

<h2>Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act</h2>
<p>U.S. Congressman Alex Mooney (R-WV) announced last week that he has introduced the Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act (H.R. 3712) &#8220;to close the Federal Reserve’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program loophole.&#8221; The lawmaker clarified:</p>
<blockquote><p>Specifically, this bill would prohibit the Federal Reserve from establishing, carrying out, or approving a program intended to test the practicability of issuing a CBDC.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bill is co-sponsored by 14 House Republicans: Pete Sessions, Bill Posey, Ralph Norman, Byron Donalds, John Rose, Andy Ogles, Jeff Duncan, Greg Steube, Randy Weber, Glenn Grothman, Ronny Jackson, Victoria Spartz, Harriet Hageman, and Bob Good.</p>
<p>“Congress cannot give an inch when it comes to CBDCs,” Rep. Mooney stressed, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>CBDCs would threaten the liberties of law-abiding Americans and are being used by authoritarian countries right now to crack down on dissent.</p></blockquote>
<p>“That’s why closing this pilot program loophole is so important — to prevent the Federal Reserve from bypassing the will of Congress,” he noted.</p>

<p>Multiple people have warned that central bank digital currencies pose major privacy and government surveillance concerns. “The Federal Reserve caught attention late last year for its CBDC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-fed-and-9-major-banks-to-test-interoperable-network-of-central-bank-wholesale-digital-money/">pilot projects</a>, even contracting with the private sector to build potential CBDCs for the United States which went beyond traditional research,” the congressman noted.</p>
<p>Several CBDC-related bills have been launched in Congress, including U.S. Senator Ted Cruz&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-introduces-no-digital-dollar-act-to-prohibit-treasury-and-the-fed-from-interfering-with-americans-using-paper-currency/">No Digital Dollar Act</a>&#8221; and Congressman Tom Emmer&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-launches-cbdc-anti-surveillance-state-act-to-protect-americans-right-to-financial-privacy/">CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</a>.&#8221; A number of states have also pushed against the Fed launching a digital dollar. For example, Florida Governor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/">Ron DeSantis</a> signed legislation in March that bans the use of a CBDC in his state.</p>
<p>However, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-provides-update-on-us-central-bank-digital-currency/">revealed</a> in March that the Fed is not &#8220;at the stage of making any real decisions,&#8221; noting that the central bank is &#8220;experimenting in kind of early-stage experimentation.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Central Banks&#8217; Confidence in US Dollar Drops</h2>
<p>The World Gold Council (WGC) published the results of its 2023 Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Following a historical high level of central bank gold buying, gold continues to be viewed favorably by central banks,” the gold industry body described, adding that 24% of central banks surveyed intend to increase their gold reserves holdings in the next 12 months. Last year, central banks bought a record 1,136 tons of gold. In contrast, the council noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Central banks’ views towards the future role of the U.S. dollar were more pessimistic than in previous surveys.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the survey findings, &#8220;46% of advanced economy respondents believe the U.S. dollar’s share of global reserves will fall&#8221; while 58% of respondents from emerging markets and developing economies (EMDE) expect it to do so, the council detailed.</p>
<p>Emerging-market central banks attributed their views to &#8220;shifts in global economic power&#8221; and gold being seen as a means of geopolitical diversification. On the other hand, developed economies cited environmental, social, and governance factors as the rationale behind their perspectives.</p>

<h2>Central Banks&#8217; Optimism in Gold Rises</h2>
<p>The World Gold Council described that central banks&#8217; &#8220;views towards gold’s future role grew more optimistic, with 62% saying that gold will have a greater share of total reserves compared to 46% last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The WGC noted: “A majority of central banks expect a slight increase in the proportion of total reserves being denominated in gold over the next five years, with developing economies primarily driving this view.&#8221; The industry body added: &#8220;7 in 10 central banks surveyed believe that gold reserves will increase in the next 12 months. This is a 10-point increase from last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaokai Fan, director for Central Banks and Public Policy at the World Gold Council, explained: “There’s been a major shift in how central banks perceive the dollar and the role of gold &#8230; Central banks move at a slow pace and last year’s events were a shock to everybody.&#8221; Noting that the optimism was not towards the Chinese yuan or the euro but toward gold, he stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was basically a lot more pessimism about the U.S. dollar and a lot more optimism for gold.</p></blockquote>
<p>Central banks cited concerns over rising interest rates from key central banks like the Federal Reserve, geopolitical tensions from the Russia-Ukrainian war, and elevated inflation rates as the key drivers for their gold purchases last year. While the primary motivation for holding gold remained interest rate concerns this year, central banks are also worried about the stability of the U.S. banking sector, inflation, and possible future pandemics.</p>

The difficulty level surpassed the 50 trillion mark for the first time in Bitcoin&#x2019;s history, hitting an unparalleled 51.23 trillion.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Jumps 3.4% Higher</h2>
<p>Data reveals that around <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">373 exahash per second</a> (EH/s) of hashrate is committed to the Bitcoin blockchain, and the network&#x2019;s hashpower has been consistently growing. For instance, on May 2, 2023, at block 787,895, the network&#x2019;s hashrate reached an all-time high of 491.15 EH/s. Due to this escalated hashrate and <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html">quicker block intervals</a>, the difficulty rose by 3.22% on May 18 at block height 790,272.</p>
<p>The most recent difficulty adjustment transpired at block height 792,288 with a <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">3.4% increase</a>. The difficulty climbed from 49.55 trillion to the present 51.23 trillion after Wednesday&#x2019;s surge. This is the first time Bitcoin has registered a difficulty above the 50 trillion mark; the figure of 51.23 trillion represents the lowest value a computed hash must be below for a miner to successfully mine a new block.</p>

<p>This change signifies that discovering a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block has never been more challenging; due to increased difficulties in mining, it now necessitates heightened computational power and resources to find a valid hash and secure mining rewards. Currently, Foundry USA is the leading mining pool contributing the <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">most hashrate</a> to the network with 114.75 EH/s and commanding 30.26% of the total hashrate on May 31.</p>

<p>Following Foundry&#x2019;s lead include the mining pools Antpool (79.75 EH/s), F2pool (55.34 EH/s), Binance Pool (34.99 EH/s), and Viabtc (29.30 EH/s). The network recorded an average hashrate of roughly 366 EH/s throughout the last 2,016 blocks.

<h2>Bybit to Pause Operations in Canada</h2>
<p>According to a Tuesday <a href="https://announcements.bybit.com/article/notice-on-exit-from-canadian-market-bltc1bfb8746d077fda/#">announcement</a>, Bybit is withdrawing from Canada and has suspended new registrations from Canadian residents as of Wednesday. Starting July 31, Canadians will be unable to deposit funds; however, they can still withdraw and reduce their trading positions for the time being.</p>
<p>“Canadian Customers who are implicated by these measures should take steps by September 30, 2023, 8AM UTC to wind down and manage their positions,” Bybit said. &#8220;Failing which, open positions in any margin products and derivative contracts<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>will be liquidated and the liquidated funds will be available for withdrawal.”</p>
<p>While Bybit explained it has always prioritized compliance, it acknowledged that current regulations in Canada have created challenges. “In light of recent regulatory development, Bybit has made the difficult but necessary decision to pause the availability of our products and services,” the exchange explained, without specifying which particular regulations led to this decision.</p>

<p>Following Binance&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-withdraw-from-canadian-market-due-to-regulatory-climate/">exit from Canada</a> due to similar concerns, Bybit has chosen not to mention the possibility of returning to the Canadian market if regulations change. Although a “pause” suggests the possibility. Meanwhile, the exchange is expanding its reach by recently receiving <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-bybit-granted-in-principle-approval-to-operate-in-kazakhstan/">in-principle approval</a> to operate in Kazakhstan.</p>

Commencing on June 26, 2023, users residing in these four countries will no longer have the option to purchase or trade these privacy coins on Binance&#x2019;s trading platform.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance to Delist 12 Privacy Coins in Spain, France, Poland and Italy</h2>
<p>Binance has recently <a href="https://twitter.com/BaleineFR/status/1663868865309278208?s=20">informed</a> its customers in France, Spain, Italy, and Poland via email that it intends to remove 12 distinct privacy coins from these markets. Among the privacy coins set to be delisted are dash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>), verge (XVG), beam (BEAM), monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>), navcoin (NAV), firo (FIRO), horizen (ZEN), secret (SCRT), zcash (ZEC), pivx (PIVX), decred (DCR), and mobilecoin (MOB).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Due to local regulatory requirements, Binance is no longer able to offer privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies in France,&#x201D; an email to French customers details. &#x201C;Starting from June 26, 2023, users residing in France will no longer be able to buy or sell the [specific] privacy coins on our platform,&#x201D; the notice adds.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the leading privacy coins <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins">experienced</a> a 3.2% decline in value against the U.S. dollar. The combined market capitalization of all existing privacy coins currently sits at approximately $5.73 billion, with monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>) taking the lead. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a> has experienced a 2.4% loss today, while the second-largest privacy coin by market capitalization, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>, has seen a drop of 3.5%. However, despite these losses, the top five privacy coins, based on market capitalization, are displaying positive performance according to seven-day statistics.</p>

<p>Privacy coins have encountered delistings due to regulatory concerns on multiple occasions in the past. In 2021, prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea made the decision to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korean-financial-regulator-confirms-privacy-coin-delistings-adds-new-guidelines-to-report-unusual-transactions/">remove</a> several of the top privacy coins from their platforms. This trend was also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-regulator-pressures-exchanges-to-drop-privacy-coins/">witnessed</a> in Japan back in 2018, and it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/state-of-the-privacy-coin-fatf-pushes-delisting-and-exclusion/">gradually spread</a> across various Asian countries in 2019. The recent news of Binance&#x2019;s delisting of privacy tokens comes in the wake of its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-withdraw-from-canadian-market-due-to-regulatory-climate/">withdrawal</a> from the Canadian market and its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-australia-users-selling-bitcoin-at-discount-ahead-of-aud-withdrawals-halt/">challenges</a> with a domestic payment provider in Australian markets.</p>

Litecoin was another notable token to fall, slipping by over 4% today. The global market cap is currently down by over 2% at the time of writing. </strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) fell below a key support point earlier in today&#x2019;s session, moving closer to a six-month low as a result.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.000008784 on Tuesday, SHIB/USD dropped to a intraday low of $0.000008398 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This drop resulted in the meme coin falling below a key support point of $0.000008500, approaching its lowest point since January 8.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that the latest decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved towards a floor at 32.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 33.76, following a failed breakout of a ceiling at 44.00.</p>
<p>Should price strength fall to the aforementioned support point, there is a good chance SHIB will hit a new six-month low.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was another notable mover on Wednesday, as prices plunged by as much as 4%.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD dropped to a low of $88.35 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after hitting a high at $92.59.</p>
<p>It appears that this latest decline comes following a failed breakout attempt of a ceiling at the $93.50 mark in recent days.</p>

<p>In addition to this point of resistance, the RSI ran into a hurdle of its own at the 57.00 mark.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 50.35, which is marginally above a recent support at the 50.00 level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> has somewhat rebounded from earlier lows and at the time of writing, is trading at $89.08.</p>

<h2>BUSD Redemptions Exceed 10 Billion Tokens Since NYDFS Announcement</h2>
<p>Despite tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) approaching its all-time high in terms of market capitalization, the stablecoin economy is currently experiencing its lowest value range since September 2021. A decent-sized fraction of the stablecoin economy&#x2019;s decline can be attributed to the redemption of BUSD tokens. Three months ago, or 107 days to be precise, Paxos made an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paxos-receives-wells-notice-from-sec-nydfs-orders-issuer-to-stop-minting-busd/">announcement</a> in compliance with the directives from the NYDFS, stating that they would cease the production of BUSD tokens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-591133 size-full" title="Stablecoin Economy Reaches 20-Month Low as BUSD Redemptions Surpass 10 Billion Tokens in 3 Months" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/busddddd.jpg" alt="Stablecoin Economy Reaches 20-Month Low as BUSD Redemptions Surpass 10 Billion Tokens in 3 Months" width="1280" height="850" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/busddddd-300x199.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/busddddd-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/busddddd-768x510.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/busddddd.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230213195632/https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binance-usd">archived data</a> from that day, approximately 15.87 billion BUSD stablecoins were circulating. The figure marked a decline of 6.23 billion BUSD from the total of 22.10 billion BUSD in circulation on December 11, 2022. Following the announcement by the NYDFS, the rate at which BUSD was diminishing accelerated significantly, falling below the 10 billion mark on March 2, 2023. Although the pace of reduction has eased since then, data indicates that around 10.62 billion BUSD has been withdrawn since the initial announcement.</p>
<h2>10 BUSD Wallets Hold More Than 92% of the Stablecoin&#x2019;s Supply</h2>
<p>Over the past 30 days, the statistics reveal that a significant <a href="https://archive.ph/l1qfi">15.4%</a> of the BUSD supply has been erased, making it the stablecoin with the highest 30-day redemption rate among the top ten. Presently, the circulating supply of BUSD stands at 5.25 billion. However, it is important to note that a majority of the BUSD in circulation is concentrated in a few entities. To be precise, there are 168,742 unique addresses that hold BUSD, but the top ten addresses alone account for <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/binanceusd/richlist/">92.24%</a> of the BUSD supply issued on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Data from Nansen.ai reveals that the top four wallets holding BUSD are under the control of Binance, with <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/binance">3.124 billion</a> BUSD held by the exchange. Following closely behind is the Paxos Treasury wallet, ranking as the fifth largest BUSD wallet with a balance of 20.6 million BUSD. It is worth noting that the redemption trend observed over the past 107 days did not solely affect the Paxos-issued stablecoin BUSD. Other dollar-pegged tokens such as USDC, DAI, and GUSD also experienced declines in their respective supplies.</p>

<p>USDC, for instance, encountered a depegging incident in March, while ccdata.io <a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/stablecoin-cbdcs-report">research</a> indicates that the May 2023 trade volumes of stablecoins have plummeted by over 40% &#x2014; to the lowest monthly volume recorded since December 2022. According to the ccdata.io study, the stablecoin economy has endured a continuous decline for 14 consecutive months since achieving its current valuation of $130 billion.</p>
<p>Despite losing a substantial 10.62 billion tokens in the past three months, BUSD maintains its position as the third largest stablecoin in terms of market capitalization. However, if an additional 622 million tokens are redeemed, DAI will surpass BUSD and claim the third position.</p>
