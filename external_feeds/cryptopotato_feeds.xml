			            <description><![CDATA[The crypto community was quick to intercept Fidelity's latest question to its X followers.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fidelity recently asked its X followers to choose a new bill denomination. Two hours later, more than half the answers were cryptocurrencies. It&#8217;s another sign of crypto&#8217;s ascendance in the global economy.</p>
<p>The trillion-dollar multinational finance company wanted to know what new bill denomination their social media followers would come up with:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">You get to choose a new bill denomination (don&#8217;t ask, just roll with it). What are you choosing, and why?</p>
<p>— Fidelity Investments (@Fidelity) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fidelity/status/1690015270117560320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It must have been <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/margot-robbie-says-bitcoin-has-ken-energy-as-quip-appears-canonical-to-barbie-film/" data-wpel-link="internal">such Kens</a> replying. Within two hours, more than half the answers were about crypto.</p>
<h2>&#8216;$BTC, and #DOGECOIN, and $Sats&#8230;&#8217; oh my!</h2>
<p>BTC and SATS were among the top replies in the resulting tweet thread. Moreover, someone was relegated to the &#8220;offensive content&#8221; link at the bottom of the mentions for spamming Fidelity&#8217;s post with too many Dogecoin replies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, someone with the display name of Lee answered, &#8220;If you’re asking about dollars, it’s zero. That’s ultimately what they’re worth,&#8221; and signed the terse missive &#8220;#Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although there were the Tradfi answers Fidelity probably expected as well as crypto answers &#8211; like a $200 bill or $1,000 bill. But most of those answers dogged the Fed for inflation.</p>
<p>It may be telling that the inflationary answers like those examples outnumbered the ones given in 1990s prices like: &#8220;$25. A multiple of the $50 bill just makes things easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although someone with a winky Guy Fawkes mask profile pic did say we&#8217;ll need a trillion-dollar bill soon.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">$5 trillion.<br />
We&#8217;ll need a bill worth more than the $1 trillion platinum coin the Treasury wants to mint.</p>
<p>— Joel Jorgensen (@JoelJorgensen) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelJorgensen/status/1690052723821944849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t exactly a joke or satire. Some have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/19/1149924318/would-a-trillion-dollar-coin-buy-time-to-resolve-the-debt-ceiling-debate" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">seriously pitched</a> minting a trillion-dollar U.S. coin. That would, of course, devalue the dollar <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/40-yearr-high-inflation-surged-another-100bps-in-june-tailwind-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">even more</a> to pay off the national debt.</p>
<h2>A &#8216;Normie&#8217; Pitches Smart Contracts to Fidelity on X</h2>
<p>One of the answers to Fidelity&#8217;s conversation prompt, a $69-dollar-bill, was very nerdy even for finance discussions. It was most likely a joke about asymptotic functions and simple fractions.</p>
<p>The replier&#8217;s display name was set to &#8220;Crypto Patriot.&#8221; Blockchain investors and engineers encounter this figure frequently as a result of the work they do with basic math and computers all day.</p>
<p>But another funny answer for a new denomination, whether the replier knows it or not, is something that&#8217;s actually possible in blockchain with smart contracts: &#8220;$12 tip included.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">You get to choose a new bill denomination (don&#8217;t ask, just roll with it). What are you choosing, and why?</p>
<p>— Fidelity Investments (@Fidelity) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fidelity/status/1690015270117560320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Fidelity is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-vaneck-invesco-amend-bitcoin-spot-etf-filings-following-secs-warning-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">currently awaiting</a> regulatory approval for a spot BTC ETF.

			            <description><![CDATA[It's not because he’s not interested – he just doesn’t want more controversy.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Famous podcast host and MMA commentator, Joe Rogan, is no stranger to Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>Having mentioned it in numerous conversations already, both he and his guests have praised the asset before for its absolute scarcity and freedom-focused properties, while contrasting it against the controlling nature of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/joe-rogan-and-post-malone-raised-concerns-of-a-potential-launch-of-cbdc-in-america/" data-wpel-link="internal">Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)</a>. He’s even <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/joe-rogan-reportedly-accepts-100-181807503.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">accepted</a> BTC as payment for one of his comedy shows.</p>
<p>That said, the podcaster’s remarks on Bitcoin are often only in passing. Despite popular demand, he seemingly neglects to host any experts on his show to explain its benefits at length, or to answer common questions about the technology – which he’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/joe-rogan-i-have-a-lot-of-hope-for-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">confessed</a> to not understanding very well.</p>
<p>What might be keeping Rogan from hosting Bitcoin-dedicated podcasts with experts in the field? To answer, let’s examine his only historical exception to the rule so far.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265642" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-265642 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan.webp" alt="" width="960" height="768" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan.webp 960w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan-300x240.webp 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan-768x614.webp 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Rogan-50x40.webp 50w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265642" class="wp-caption-text">Joe Rogan.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The Andreas Episodes</h2>
<p>Rogan has hosted at least three podcasts focused on Bitcoin so far – all with the popular blockchain expert and author, Andreas Antonopolous.</p>
<p>In the most recent of those interviews, the men talked about Bitcoin’s place in hyperinflationary environments, its lack of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cathie-wood-explains-how-bitcoin-can-reach-1-5-million-by-2030/" data-wpel-link="internal">counterparty risk</a>, the implications of a cashless society, and so on.</p>
<p>That discussion, however, was in 2016 – when Bitcoin’s price was still below $1000, and corporate adoption of crypto was a fraction of today’s. Even then, Rogan was giving Bitcoin a fair shake, and exposing his audience to the idea.</p>
<p>While Antonopolous has mostly stepped out of the spotlight since that time, a slew of new corporate and intellectual voices have stepped in to advocate for Bitcoin and digital assets at large. Yet this rise to prominence may be exactly why Rogan has sidestepped the topic entirely.</p>
<h2>The Rise of Altcoins</h2>
<p>Back in 2016, Bitcoin also consumed nearly the entire crypto market. According to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">TradingView</a>, the asset’s market dominance was above 95% at the time.</p>
<p>Today, that figure has shrunk to 50%. Other major digital assets now breathe the same air as Bitcoin, including smart contract platforms like Ethereum (ETH), stablecoins like Tether (USDT), and non-fungible token (NFT) collections.</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin, Rogan has mentioned these alternative assets in more recent conversations – but he’s not quite the same fan.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s a weird hustle,” he said about NFTs in 2021. “I think it’s like a cryptocurrency hustle. It doesn’t make any sense to me… I can have that photo and I can have it on my phone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On other occasions, Rogan has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeTw9WuvxJk&amp;ab_channel=SwanBitcoin" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">admitted</a> to having “a little bit of Bitcoin,” and acknowledged it as “semi-tangible,” while expressing confusion over the thousands of other cryptos and tokens, such as Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>
<p>While no hardened expert, Rogan’s reservations about some cryptos compared to others reflects disagreements within the crypto industry as well. To this day, community leaders continue to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/whats-better-than-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-to-coinbase-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">dispute</a> the role of other crypto compared to Bitcoin regarding value storage, transactions, scaling, DeFi, and other roles.</p>
<h2>Political Implications</h2>
<p>As a host, launching a Bitcoin-focused episode in this climate creates complications and controversy that weren’t present when he discussed the topic years ago.</p>
<p>For example, by hosting a podcast with self-proclaimed “Bitcoin maximalist” and billionaire <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/michael-saylor-thinks-the-sec-crackdown-could-boost-bitcoins-dominance-to-80/" data-wpel-link="internal">Michael Saylor</a>, Rogan might be labelled a maximalist himself, and be subject to all the criticism that comes with that. Similar events have occurred in the past in the realm of politics, where Rogan has been labelled “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-rogan-is-mainstreaming-right-wing-misinformation" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">far right</a>” for hosting conservative voices like <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/jordan-peterson-bitcoin-is-the-only-alternative-to-a-cbdc/" data-wpel-link="internal">Jordan Peterson</a> and Ben Shapiro on his show.</p>
<p>In fact, we’ve already seen another podcaster face the same fate. After hosting Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on his show years ago, Lex Friedman has since been pressured into hosting dissenting voices from across the space. Some of these guests have included Michael Saylor, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous, and others.</p>
<p>However, in hosting such guests, Friedman has found himself further embroiled in online drama, which has even prompted him to release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB5WGV4zlgw&amp;ab_channel=LexClips" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">video messages</a> directly criticizing Bitcoiners for their “style of discourse”</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given Rogan’s history with controversy already, and the example set by Friedman, its likely the podcaster is attempting to entirely sidestep this conflict before entering it.</p>
<p>Though Rogan appears to hold more pro-Bitcoin opinions on the subject right now, expressing these in the form of a dedicated podcast could invite backlash from rivalling communities that he may not like. He may then feel compelled to invite altcoin supporters (ex. Vitalik, Hoskinson, etc) to create a “balance” of voices – whether or not he’s actually interested in doing so.</p>
<p>Bitcoin expert Jimmy Song put it succinctly in a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1689421114953342976" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Twitter post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The controversy will remain on Bitcoin versus altcoins and that&#8217;s not something he&#8217;ll be able to avoid. He needs more conviction before he&#8217;ll talk about it on his show and that&#8217;s not something he has yet.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Until Rogan cares enough to enter the flames of that controversy, it&#8217;s likely best not to pester him further for a Saylor episode anytime soon.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market continues to struggle, with Bitcoin trading sideways near the $29,300 price level and major altcoins like Ethereum and Solana adopting a slightly bearish stance.</p>
<p>The bull rally in major meme coins has come to a halt as well &#8211; both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are seeing selling pressure in the daily time frame, correcting 2.2% and 1% respectively.</p>
<p>Pepe coin has also been unable to carry its bullish momentum and is facing a crucial resistance at $0.14. Nevertheless, experts believe that Pepe coin is poised to continue its positive trajectory and can regain its $1 billion market capitalization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new meme token Wall Street Memes is displaying huge potential, with it now very closely to hitting the $24 million milestone in its ongoing ICO.</p>
<h2><strong>Is The Pepe Rally Over As It Turns Bearish?</strong></h2>
<p>After a high-flying 22% pump, Pepe coin is currently stuck at the $0.0000014 price mark and has also seen a marginal 0.5% correction over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-18.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266385" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-18.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="305" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-18.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-18-300x152.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-18-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Despite an explosive 40% surge in its 24-hour trading volume, the token continues to hover near the $550 million market capitalization.</p>
<p><a href="https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/PEPEUSDT/technicals/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TradingView</a>, a technical analysis platform, continues to give a Buy signal to Pepe coin in the daily time frame. However, it would need to breach its 50-day Simple Moving Average and 100-day Exponential Moving Average at $0.00000144 to see any further bullish continuation.</p>
<p>It is also at risk of falling below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $0.00000138, which can lead to more downward movement.</p>
<p>Popular crypto trader <a href="https://twitter.com/MTI_Trading/status/1691020503677382656?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@MTI_Trading</a> is also dubious about whether Pepe would be able to flip a crucial resistance at $0.00000146.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the meme coin rally may face obstacles from the broader crypto market, as ex-SEC official John Reed Stark believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will likely <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1690707913789112320?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reject all the Bitcoin spot trading applications</a>. The SEC has already delayed their decision on ARK investment’s application and experts believe that other applications will likely go the same route.</p>
<p>The latest Bitcoin and crypto bull run was a result of major TradFi institutions like BlackRock applying for BTC spot trading options. A rejection from the SEC can see major crypto assets retrace their entire pump and enter deeply bearish territory.</p>
<p>The history of the crypto market also proves this assessment. In 2018, Bitcoin and major altcoins saw a sharp decline after the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-etf-rejected-by-sec.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SEC rejected the Gemini exchange’s</a> BTC spot trading request.</p>
<p>However, other experts are much more bullish on the token. Popular analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKaleo/status/1690703555819175937?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@CryptoKaleo</a>, who has close to 600K followers on Twitter, has revealed that the Pepe breakout is just starting and the token will soon regain its $1 billion market capitalization.</p>
<h2><strong>Wall Street Memes Token Set to Hit $24 Million Mark In Presale &#8211; Next 10x Meme Coin?</strong></h2>
<p>While major meme coins struggle, the <a href="https://bs_73dffd2a.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=pepe-coin-price-dips-but-wall-street-memes-nears-24-million" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes token</a> has quickly emerged as a popular choice for traders after its impressive presale performance. The token has already raised close to $24 million in its ICO in less than 3 months, with one presale stage still remaining.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-18.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266384" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-18.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="295" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-18.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-18-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-18-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Even whales are lining up to the presale, with one such investor making a cumulative investment of over $1 million in $WSM.</p>
<p>The token has its origins in the legendary Wall Street Bets Reddit community that inspired the historic GameStop short-squeeze. $WSM is looking to make a similar breakthrough in the crypto market, targeting a $1 billion market capitalization after its launch.</p>
<p>The meme coin continues to get strong community backing, thanks to the global brand value of the Wall Street Memes group. The group boasts of a million-strong internet army and farms over 40 million impressions monthly across its social media pages.</p>
<p>The developer team behind the token has a strong track record of launching successful Web3 projects &#8211; its Wall St Bulls NFT collection drew enormous hype and sold out in less than 32 minutes, netting a cool $2.5 million.</p>
<p>Interested investors can head to the Wall Street Memes presale and purchase the token through bank cards or by swapping ETH, BNB or USDT tokens.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[“We are penciling in 25 basis points of cuts per quarter but are uncertain about the pace," the Goldman Sachs' economists said.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jan Hatzius and David Mericle &#8211; economists at the banking giant Goldman Sachs &#8211; predicted that the US Federal Reserve will start lowering interest rates from the second quarter of 2024. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many experts have previously suggested that such a pivot could boost investor interest in risk-on assets, including stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Still Uncertain About the Pace</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/goldman-pencils-in-first-fed-rate-cut-for-second-quarter-of-2024-1.1958486" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to Hatzius and Mericle, the US central bank &#8211; the Federal Reserve &#8211; will start a gradual reduction of interest rates from the end of June next year. They are still unsure about the declining temp, highlighting 25 basis points of cuts per quarter as the most possible scenario.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target,” they stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The economists also believe the Fed will not increase the rates during its next FOMC meeting in September and conclude that “the core inflation trend has slowed enough to make a final hike unnecessary&#8221; in November.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Normalization is not a particularly urgent motivation for cutting, and for that reason, we also see a significant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goldman Sachs&#8217; financial experts believe the Fed will continue dropping the interest rates until reaching a 3-3.25% benchmark. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Federal Reserve has launched quite an aggressive strategy ever since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to reduce the disaster&#8217;s short-term devastating economic effect by printing colossal money and raising interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It lifted the benchmark 11 times between March 2020 and July 2023, hampering the interest in riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Some believe one of the contributing factors for the digital asset market to flourish again will be the end of that policy. The CEO of Galaxy Digital &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-06/novogratz-says-bitcoin-will-go-to-the-moon-once-fed-pauses?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mike Novogratz</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> &#8211; and the founder of SkyBridge Capital &#8211; Anthony Scaramucci &#8211; are some examples. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What About an Earlier Pivot?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tom Lee – Managing Partner and the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors &#8211; also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fed-most-likely-wont-raise-interest-rates-anymore-tom-lee/" data-wpel-link="internal">thinks</a> the Fed will start cutting interest rates in 2024. Unlike Goldman Sachs&#8217; economists, though, he forecasted that this could happen from Q1:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Most people believe it’s the second half because the Fed doesn’t want to tighten rates, but if inflation’s falling, they have to cut rates. Otherwise, it’s actually stricting the economy more.”</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Large ADA holders remain unfazed by underwhelming price performance.  ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano remained locked in a narrow trading range lately with no volatility in sight. Over the past month, ADA was down by approximately 20%, trading at $0.29 as of now. While this trend has caused increasing frustration among market observers, ADA whales and sharks continued to be resilient.</p>
<p>In fact, this cohort of holders has continued to fill their bags with ADA tokens despite the stagnant price action.</p>
<h2>ADA Whales Show Resilience</h2>
<p>According to Santiment&#8217;s latest analysis, Cardano&#8217;s trader sentiment hasn&#8217;t fared well owing to the 35% decline in the crypto-asset&#8217;s market cap.</p>
<p>However, ADA sharks and whales have remained undeterred. The count of addresses on Cardano with over 100k ADA has rebounded to its peak level since April 2022. In a recent update, the blockchain intelligence platform <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1690983240730054656" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">tweeted</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Trader sentiment toward Cardano continues to be low as its market cap is down 35% since topping 4 months ago. However, the sharks &amp; whales haven&#8217;t been as deterred as one may think. There are now 25,294 wallets with 100K+ $ADA, the most in 16 months.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bull Run Soon?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-ada-whales-accumulate-heavily-below-0-30-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">accumulation</a> trend typically depicts a bullish momentum in the offing. The similar sentiment was echoed by another prominent analyst, Ali, who drew <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1690986678519832577" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">parallels</a> to a similar period of stagnancy between 2018 and 2020. During that phase, ADA&#8217;s price appeared to have oscillated between $0.10 and $0.028 for a total of 665 days.</p>
<p>The accumulation ended with a bull run of over 2,985%.</p>
<p>In the current scenario, the analyst observed that ADA has been trapped in the $0.46 to $0.24 range for 329 days already. If history is to repeat itself, the crypto-asset could potentially break free around February 2024, as per Ali&#8217;s estimation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key takeaway? Patience often pays in the crypto market, and those willing to wait will be rewarded.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even as ADA failed to perform, the Cardano ecosystem, as a whole, was reported to have grown significantly. This is evident from a recent Messari <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-records-impressive-49-qoq-growth-in-dapp-transactions-10-rise-in-tvl-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">report</a> that revealed an increase of 8.5% in Cardano&#8217;s average transaction in Q2 as compared to the previous quarter, going from $0.117 to $0.126. Moreover, the average daily transactions also grew by nearly 2% QoQ from 67,500 to 68,800.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement has remained stagnant after being rejected from the critical resistance zone at $30,000. However, it is currently consolidating near a pivotal support area, which includes both the 100-day moving average and the lower boundary of a multi-month ascending channel.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By</strong> <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>The daily chart analysis shows that the price entered a slight corrective phase at the beginning of July, marked by diminished volatility and subdued price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, BTC is gradually approaching a substantial support range comprising the 100-day moving average, positioned at $28,544, and the lower threshold of the ascending channel, situated at around $28,500. This particular price range holds significant importance as robust support that could potentially prevent additional declines.</p>
<p>However, the current price action within this pivotal support area suggests the prevalence of market indecision, evident from the formation of small and directionless candles. Consequently, if the price receives support and witnesses strengthened buying pressure, market participants could anticipate a decisive reversal in price.</p>
<p>Conversely, in the absence of such support, the price might breach the mentioned support levels, subsequently triggering a cascade effect toward the noteworthy support zone at $25,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266304" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266304" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-266304 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_1408231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTC-Dailuy-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266304" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, it is observable that the price appears to be constrained within a static range, oscillating between the resistance at $30,000 and the minor support at $28,000. At present, Bitcoin is consolidating close to the critical 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, displaying efforts to avoid a downward breach.</p>
<p>Considering the likelihood of the price undergoing a temporary corrective phase, it is reasonable to regard the price range marked by the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels as the most probable target for this movement. Therefore, a positive response within this defined range could potentially pave the way for a fresh upward trend, propelling the price toward the significant resistance level at $30,000.</p>
<p>However, in the event that the price breaks below the range outlined by the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels, it may provoke an impulsive plunge toward the support region around the $25K mark.</p>

<h2><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/tradingrage?lang=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index</strong></h3>
<p>Although Bitcoin&#8217;s price has remained relatively stable, there are significant developments taking place behind the scenes. The Bitcoin Coinbase premium index measures the percentage difference between Coinbase Pro price (USD pair) and Binance price(USDT pair). Positive premium values indicate stronger buying pressure by US investors in Coinbase, while negative values suggest selling pressure by Americans.</p>
<p>US investors include financial institutions and wealthy individuals interested in the crypto market. Therefore, analyzing their behavior can provide valuable insight.</p>
<p>As the chart depicts, this metric has been showing negative values over the past few weeks, pointing to the fact that American investors are selling their BTC. If this pattern continues and the market fails to break above $30K, the price might reverse to the downside in the short term due to excess supply.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York revoked Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) bail on Friday, August 11, the former CEO and disgraced founder of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has spent three nights at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn (MDC Brooklyn).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for SBF, MDC Brooklyn is considered one of the worst prisons in New York City and is infamous for its horrible conditions and inmate maltreatment. Judge Kaplan acknowledged that the detention center “is not on anybody’s list of five-star facilities.”</p>
<h2>SBF Detained at MDC Brooklyn</h2>
<p>Federal prosecutors <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/doj-wants-sbf-detained-and-his-bail-revoked-following-witness-tampering-efforts/" data-wpel-link="internal">sought</a> to reverse SBF’s $250 million bail in July after he attempted to tamper with witnesses. At the time of the request, the FTX founder was under <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-a-250m-bail-can-stay-at-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">house arrest</a> at his parent’s $4 million home in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice pushed to revoke the bail because SBF’s activities, including using a virtual private network to conceal his internet activities, violated his bail conditions. The 31-year-old former CEO also reached out to FTX’s general counsel, suggesting that they become resourceful to each other.</p>
<p>To crown it all, he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/caroline-ellison-felt-unsuited-to-run-alameda-amid-sbf-relationship-drama/" data-wpel-link="internal">leaked</a> the private writings of Caroline Ellison, his ex-girlfriend and former CEO of FTX sister trading firm Alameda Research, to a New York Times reporter. As per the Justice Department’s accusations, SBF attempted to cast Ellison in a negative light to make her look like a jilted lover, thereby discrediting her as a witness in his upcoming trial.</p>

<h2>One of the Worst Prisons in NYC</h2>
<p>Following the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-sent-to-jail-for-witness-tampering-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">hearing </a>Friday, SBF was moved to MDC Brooklyn, a U.S. federal administrative detention facility housing both male and female prisoners of all security levels. Originally built to accommodate 1,000 inmates, the center houses more than 1,600 prisoners.</p>
<p>Lawyers have complained about overflowing toilets, plastic in inmates’ meals, and contaminated water, amongst other horrific living conditions at the MDC. On one occasion during winter in 2019, inmates suffered days without heat, electricity, and hot meals due to a power outage. Prisoners who <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/16/metropolitan-detention-center-mdc-brooklyn-jail/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">protested</a> the conditions were pepper sprayed, thrown in solitary confinement, and had their toilets shut down.</p>
<p>The MDC has held high-profile individuals like American singer cum convicted sex offender R. Kelly, child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, and American rapper Fetty Wap.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SBF’s lawyers disclosed their intent to appeal Judge Kaplan’s decision.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Zug, Switzerland, August 14th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://www.synesis.one/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Synesis One,</a> the world’s first AI data crowdsourcing platform on the Solana Blockchain, announced today the launch of its new Train2Earn App ‘Workspace by Synesis’ on iOS, Android, Saga, and web browsers. The App allows anyone, anywhere in the world to train AI and earn rewards.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Workspace App is a significant leap forward in our mission to provide high quality data to companies developing AI applications,” said Paul Lee M.D., Cofounder and CEO of Synesis One. “We designed the Synesis One platform to connect companies that need quality AI training data with digital workers who can generate the data quickly, and at competitive prices.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The need for high-quality data to train and refine AI models is growing at an exponential rate, as nearly every industry from financial services to health care is starting to integrate AI into their business processes. Without data, AI models are basically useless: they can&#8217;t make connections or find patterns or make predictions. That’s why humans are still needed to train AI systems.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re a bit like Wikipedia,” says Paul. “Synesis One workers are contributing and refining data every day. But unlike Wikipedia, our contributors are paid for their contributions. That&#8217;s why we call our business model Train2earn. They train AI and earn rewards.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The applications for Synesis One are limitless. “Train2Earn is the first enterprise-quality on-chain software where business logic is conducted entirely on blockchain,” said Synesis One Head of Product and CTO David Saccon. “This means the provenance of our crowdsourced data is fully traceable and auditable. We believe we are providing a critical component for a new type of open data supply chain to power AI applications.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="ql-align-justify">In addition to crypto payments, the Train2Earn platform also uses the blockchain to enable a public voting process in which contributors reach consensus about the quality of the submitted data. The result is a web3 application that is secure, decentralized, and interoperable.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Synesis One’s first client is <a href="https://www.mind.ai" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Mind AI</a>, which is building an advanced natural language reasoning engine. The Synesis One community is helping their team of computer scientists crowdsource the &#8216;mental map&#8217; the engine needs to make sense of the world. By training the engine, contributors are also helping humanity achieve the goal of general artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The Train2Earn mobile app is now available for download on the App Store, Google Play Store, and Saga phone App marketplace.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">For more information about Synesis One and the Train2Earn mobile app, please visit<a href="http://www.synesis.one/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"> www.synesis.one</a>.</p>
<h2>About Synesis One</h2>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://www.synesis.one/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Synesis One</a> was founded in 2021 to crowdsource data needed to train a conversational reasoning engine for sister company Mind AI. The platform connects corporate clients in need of AI training data with crowdsourced human intelligence to provide it. The company raised $9.5 million to fund the development of the platform and data ecosystem.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Worldcoin is equal parts wonder and terror.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to push the boundaries of human ingenuity, revolutionizing industries and augmenting our capabilities. Yet, as we marvel at its advancements, the ethical concerns surrounding AI grow more pressing.</p>
<p>Social media is slowly becoming a breeding ground for AI-powered deep fakes and counterfeits that pose significant risks, as they can convincingly manipulate audio, video, and other forms of content, leading to misinformation, identity theft, erosion of trust, and triggering widespread social and economic disruption.</p>
<p>This is where Worldcoin comes in with its audacious proposal to utilize orbs for ocular scanning in exchange for a digital ID. Tools for Humanity (TFH) is the company behind Worldcoin, which is co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman along with Alex Blania and Max Novendstern. The project seeks to build a decentralized proof-of-personhood solution.</p>
<p>However, it has ignited a fiery debate at the crossroads of convenience and privacy. The Orwellian undertones have led critics to fear that the unblinking gaze of the orbs could lead to a dystopian surveillance state.</p>

<h2>Why Worldcoin?</h2>
<p>The digital landscape of 2023 can frequently resemble an unending gauntlet of concealed hazards. Fraudsters employ a wide array of tactics to lure individuals into clicking on deceptive links to siphon their funds. Meanwhile, social media platforms are teeming with unchecked bot activity, further complicating the online experience.</p>
<p>To tackle this, Worldcoin was unveiled in 2021 with the objective of discovering a definitive method for discerning between human users and artificial intelligence (AI). Such a scenario where all online individuals can unequivocally establish their human identity is expected to substantially reduce scams and imposters.</p>
<p>At heart, Worldcoin’s proof-of-personhood stems from the idea that as AI generates a myriad of content alongside a surge in spam, the imperative to establish the authenticity of an individual as a unique real person, as opposed to a bot or another individual, becomes significantly important.</p>
<h2>How Does Worldcoin Work?</h2>
<p>Worldcoin hopes to provide a reliable way to authenticate humans online called World ID with a threefold objective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishment of a distinctive global digital identity &#8211; World ID</li>
<li>Introduction of a global currency in the form of &#8211; the Worldcoin token (WLD),</li>
<li>Development of &#8211; World App &#8211; to facilitate payments with WLD alongside other crypto-assets and fiat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals are required to scan their eyes using a spherical device known as the Orb. This process ensures the authenticity of each participant as a human and guarantees a single registration per person. The significance of this distinct identifier becomes increasingly pronounced in light of the advancing AI landscape, where distinguishing between human and machine holds paramount importance.</p>
<p>Similar to fingerprints, irises possess unique characteristics for each individual. The Orb utilizes the iris structure of the individual&#8217;s eyes to generate a specialized code, functioning as their exclusive identifier. This code is subsequently stored within the decentralized Worldcoin blockchain, safeguarding it against replication attempts by others. Importantly, the scanning procedure anonymizes the data, rendering it impossible to trace back to the individual after the identifier has been established.</p>
<p>Worldcoin is currently working on expanding its practice of &#8220;orbing&#8221; individuals by establishing centers in over 35 countries and continuing to grow its footprint.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266282" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover.jpg" alt="" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/worldcoin_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Tokenomics</h2>
<p>Worldcoin’s native ERC-20 token, WLD, was officially launched on July 24, 2023, after three years of development.</p>
<p>The initial supply of WLD tokens will be capped at 10 billion for a duration of 15 years. Following this period, the network&#8217;s governance will determine to introduce an inflation rate of up to 1.5% and devise allocation methods for the tokens newly brought into circulation.</p>
<p>75% of the initial token allocation of the 10 billion tokens will be funneled to users, the ecosystem fund, and network operations. Meanwhile, 10% will go to the founding team, 13.5% will be directed to investors, and 1.7% will be used for reserves.</p>
<h2>Buying Worldcoin (WLD) Tokens</h2>
<p>WLD has been listed across various major centralized exchanges (CEXs), like Binance, Huobi, Bybit, and OKX, among others, enabling users to purchase the token or even trade for other crypto or stake it.</p>
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap are also available for users to acquire the WLD token.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manipulation Risks:</strong> Despite Worldcoin&#8217;s endeavors to hinder unauthorized access to World IDs beyond one&#8217;s own, there remain loopholes through which individuals can exploit vulnerabilities to obtain multiple World IDs.</li>
<li><strong>Data Privacy Concerns:</strong> World ID enables users to verify their “humanness” online while maintaining their privacy through zero-knowledge proofs and does not store entire sensitive biometric data. Despite this, concerns exist that sensitive data may be exposed in some way, especially in the event of a data breach.</li>
<li><strong>Centralization:</strong> While decentralization represents Worldcoin&#8217;s ultimate goal, its achievement hinges on the successful execution of implementation in the upcoming forthcoming stages. Also, not all components of the protocol, including the Orb&#8217;s firmware, are open source. To top that, operations such as data centers that store the hashes of iris scans and the Orb’s production and distribution are centralized too.</li>
<li><strong>Security Risks Associated With Orb:</strong> Achieving absolute security in hardware systems is virtually impossible. Hence, the security of the Orb presents a significant potential hazard, exposing it to vulnerabilities like fraud, theft, etc.</li>
<li><strong>WLD Volatility:</strong> Similar to other cryptocurrencies, the price of the WLD token may undergo substantial fluctuations as well. Hence, it is important for investors to exercise caution and engage in comprehensive research prior to considering an investment in the token.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Regulatory Pushback</h2>
<p>While Worldcoin itself aims to counter bots and fake virtual identities facilitated by AI, the project has had its fair share of critics since it revolves around the use of biometric data.</p>
<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s aspirations of establishing a global protocol currently appear fraught with challenges. This can be attributed to the mounting regulatory challenges and compliance intricacies as the project maneuvers through varied local legal frameworks across the globe.</p>
<p>The project is facing multiple investigations and regulatory troubles for its operations, with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/kenya-authorities-suspend-worldcoin-activities-over-data-privacy-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Kenya</a> being the first country to suspend its operations over the methodology employed for data collection. Subsequently, its Nairobi-based warehouse was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/kenyan-police-raided-worldcoin-warehouse-in-nairobi-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">raided</a> by the authorities.</p>
<p>Argentina’s Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/another-country-begins-investigating-sam-altmans-worldcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">initiated</a> an investigation on Worldcoin to determine whether it complies with security and privacy rules.</p>
<p>In addition to Germany&#8217;s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority &#8211; BaFin &#8211; monitoring the project, Bavaria&#8217;s data watchdog has also launched a privacy and security assessment. France and the United Kingdom have also raised concerns about the legality of Worldcoin&#8217;s collection of biometric data.</p>
<p>Worldcoin has not yet launched its WLD token in the United States.</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Worldcoin’s launch has been one of the key highlights of the year. Privacy advocates view the project to be a Black Mirror-esque reality weighing down the financial market. The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/worldcoins-iris-scanning-approach-deemed-evil-security-expert-predicts-high-probability-of-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reluctance</a> to purchase the WLD token by many experts in the crypto sector is evident.</p>
<p>Today, the conversation revolves around the potential unprecedented level of oversight and control that Worldcoin creators might get their hands on. Hence, only time will reveal whether the ambitious venture is a cautionary tale or technology to strive for.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP ($XRP) has continued to face selling pressure in the past few days, with the token’s value dropping to $0.627.</p>
<p>The token&#8217;s recent struggles have been linked to lingering regulatory uncertainty following the SEC&#8217;s decision to appeal Ripple Labs&#8217; recent court victory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, excitement continues to build around the XRP20 ($XRP20) presale, which has now raised over $2.7 million as it trends toward its hard cap.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266265" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="344" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-17-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<h2>$XRP Struggles for Momentum as Technicals Turn Bearish</h2>
<p>XRP&#8217;s value has declined by 6% since Friday, with the token closing in the red for four straight days.</p>
<p>After a minor pump last Tuesday, the price has returned to a downward trend as the SEC&#8217;s appeal weighed on investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Price failed to break the critical $0.650 level, which was rejected with a long wick on Wednesday.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266264" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="284" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-17-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This has caused $XRP to create a minor support zone around $0.625, where the price has consolidated in the past 48 hours.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, $XRP is now tapping the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), often used as a proxy for a token&#8217;s medium-term trend.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily time frame stands at 43, signaling the token’s bearish momentum.</p>
<p>However, trading volumes remain robust, with <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap data</a> showing that over $881 million in $XRP traded hands in the past day – a 76% increase from the previous day.</p>
<h2>Lingering Lawsuit Uncertainty Dampens Investors’ Spirits</h2>
<p>The main driver of XRP’s recent struggles is the lingering regulatory uncertainty after the SEC announced plans to appeal the court’s ruling in Ripple’s favor.</p>
<p>The threat of a prolonged legal battle has dampened investor enthusiasm, leading some to exit their positions rather than face ongoing price volatility.</p>
<p>Until the lawsuit&#8217;s outcome is decisively resolved, either through a settlement or a rejection of the SEC&#8217;s appeal, the uncertainty around $XRP will likely persist.</p>
<p>This will make it difficult for $XRP to recapture the bullish momentum showcased in mid-July.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266263" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="319" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19-300x159.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-19-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, many crypto influencers and analysts continue to be optimistic about $XRP’s prospects.</p>
<p>Edo Farina, a crypto analyst with over 73,000 Twitter followers, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/edward_farina/status/1690766446890975232?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweeted about $XRP’s historical resistance in the face of uncertainty</a> – speculating that the token will also be able to navigate the current headwinds easily.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether this optimistic outlook comes to fruition, but Farina’s tweets highlight that some still see a bright future for $XRP.</p>
<h2>Investors Flock to Limited-Time XRP20 Presale As Project Hits $2.7 Million Milestone</h2>
<p>As XRP grapples with familiar regulatory woes, the new <a href="https://bs_b791c467.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=xrp-price-struggles-amid-investor-uncertainty-but-xrp20-presale-hits-2-7-million-milestone" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20 token</a> continues to gain traction by positioning itself as a “second chance” for crypto investors.</p>
<p>The XRP20 presale has now raised an impressive $2.7 million as it heads closer to its $3.68 million hard cap.</p>
<p>By leveraging investors’ nostalgia for XRP’s early days, the project has resonated with investors – priming it for a highly-anticipated DEX launch in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>XRP20 incorporates several valuable features, like staking rewards and a deflationary token burn, which help boost the token&#8217;s inherent value.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266262" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="277" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13-300x138.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-13-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the low presale price of $0.000092, 30 times cheaper than XRP’s all-time low, has also contributed to the growing buzz around the project.</p>
<p>This enthusiasm has spread to <a href="https://t.me/XRP20_coin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20’s Telegram channel</a>, which has seen remarkable growth in the past few days.</p>
<p>Early adopters have also highlighted <a href="https://xrp20coin.com/assets/documents/audit.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XRP20’s clean smart contract audit</a>, conducted by 0xGuard, as another factor that underscores the project&#8217;s legitimacy.</p>
<p>With the presale nearly 75% complete, the countdown is on for $XRP20&#8217;s open market debut.</p>
<p>Thus, as XRP stumbles, investors are flocking to XRP20 – suggesting an exciting few weeks lie ahead for early adopters.</p>
