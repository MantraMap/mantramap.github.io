Republicans tend to be more accepting of fewer limits on crypto products because they are decentralized and different - We believe a GOP sweep of the midterm elections would be the best outcome for crypto" </i>said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at financial services company Cowen.</p><p style="color: #252525;">Generally favoring less government involvement in free markets, Republicans would also likely put pressure on agencies like the SEC stop over-aggressive regulation of crypto firms and seek reasonable regulation aimed at protecting investors.</p><h3 style="color: #252525; text-align: left;">A history of bipartisan support...</h3><p style="color: #252525;">While crypto does have a history of finding supporters from both major parties, many see the Democrats as 'dropping the ball'. &nbsp;Some expressed the desire for what sounded like reasonable solutions to the regulation issues, some even co-authored bills with Republicans.&nbsp;</p><p style="color: #252525;">But at the end of the day, they had 2 years where they held most of the power, and nothing was accomplished.</p><p style="color: #252525;">Then, with some opinions from members of the Biden administration that sounded like they don't understand the basics of what crypto is, many who consider crypto an important issue switched to a firm "Republicans only' stance this election.</p><h3 style="color: #252525; text-align: left;">The crypto industry may get their wish...</h3><p>                  </p><p><span style="color: #252525;">Polls are indicating that Republicans will take back the House and probably the Senate as well. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #252525;">A common prediction from crypto traders on multiple platforms right now is that a Republican win of both the House and Senate tonight could immediately trigger some market movement upward, we'll probably soon see if they're correct.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: black;">-----------</span><br style="color: black;" /><i style="color: black;"><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Ross Davis<br /></i><i style="color: black;"><span style="color: #660000;">Silicon Valley Newsroom<br /></span></i><i><b><span style="color: #3d85c6;">GCP <span style="color: black;">|&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/"><span style="color: #3d85c6;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></b></i></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
