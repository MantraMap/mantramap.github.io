The burden of government debt for every American is 10 times heavier than that for a Chinese citizen, according to the study.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Ranks Second in the World by Debt per Citizen, China in Top 50</h2>
<p>People in Singapore owed more than any other nation in 2022 as far as sovereign debt per capita is concerned, according to an analysis of data compiled by the United Nations. The share of each citizen of the city-state amounted to $117,400, according to the research conducted by the Russian RIA Novosti news agency.</p>
<p>The U.S. is second with $93,000 for each American. In June, the country’s debt surpassed the $32-trillion mark for the first time. That happened after President Joe Biden’s administration and House Republicans <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-republicans-strike-tentative-deal-to-raise-us-debt-ceiling/">struck a deal</a> to raise the debt ceiling at the end of May.</p>
<p>The United States is followed by Japan with $88,400. Canada comes in fourth place with $58,900 and Belgium ranks fifth with $52,600. Iceland ($51,200), Italy ($49,200), France ($47,100), Ireland ($47,100), and the U.K. ($46,600) are also in the top 10.</p>
<p>A number of other developed nations are in the top 30, including Norway (with $42,100), Australia ($36,500), and Switzerland ($36,200) as well as the European Union’s economic power house, Germany, with $32,600.</p>

<p>The U.N. numbers ranked Russia 94th last year, with $2,980 of state debt per capita. At the same time, according to the Russian Ministry of Finance (Minfin) and the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), Russia’s debt per capita was around $2,200, the report notes.</p>
<p>Among the members of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">BRICS</a> bloc of developing economies (Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa), the People’s Republic of China had the highest public debt per capita — $9,900, ranking 47th in the world. Brazil takes 57th place with $7,700. South Africa, where the public debt per capita was $4,700, was 75th, and India was 112th in 2022, with $2,000.</p>
<p>Members of the Eurasian Economic Union (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EAEU</a>) fared relatively well by the studied indicator. Armenia, where each citizen accounted for $3,200 of public debt last year, was 90th, Belarus took 91st place with $3,100, Kazakhstan ranked 99th with $2,700, and Kyrgyzstan was 139th with a per capita sovereign debt of $871.</p>

While copy trading is gaining popularity globally, traders and prospective users from Africa appear more interested in the strategy than those from other regions.</strong></p>
<h2>Africa-Based Users More Interested in Copy Trading</h2>
<p>According to Gracy Chen, the managing director of the crypto derivatives and copy trading platform Bitget, copying trading is a trading strategy which has not only &#8220;disrupted the crypto industry&#8221; but has become increasingly more popular with novice traders. She added that for some cases, copy trading has proven to be an effective strategy during the so-called &#8220;crypto winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>To support such assertions about this portfolio management strategy, Chen made reference to a <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/africas-copy-trading-boom-true-adoption-or-a-passing-fase/">report</a> highlighting the &#8220;300% growth in copy trading adoption in the last 24 months.&#8221; As the report (which relied on Google search data) noted, while copy trading is popular globally, traders and prospective users from Africa appear to be more interested in the strategy.</p>
<p>Described as a method that enables traders to copy specific strategies, this trading tactic is said to link &#8220;a portion of the copying trader&#8217;s funds to the account of the copied investor.&#8221; This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_trading">trading strategy</a> is thought to be popular with more risk-averse investors and traders.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Copy Trading Favored by Risk-Averse Traders</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in remarks to Bitcoin.com News, Chen also highlighted the impact copy trading has had on Bitget. For instance, Chen pointed to the over 400,000 traders on Bitget who have used this trading strategy since its launch in May 2020. The Bitget managing director also explained how the continuing bear market is likely to convince the more risk-averse traders to pivot to copy trading.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the bear market continuing, people will want to leverage professional traders’ knowledge,&#8221; Chen said.</p>
<p>Chen revealed that Bitget’s internal user data already indicates that as many as 28% of traders have resorted to copy trading at least once in 2023. She also added that as many as 109,000 followers of the platform&#8217;s professional traders have made a profit.</p>
<p>While copy trading is the main reason why Bitget’s share of the market has grown over the past few years, Chen told Bitcoin.com News that the platform’s partnership with the football star Lionel Messi has also proven to be a shrewd business decision. In addition, the setting of a protection fund as well as the regular publishing of Bitget’s proof-of-reserves have also helped reassure users.</p>
<p>On why Bitget chose to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitget-targets-middle-east-as-next-region-for-business-expansion-301881737.html">set up</a> an office in the Middle East, the managing director pointed to the region’s perceived crypto-friendly policies. She also added that the presence of influencers and Bitget’s partners in the region also justify the decision to set up offices there.</p>

<h2>Android Users to Have Chatgpt in Their Pockets, Openai Says</h2>
<p>Microsoft-funded AI developer Openai is releasing an Android app for its chatbot powered by artificial intelligence technology, Chatgpt. It will be rolling out to users next week, the company said, but can be pre-ordered in the Google Play Store since Friday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Announcing ChatGPT for Android! The app will be rolling out to users next week, and you can pre-order in the Google Play Store starting today: <a href="https://t.co/NfBDYZR5GI">https://t.co/NfBDYZR5GI</a></p>
<p>— OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1682480558545461249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>With the application, people with Android phones will have Chatgpt in their pockets, the company added, promising them its latest advancements. The app will be free and allow users to synchronize chatbot history across multiple devices, according to the app&#8217;s Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page</a>.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking Chatgpt, built upon Openai’s large language models (LLMs), was launched at the end of November 2022. It has since fascinated millions of users of its web browser version with the ability to understand natural language and generate responses in multiple languages. Although, a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> claims that the chatbot’s latest models are giving less accurate answers.</p>
<p>Chatgpt’s Android app will not share user information with third party organizations and businesses, Openai explained. The data is encrypted and transferred over a secure connection and users will be able to request to be deleted. The Android premiere comes two months after the company presented a Chatgpt application for iOS devices.</p>

<p>Chatgpt’s immense popularity spurred a race in the tech sector to offer competitive alternatives. In February, Microsoft’s search engine Bing integrated a chatbot feature based on Openai’s GPT-4 LLM. Google released its AI chatbot called Bard in a limited capacity in March and it was updated with new features in July. Investor Elon Musk, who was initially involved in Openai, also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-to-launch-truthgpt-says-microsoft-backed-chatbot-is-trained-to-lie/">announced</a> plans to launch a platform he called “Truthgpt.”</p>
<p>According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Apple has been quietly developing AI-based tools to rival the products of Openai, Google and others. Sources familiar with the ongoing work claim that the company which makes iPhone has built a framework named “Ajax” to create LLMs and a chatbot service referred to by some as “Apple GPT.”</p>

In addition, the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC) official stated that digital yuan in circulation amounted to 16.5 billion yuan.</strong></p>
<h2>Latest Digital Yuan Stats</h2>
<p>People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Yi Gang disclosed the latest statistics on China&#8217;s central bank digital currency (CBDC) on Wednesday at a lecture organized by Singapore&#8217;s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p>The Chinese central banker revealed that transactions utilizing China&#8217;s central bank digital currency, also called e-CNY, reached 1.8 trillion yuan ($250 billion) at the end of June. By comparison, approximately 100 billion in digital yuan transactions were recorded in August last year.</p>
<p>Yi also revealed that China&#8217;s central bank digital currency in circulation amounted to 16.5 billion yuan at the end of June. Moreover, he stated that the total number of digital yuan transactions hit 950 million, with 120 million wallets being opened.</p>

<p>Noting that e-CNY in circulation accounted for only 0.16% of China&#8217;s M0 money supply, or cash in circulation, Yi was quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now the balance of e-CNY is only counting two-tenths of 1% of M0, so that the balance is very small, but with this kind of balance (we) support a big number of transactions, which means that the velocity is high and more efficient.</p></blockquote>
<p>The PBOC launched pilot trials for the digital yuan at the end of 2019 and has been testing the digital currency in various cities across China, including Suzhou, Shenzhen, Xiongan, and Chengdu. In July, the city of Jinan implemented digital yuan payments for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-city-of-jinan-implements-digital-yuan-payments-for-public-transportation-fares/">public transportation fares</a>. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/shanghai-clearing-house-introduces-support-for-digital-yuan-settlements/">Shanghai Clearing House</a> also recently added support for digital yuan settlements. Meanwhile, Bank of China expanded digital yuan <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-china-expands-digital-yuan-testing-to-sim-cards-and-nfc-payments/">testing to SIM cards and NFC payments</a>.</p>

He clarified that the BRICS members will focus on de-dollarization and promoting the use of national currencies in international trade instead of the U.S. dollar.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS to Focus on Reducing Dollar Reliance</h2>
<p>The topic of a common BRICS currency is not on the agenda to be discussed at the economic group’s upcoming leaders’ summit, South Africa’s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, reportedly said Thursday.</p>
<p>South Africa, being the current chair of the BRICS group, will be hosting the summit in Johannesburg on Aug. 22-24. Sooklal explained that the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will discuss using national currencies and reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. He was quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s never been talk of a BRICS currency, it&#8217;s not on the agenda &#8230; What we have said and we continue to deepen is trading in local currencies and settlement in local currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Russian news outlet RT <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">claimed</a> that the BRICS nations will announce a gold-backed common currency at the August summit. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, stated that the economic bloc has no immediate plan to launch a currency to compete with the U.S. dollar. Noting the distinction between de-dollarization efforts and the creation of a common BRICS currency, he stressed: &#8220;The development of anything alternative is indeed a medium to long-term ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s President <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-voices-support-for-brics-currency/">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have championed the concept of a common currency as the BRICS nations endeavor to counter Western dominance in global finance. This followed heavy financial sanctions the West placed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies have frozen about $300 billion in Russian central bank assets, prompting many countries to seek alternatives to the USD.</p>
<p>Regarding de-dollarization, Sooklal explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>BRICS started a process that has been expedited as a result of the conflict, as a result of unilateral sanctions … The days of a dollar-centric world is over, that’s a reality. We have a multipolar global trading system today.</p></blockquote>

<p>Earlier this month, India&#8217;s foreign minister emphasized that currencies would remain “very much a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indias-external-affairs-minister-shuns-brics-currency-talks-prioritizes-rupees-strength-instead/">national issue</a> for a long time to come.” Russia&#8217;s central bank governor also expressed similar sentiments, noting that a BRICS currency would necessitate the consent of multiple parties due to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-central-bank-brics-currency-requires-consent-of-many-parties-faces-implementation-challenges/">implementation challenges</a>. Furthermore, South Africa&#8217;s central bank governor highlighted that a common currency would require the establishment of a banking union, a fiscal union, and macroeconomic convergence.</p>
<p>Sooklal also revealed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">more than 40 countries</a> are interested in joining the BRICS bloc, with 22 of them having already submitted formal applications. The diplomat believes that the BRICS group could expand to include more than 50 countries.</p>

<h2>SEC Disagrees With Ripple Ruling on Retail Investors</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kz87iqjgtodx4yygbpooc/SEC-RESPONSE-in-Opposition-to-MOTION-to-Dismiss.pdf?dl=0&rlkey=qaluz6iw3um27i5jnat6jx6mq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new filing</a> for its lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon that some decisions in the court ruling on the SEC v. Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> were wrong.</p>
<p>While noting that the Ripple ruling regarding institutional investors supports the SEC&#x2019;s claims, the securities watchdog stated: &#x201C;However, with respect to the programmatic and other sales, the SEC respectfully avers that Ripple conflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and its progeny.&#x201D; The regulator added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Respectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongly decided, and this court should not follow them. SEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC&#x2019;s filing was in response to a filing earlier this week from lawyers representing Terraform Labs and Kwon seeking to dismiss the regulator&#x2019;s lawsuit. In February, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Kwon, accusing them of engaging in a fraudulent scheme and selling unregistered securities, which resulted in the loss of at least $40 billion worth of market value.</p>
<p>The lawyers for Terraform Labs cited the Ripple <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">ruling</a> as support for their motion to dismiss the lawsuit, stating that the Ripple decision &#x201C;confirms the legal insufficiency of the SEC&#x2019;s argument&#x201D; that certain tokens, including the failed stablecoin terrausd, were securities.</p>

<p>Following the Ripple ruling on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stated that the regulator is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-disappointed-with-xrp-ruling-on-retail-investors-chair-gensler-hints-at-more-crypto-industry-enforcement/">disappointed</a>&#x201D; with the ruling regarding retail investors.</p>
<p>While the crypto community celebrated the Ripple-<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> ruling, there were cautionary voices. Former SEC internet enforcement chief <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-official-warns-of-reversal-in-sec-v-ripple-ruling-on-xrp-says-the-decision-resides-on-shaky-ground/">John Reed Stark</a> and lawyer <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/legal-expert-warns-victory-may-be-short-lived-for-ripple-and-xrp-says-judge-got-the-law-wrong/">Bryan Jacoutot</a> believe that the ruling rests on shaky ground, warning that the decision could be overturned.</p>

Bundle said users must withdraw or convert their digital assets to the stablecoin tether on or before Aug. 30.</strong></p>
<h2>Bundle Says Transition Period Is to Last 60 Days</h2>
<p>The Nigerian social payments platform, Bundle, said on July 20 that it was ceasing operations of its crypto exchange services and will now focus on the peer-to-peer platform known as Cashlink. In a statement, Bundle said the decision to shut down exchange services follows &#x201C;shareholders&#x2019; decision to restructure the business to focus on Cashlink.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Founded by Yele Bademosi, Bundle started operations in 2020 and at the time of the <a href="https://www.bundle.africa/post/we-are-saying-bye-to-our-exchange-services-and-here-is-why">announcement</a> the platform had 50,000 monthly active users and a monthly volume of $50 million. Cashlink, on the other hand, is reported to have recorded over 3 million transactions in under two years.</p>
<p>According to a Technext <a href="https://technext24.com/2023/07/21/bundle-africa-ceases-operations/">report</a> which quotes the CEO Emmanuel Babalola, the payments platform has adequately planned for a transition phase expected to last 60 days.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Irrespective of this early exit, Bundle Africa has made its mark on the African continent, providing our users with a best-in-class experience for crypto, making it easier and safer to access crypto services. Our users can withdraw their funds into any wallet. Over the next 60 days, we will provide our users and stakeholders with unparalleled support as we transition to Cashlink and other services,&#x201D; Babalola said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Asset Deposits and Swaps Disabled</h2>
<p>As a result of this move, Bundle asked users of the platform to withdraw their digital assets to crypto exchanges of their choice. To users holding less than $10, Bundle said to Nigerian users that &#x201C;the last day for withdrawal if you have less than $10 is the 30th of August 2023. After this day your funds will be automatically converted to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For users in Ghana, Kenya, and those from Francophone countries, Bundle said they have to convert their assets to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> on or before Aug. 30. Following the announcement, users of the platform will not be able to sign up, deposit or swap assets in their Bundle wallet (except when converting to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>).</p>

The crypto community is abuzz with chatter, contemplating how these substantial decreases in block rewards will transpire over the ensuing two decades, and speculating on how miners will cope with the impending reductions. The following is a glimpse at the timeline of these subsidy transformations and a projection of the future rewards in the distant horizon.</strong></p>
<h2>From 50 to 1 Satoshi &#x2014; Decoding Bitcoin&#x2019;s Future Block Subsidy</h2>
<p>A fortnight ago, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-2024-halving-presents-new-challenges-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-mining-rewards/">explored</a> the looming Bitcoin halving and examined how bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) miners will need to rely on a blend of inflated <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices and transaction fees to withstand their revenue being cut in half. At present, we&#x2019;re left to scrutinize past block reward halvings and theorize about future ones, since the exact unfolding of events remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Yet, thanks to Bitcoin&#x2019;s structured and predictable design, the community has a fair estimate of the timing for each halving. Following the upcoming halving set for <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">April 2024</a>, the subsequent event in 2028 will further whittle down the reward to a scant 1.5625 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The quadrennial span succeeding the 2028 halving will witness the final block rewards exceeding a single <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>The 2032 halving will dwindle the block reward subsidy from 1.5625 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to a mere 0.78125. Post the 2028 halving, Bitcoin&#x2019;s annual inflation rate will <a href="https://charts.bitbo.io/inflation/">hover around 0.41%</a>, and by 2032, it will contract to 0.21%. Come 2036, the block reward will whittle down to less than half a coin, precisely 0.390625 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>In the subsequent four-year period following 2036, the reward will remain above a quarter coin, but by 2040, it will diminish to a lean 0.1953125 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The block reward will hover above 0.1 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for the ensuing four years, or 210,000 blocks, but will contract to 0.09765625 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> by 2044. Beyond 2044, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will witness successive reward halvings in a host of years, extending from 2048 to 2136.</p>

<p>By the time we reach 2136, the block reward will have diminished to a solitary satoshi or 0.00000001. In a closed economy, where Bitcoin&#x2019;s growth grinds to a halt, miners may grapple with significant challenges if adoption plateaus. This raises a pivotal question &#x2014; Once the block subsidy is reduced down to a lone satoshi in 2136, what will serve as the incentive for miners to continue fortifying the blockchain&#x2019;s security?</p>

<p>The prevailing theory posits that as Bitcoin garners broader acceptance and transaction demand surges, escalating transaction fees will offer an enticing incentive for miners, encouraging them to persevere in safeguarding the network despite dwindling block rewards.</p>
<p>To optimize their earnings, miners will most likely have to prioritize high-fee transactions. This sets up a finely balanced dynamic, and it&#x2019;s still uncertain how the network will adapt as block rewards progressively diminish. Every halving witnessed so far has placed miners under scrutiny, and each forthcoming halving will amplify the pressure on mining participants substantially.</p>

<h2>Top 10 Countries&#x2019; Real-Time Transactions Could Net Bitcoin Miners $89 Billion a Year</h2>
<p>Some argue that this theory relies significantly on the burgeoning adoption of <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">peer-to-peer (P2P)</a> transactions, as a stagnant, closed-loop economy burdened with high fees could potentially buckle under its weight. Should adoption proliferate to billions of users within a globe inhabited by eight billion individuals, onchain fees, even if nominal, could offer miners a substantial reward.</p>
<p>For instance, the leading ten nations clocked a combined total of <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/real-time-payment-transactions-by-country/">118.3 billion</a> real-time payment transactions in 2021, averaging a staggering 324.4 million transactions per day (tpd). If the Bitcoin blockchain could stretch its scaling capabilities to manage 324.4 million tpd with a <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3y">median fee</a> of $0.76 per transfer, miners could rake in a windfall of $246,544,000 daily.</p>
<p>As it stands, miners <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/bitcoin/bitcoin-miner-revenue-daily">accrued</a> approximately $27.67 million in revenue on July 20, 2023, from the daily block reward and fees on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions. The record high for daily mining revenue in the year was $35.35 million on May 12, 2023. Consequently, a hypothetical daily profit of $246 million from fees would far outstrip current miners&#x2019; earnings.</p>

Both Delta Police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Richmond have issued warnings after having dealt with multiple robberies involving prominent cryptocurrency investors over the past year.</strong></p>
<h2>Wealthy Crypto Investors Become Targets in Canada</h2>
<p>Over the last 12 months, numerous home invasions have targeted wealthy digital currency investors throughout Canada. A <a href="https://deltapolice.ca/media/police-issue-warning-high-value-cryptocurrency-investors-following-home-invasion-style">press release</a> from Delta Police headquarters reveals that both Delta and Richmond’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have responded to several such incidents.</p>
<p>“It appears someone is targeting these victims for cryptocurrency, and we believe this public warning is necessary in the interest of public safety,” staff sergeant Gene Hsieh of the Richmond RCMP Major Crime Unit stated.</p>
<p>Authorities have chosen not to disclose specific details, including the number of crypto assets involved. However, they did mention that &#8220;large amounts&#8221; were at stake in these cases, and investigations are currently underway. One arrest has been made, but it remains unclear whether the individual is connected to the other home invasions. In each case, the perpetrator disguised themselves as an authoritative figure or delivery person to enter the victims&#8217; homes.</p>

<p>After breaking in, the suspects quickly extract information that allows them access to the victims&#8217; cryptocurrency accounts, according to law enforcement officials. “The suspects appear to know the victims are heavily invested in cryptocurrency, know where they live, and are robbing them in their own homes,” remarked staff sergeant Jill Long of Delta Police Investigative Services.</p>
<p>Canadian police advise against letting delivery personnel enter your home, suggesting instead to request they leave packages outside. Additionally, they recommend keeping valuables in a safety deposit box or with a financial institution. The authorities also caution against discussing personal wealth with strangers and discourage mentioning it in public or on social media platforms.</p>
