										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aave community voting to freeze TUSD on Aave V2 reserve due to concerns.</em></li>



<li><em>Users are unable to deposit or borrow TUSD if the proposal passes.</em></li>



<li><em>TUSD&#8217;s value dropped, and regulatory issues with custodians caused confusion.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aave community is voting on a proposal to freeze the TUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum pool, as proposed in an AIP.</strong></h5>

<p>After the recent TUSD asset incident, it is recommended to freeze the Aave V2 Ethereum pool&#8217;s TUSD reserve, preventing users from depositing or borrowing TUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum pool.</p>



<p>This has no effect on existing holdings, and users may continue to payback and withdraw TUSD from the Aave V2 Ethereum pool. This AIP intends to take a cautious approach to the TUSD problem. It will enable the community to evaluate the issue before making any further judgments.</p>



<p>There are still 14 hours till voting ends, but the current support rating is 83.76%.</p>

<p>The methods for minting and redeeming TUSD tokens have gotten confusing, with some users reporting difficulties on both fronts.</p>



<p>TrueUSD (TUSD) issuers previously stated that it had &#8220;no exposure&#8221; to the digital asset on- and off-ramp business Prime Trust, which was recently shut down by Nevada authorities. The team also boasts about its trading volume just after TUSD lost its peg to the dollar, escalating coin holders&#8217; concerns over the recent collapse of crucial TUSD custodian Prime Trust.</p>

<p>In the midst of TUSD&#8217;s volatility, there were actions that seemed to gamble against the coin. Kraken said in a post that consumers might obtain exposure to TUSD without holding it by moving any collateral currencies to a futures wallet on their platform.</p>



<p>TUSD <a href="https://coincu.com/198410-trueusd-depegs-at-90-cents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plummeted</a> to 80 cents to one USD on Binance.US on Wednesday before stabilizing at 90 cents to the dollar at the time of writing. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> statistics, its overall market value remained stable in the early hours before plummeting abruptly, losing close to $100 million along the way.</p>

<li><em>Canadian government approves unrestricted trading of Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on exchanges.</em></li>



<li><em>The coin&#8217;s upcoming halving event adds to its positive outlook, but the market reaction is uncertain.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Canadian government has approved unrestricted trading of Litecoin (LTC) and three other cryptocurrencies on exchanges, which is a huge move for the Canadian cryptocurrency sector.</strong></h5>

<p>Litecoin made the following statement on Twitter on July 1 in honor of Canada Day:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

Other cryptos will have a $30,000 annual limit. <a href="https://t.co/6mKya8q6GD" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/6mKya8q6GD</a></p>&mdash; Litecoin (@litecoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1675096923420737537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The impending halving event, scheduled for August 2, 2023, adds to the good prognosis for Litecoin. This will be LTC&#8217;s third halving event, with the block reward dropping from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC. Although previous halving occurrences have often been connected with price hikes owing to increased scarcity, it remains to be seen how the market will react this time. In recent days, the price of LTC has risen dramatically against the background of an impending halving event.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-28.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-28.png" alt="Litecoin&#039;s Unlimited Trading Allowed In Canada" class="wp-image-199415" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-28.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-28-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-28-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-28-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Litecoin&#039;s Unlimited Trading Allowed In Canada 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>Litecoin reached a big milestone as it surpassed the $100 barrier, reaching a 14-month high in price. The hash rate of LTC, which acts as a measure of the blockchain&#8217;s processing capacity, is a significant component fueling its increasing pace.</p>



<p>Additionally, Litecoin has lately avoided regulatory attention from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although the SEC has not categorized LTC explicitly, it has raised concerns about unregistered securities, especially those that use the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. But, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies like LTC are excluded from this group.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-30.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-30.png" alt="Litecoin&#039;s Unlimited Trading Allowed In Canada" class="wp-image-199417" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-30.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-30-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-30-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-30-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="Litecoin&#039;s Unlimited Trading Allowed In Canada 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry and Technology has urged the government to develop a national blockchain policy that defines the country&#8217;s regulatory stance and shows support for the sector. The parliamentary committee also wants the Canadian government to create a unique regulatory system for stablecoins that separates them from other crypto assets, comparable to the European Union&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), which classifies stablecoins as a separate asset class.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the blockchain world, the security of smart contracts is a very serious matter and should be best protected to avoid the risks of assets and stored information. To solve this problem, CertiK (CTK) was born with the mission of providing powerful measures against phishing attacks or computer hacking.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="769" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886-1024x769.png" alt="CertiK Review: The Top Blockchain Security Platform Today" class="wp-image-197837" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886-1024x769.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886-1140x856.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1886.png 1548w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="CertiK Review: The Top Blockchain Security Platform Today 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>So what is Certik? What makes this project stand out? Coincu will give extensive information on the CertiK project and its CTK token in the next article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is CertiK?</h2>



<p>CertiK is a platform for testing smart contracts without the need for human participation, with all operations carried out automatically. Decentralized and blockchain apps will utilize the ecosystem. CTK tokens are used for intra-project transactions. The project&#8217;s developer says that his solution may remove the possibility of faults and vulnerabilities in the programming. A novel mining system based on a proof-of-concept algorithm and an economic model based on the usage of CTK tokens as an incentive for ecosystem players.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">CertiK chain</h2>



<p>CertiK Chain is a consensus-based Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain that seeks to serve as a foundation for infrastructure blockchains and decentralized applications. This addresses the many steps of the application deployment process, such as smart contract compilation, generated bytecode verification versus source code, and on-node execution verification.</p>



<p>The implementation of DPoS with established security enables the project to adopt robust anti-attack measures against assaults such as forged cross-chain transactions or quantum computer hacking.</p>



<p>CertiK Chain&#8217;s architecture is made up of six distinct modules for each level. Each module is in charge of compiling and validating the source code, reviewing the compilation results, producing the signature from the source code, and assembling the blocks based on the signature. Communication modules are implemented in both Ethereum and IPFS through communication channels. CertiK Chain is compatible with several protocols, including ERC-20, ERC-223, and Nano. Its primary goal is to serve the complete spectrum of mainstream applications in order to assure market liquidity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The main components</h2>



<p>CertiK mainnet and many software solutions, such as the CertiKOS operating system, DeepSEA programming language, CertiK Security Oracle, and CertiK virtual machine, were introduced. The project&#8217;s remarkable characteristics include:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CertiK Security Oracle </strong></h3>



<p>In the blockchain, Oracle is used to transport off-chain data into and out of smart contracts. The CertiK Security Oracle&#8217;s aim is to obtain a set of security scores from a decentralized network of security operators who are in charge of assessing the trustworthiness of its source code. By executing real-time security checks enabled by a decentralized network of miners, on-chain transactions are protected from malicious assaults.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CertiKOS</strong></h3>



<p>CertiKOS is a smart contract-based operating system that focuses on security and resilience to hacker assaults.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skynet</strong></h3>



<p>Skynet is a unified security toolset that uses automated algorithms to evaluate deployed smart contracts against a diverse set of known vulnerabilities at scale. Skynet provides smart contracts with accurate security scores, indicating a possible vulnerability to attacks and code flaws.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CertiK Virtual Machine (CVM)</strong></h3>



<p>CVM is a virtual computer that provides configurable information regarding smart contract security.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeepSEA </strong></h3>



<p>DeepSEA is a functional programming language that allows developers to handle extremely complex codes during verification via the Coq proof assistant. DeepSEA is compatible with Microsoft&#8217;s CertiK Chain virtual machines, Ethereum WebAssembly, and Ant Financial&#8217;s AntChain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CertiKShield</strong></h3>



<p>CertiKShield is a fund established to restore funds stolen by attackers as a result of the project&#8217;s security flaws. This fund has collaborated with well-known initiatives worth billions of dollars, including Aave, Celer, Kava, and Matic. The team directly gave 1,000,000 CTK to the foundation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Main target</h2>



<p>The project team created a decentralized proof system that mathematically ensures the stated smart contract is error-free, resistant to hacker assaults, and functionally validated. This is accomplished via the use of a check mechanism. The project is a turnkey solution that makes use of certified kits. They include characteristics like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Smart labeling;</li>



<li>Class-based decomposition;</li>



<li>Proofing tool;</li>



<li>The proof object can test the machine;</li>



<li>Certified dApp library;</li>



<li>Custom certification service.</li>
</ul>



<p>These components safeguard smart contracts by marking critical portions of the code and their intended functionality, as well as breaking down the verification process into smaller jobs. All of the components are then reassembled into a fully operating and tested smart contract.</p>



<p>To accomplish the aforementioned aims, the project integrates the model with machine learning (deep learning) aspects. The system automates the procedure using machine learning and contextualizes its whole work history in the service of its own evolutionary learning. The platform will be able to mathematically describe and automatically categorize contracts based on their proper functionality in the future. This technology will allow for very accurate verification as well as dynamic, precise, and automated contract analysis. Nodes running the software validate the finished proofs.</p>



<p>CertiK is a protocol and smart contract auditing service. Its unique feature is that formal verification is automated, somewhat decentralized, and may be performed in any programming language.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>In general, all platforms and applications investigated, implemented, and created by CertiK will have the objective of measuring transaction safety.</p>



<p>Moreover, using this platform, apps will be able to make precise judgments about carrying out transactions that are part of the transaction.</p>



<p>Its operating system is comprised of the following core components:</p>



<ul>
<li>Business Chain: Certik Foundation will integrate Security Oracle as a bridge to assist the project in accessing information or data about transaction safety and reputation.</li>



<li>CertiK Chain: With this component, users will be provided CTK and will be required to register for tasks. At the same time, the Oracle Operator units will be coordinating activities to record the completed tasks on the chain.</li>
</ul>



<p>As a result, each Operator will be compared to the Primitive Operator in order to examine and re-check the whole safety. CertiK Chain will then submit the results to Security Oracle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Team</h2>



<p>CerrtiK was established in 2018 by two academics from prestigious US colleges. Their primary field of study is computer science.</p>



<ul>
<li>Professor Zhong Shao has worked at Yale University for about 25 years.</li>



<li>Professor Ronghui Gu has been teaching at Columbia University for over 5 years.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Investors and Partners</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors</strong></h3>



<p>Binance Labs was the first hedge fund to make an undisclosed investment in the project in 2018. It was funded by huge names like Coinbase, SoftBank, Goldman Sachs, and Sequoia after the fundraising calls.</p>



<p>CertiK obtained funds via two rounds of private sales (period not indicated), totaling $39.43 million. The audit company then increased Series B and prolonged Series B for a total of four hikes. It was valued at $2 billion in the most recent fundraising round.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partners</strong></h3>



<p>The ecosystem is fairly robust, with key industry partners like Bitman, Huobi, and OKX… on board.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Roadmap</h2>



<p>In recent years, the project team has been consistently boosting the platform&#8217;s quality and efficiency in order to meet pre-set goals such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>February 2021: Completely unlock 9% from the second Private Sale</li>



<li>April 2022: Increase the number of vacancies from the first Private Sales by 29%.</li>



<li>May 2023: Continue to completely unleash 10% of the team&#8217;s potential.</li>



<li>June 2023: Full unlocking with 25% from the Foundation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The CertiK platform is developed by a highly qualified and experienced team. Since smart contract technology is always evolving, the full potential of a project capable of comprehensively verifying smart contracts has yet to manifest. Since smart contracts regulate a large portion of the ecosystem&#8217;s assets, a certification process is essential to confirm that the code is valid and to avoid unanticipated losses or hacks.</p>



<p>CertiK automates the procedure and ensures constant quality. This will assure the ecosystem&#8217;s continuing evolution by offering a novel, rapid, and efficient method of qualitatively analyzing smart contracts.</p>



<p>It is intended to offer security not just for blockchain protocols, but also for any smart contract-based application. By utilizing CertiK&#8217;s technology, the team hopes to give developers and consumers with the tools they need to improve the security of their digital assets.</p>



<p>The project has the objective to become one of the most prominent initiatives. It has every possibility to collaborate with prominent crypto firms and decentralized exchanges to ensure the security of smart contracts in the area of decentralized finance. It&#8217;s simply a question of time, and investing in CTK is best-viewed long-term.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>China&#8217;s appointment of Pan Gongsheng as new leader raises questions about Bitcoin&#8217;s future, given his past skepticism and recent crackdowns on the cryptocurrency industry.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-25.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="593" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-25-1024x593.png" alt="China Central Bank Leader Doubtful Of Bitcoin&#039;s Future: Bear Market Is Coming?" class="wp-image-199406" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-25-1024x593.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-25-300x174.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-25-768x445.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-25-750x435.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-25.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="China Central Bank Leader Doubtful Of Bitcoin&#039;s Future: Bear Market Is Coming? 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Central Bank of China has recently <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23693599" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23693599" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>the appointment of its new leader, Pan Gongsheng. However, this appointment is notable not only for the change in leadership, but also because of Pan Gongsheng&#8217;s history of skepticism towards Bitcoin. In 2017, he made a now-famous statement: &#8220;Sit by the river and watch, one day, the corpse of Bitcoin will float in front of you.&#8221; This statement has resurfaced in light of his recent appointment, raising questions about what it means for the future of cryptocurrency in China.</p>



<p>During a <a href="https://finance.sina.cn/china/cjpl/2017-12-04/detail-ifypikwt6022160.d.html?from=wap" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://finance.sina.cn/china/cjpl/2017-12-04/detail-ifypikwt6022160.d.html?from=wap" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>, Pan Gongsheng praised the decision to shut down Bitcoin trading platforms and stop ICOs, calling it a &#8220;decisive and correct&#8221; move. He further cited an article by French scholar Eric Pichet, which compared the Bitcoin bubble to past examples of speculation like tulip mania and the internet bubble. Pichet argued that no one can predict the length of a speculative wave or where its peak will be. As Keynes famously said, &#8220;Markets can be irrational for long enough to bankrupt you.&#8221;</p>



<p>These statements from Pan Gongsheng and Pichet highlight the ongoing debate around the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. While some believe Bitcoin is a bubble waiting to burst, others argue it is a valuable asset with long-term potential.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at around $30,500, as shown by CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>.</p>

<p>Pan Gongsheng&#8217;s appointment as the new party secretary of the central bank raises questions about how China will regulate cryptocurrency going forward. As one of the world&#8217;s largest economies, China&#8217;s stance on cryptocurrency has significant implications for the global market. With the recent crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, it seems that China is taking a more aggressive approach towards regulating the industry.</p>

<p>Tenet Protocol is an EVM-oriented development platform Blockchain that uses Diversified Proof Of Stake consensus mechanism, meaning that users can use assets issued from LSD platforms as LST to deploy a validator on Tenet Protocol.</p>



<p>Tenet has taken an enormous step forward by acting as a liquidity black hole for LSD. By allowing LSD holders to delegate their LSD to Tenet validators, the protocol draws liquidity from all types of PoS blockchains, providing additional returns on already profitable assets.</p>



<p>Staking Providers active on the Tenet network can issue a tLSD (Tenet Liquid Staking Derivative) which represents LSDs staked to network validators. tLSDs combine two sources of yield and make them new collateral to be used in an expanding ecosystem of LSDfi-protocols.</p>



<p>Tenet Protocol employs veTokenomics at the chain level to direct emissions from block rewards and other dAPP user incentives. Users locking the Tenet asset in this mechanism receive yield from protocols deployed across the ecosystem.</p>



<p>LSDC is the native stablecoin of the Tenet blockchain and is minted against overcollateralized positions of tLSDs. This represents a third yield opportunity for capital deployed to Tenet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The difference between Tenet Protocol</h2>



<p>Although born after many LSDfi projects, however, Tenet Protocol has the following differences:</p>



<ul>
<li>Not only at Ethereum LSTs, but Tenet Protocol supports a basket of crypto assets such as ETH, ATOM, BNB, MATIC, ADA, and DOT.</li>



<li>The use of multiple tokens makes Tenet&#8217;s network decentralized and not controlled by VCs, Whales, etc., who own a single token.</li>



<li>As one of the rare LSDfis that go in the direction of Layer 1 development while the other protocols go in the direction of Collateralized Debt Position (CDP).</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Diversified Proof of Stake</h2>



<p>Proof of Stake is now cemented as the preferred consensus model for new blockchain adopters. The reduced fees and increased scalability it enables powerful smart contract economies. As a bonus, its low carbon impact appeals to corporations and media, which boost the odds of accelerated mainstream adoption. There needs to be more innovation in Proof of Stake models.</p>



<p>Tenet Protocol introduces a novel Proof of Stake framework which retains all of its benefits while increasing security compared to legacy PoS models. This is the dawn of Diversified Proof of Stake (DiPoS).</p>

<p>Diversified Proof of Stake allows network consensus to be reached by validators that stake a basket of assets. This removes the risk of the network being owned by a large controller of a single asset. The probability of a network attack decreases exponentially with each new asset class needed to maintain network control.</p>



<p>The consensus can approve additional assets that can participate in network security, but the genesis stake in network security is allocated to ETH, ATOM, BNB, MATIC, ADA, and DOT. Naturally, TENET is a key part of the basket.</p>



<p>The most important achievement of this model is its ability to enhance network security by evaluating the shared market strength and difficulty of mass control of a robust basket of assets. Any network attacker would need a significant market share in all of these assets.</p>



<p>This allows TENET – from its initiation – to be the most secure blockchain network. It benefits from the combined security of a basket of assets, which, when put together, are more secure than any individual asset in the basket, including ETH.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tenets Protocol products</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tenet Bridge &#8211; Powered by LayerZero</strong></h3>



<p>Currently, LSD is fragmented across different chains and between different wrappers. This results in a terrible user experience for those looking to move their LSD between chains to take advantage of new profit opportunities — such as the triple-tier returns available on Tenet.</p>



<p>Tenet&#8217;s bridge, developed in collaboration with LayerZero, solves this problem. Tenet&#8217;s bridging will allow the wrapping of LSDs from any chain into a single, unified OFT, which can then be seamlessly connected to any network that integrates LayerZero endpoints.</p>



<p>Tenet Bridge will be the first DeFi project we launch on Tenet and will open the door to connecting to Tenet and using other DAPPs built on top of the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tenet Stablecoin Protocol &#8211; LSDC</strong></h3>



<p>LSDC stands for Liquid Staking Dollar Coin and is a soft-pegged dollar stablecoin that is over-collateralized by LSDs. LSDC is created by the Tenet Stablecoin Protocol, a non-custodial decentralized application running on the Tenet blockchain. The protocol allows users to create interest-free loans against yield-bearing collateral assets.</p>

<p>This means that users of Tenet can bridge over their liquid staking derivatives from other networks, such as ETH, BNB, SOL or Matic, stake them to a Tenet validator to receive additional yield and then borrow against those yield bearing Tenet LSDs using the Tenet Stablecoin Protocols.</p>

<p>The Tenet Stablecoin Protocol creates a more capital efficient and user-friendly way to borrow stablecoins against a decentralised collateral base but goes even further in decentralizing the governance (and therefore security) of the protocol.</p>



<ul>
<li>Accepting only profitable capital allows its capitalization rate to remain low, resulting in better capital efficiency than other stablecoin protocols that do not accept profitable collateral;</li>



<li>Managed by holders of all accepted forms of collateral (using our unique consensus layer) and thus avoiding centralization of governance in a single token; And</li>



<li>Can be scaled to adopt any new LSD through our governance system (with Tenet having brought LSD into LSD-free networks to date).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Admin class veTenet</strong></h3>



<p>Tenet is the first blockchain to implement a voting escrow system at the chain level, where users can lock Tenet tokens to receive veTenet, have the power to direct the distribution of the original reward pool, and receive protocol revenue.</p>



<p>Keeping veTenet in your wallet will also allow increased returns on all your actions on the Tenet ecosystem — from staking on validators to providing liquidity on the DEX.</p>



<p>veTenet is an integrated and fundamental approach to operating and linking incentives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Meta LSD</strong></h3>



<p>We have seen an explosion in LSD innovation and experimentation with different types of token dynamics. This presents new challenges for LSDfi pioneers like Tenet. In addition to tLSDs, we will introduce LSD metas that combine different non-replaceable representations of LSD content in a single, composable basket.</p>



<p>The resulting token acts as a synthetic token representing a diverse portfolio of tLSDs. This consolidates liquidity into a single token, which can then be effectively used as DeFi collateral for stablecoin mining and other DeFi operations.</p>



<p>Meta LSD enables the efficient use of cross-chain tLSD to be the ultimate, profit-generating user asset used across the DeFi space — not just on the Tenet network. Aggregation of LSDs also encourages decentralization of validators on the network, benefiting users and protocols on Tenet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tokenomics</h2>



<ul>
<li>Tenet Protocol token information</li>



<li>Token Name: Tenet Protocol</li>



<li>Code: TENET</li>



<li>Blockchain: Tenet Protocol</li>



<li>Token classification: TE 20</li>



<li>Contract: 0x9663677b81c2d427e81c01ef7315ea96546f5bb1</li>



<li>Total supply: 1,200,000,000 VND</li>
</ul>



<p>When you lock TENET to be a validator on the Tenet Protocol network, you will receive tTENET then you hold the key tTENET for a minimum of 1 week and up to 4 years to receive veTENET.</p>



<p>When owning veTENET, users will have a number of benefits as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Network administrator rights.</li>



<li>Revenue sharing from protocols across the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Pros and cons of Tenet Protocol </h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Supports multiple native tokens from other blockchains.</li>



<li>Staking and receiving tLSDToken tokens as collateral allows Mint Stablecoin LSDC to participate in DeFi market and earn higher profits.</li>



<li>Offers interest-free LSDC loans based on Mint fees from 0.5% to 5% on network activity.</li>



<li>When conversion activity is high, fees are high and vice versa. This mechanism helps maintain the LSDC price.</li>



<li>The veToken model using the TENET governance token is awesome. As veTENET holders can participate in the index and share benefits, dumping of TENET Tokens can be prevented.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cons</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>When borrowing LSDC Stablecoin, there will be smart contract risk and initial asset liquidation risk.</li>



<li>Each new block generated will reward TENET Tokens, leading to inflation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Tenet Protocol is creating an ecosystem of products designed for the LSDfi space built on top of its EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain and benefits from the governance power of LSDs housed in the presenter network. Tenet authentication.</p>



<p>Tenet and other blockchain platforms adopt the PoS consensus mechanism and integrate the Project Governance Stake Token into the verifier to ensure the security of the network. Compared to networks like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Cosmos, Cardano, Polygon, Avalanche and Polkadot that accept LSD Token assets, Tenet is more advanced.</p>



<p>Investors participating in pledging assets will be accepted and issued tLSDToken tokens. This asset can be used as collateral for the Mint Stablecoin LSDC to further profit from the DeFi market.</p>



<p>It can be said that Tenet Protocol is one of the rare projects in the LSDfi industry that chooses a direction full of risks and challenges, but full of development opportunities.</p>

<p>Starknet v0.12.0, which has been in the integration phase for some time, will move to the public testnet next week. This version will offer significant throughput and latency enhancements, thanks to six months of work on Rust-ifying the Starknet stack, which has dramatically reduced block execution time and increased throughput.</p>



<p>Version 0.12.1 will include a crucial update that failed transactions will be included in the block, fixing UX issues and protecting the sequencer from spam, ultimately providing a more seamless user interaction.</p>



<p>As for v0.13.0, it will drastically cut transaction costs by targeting L1 (Ethereum) data cost, which represents 95% of current transaction costs. Ethereum&#8217;s EIP-4844 and its Volition (off-chain data availability) will significantly reduce data costs.</p>

<p>Starknet v0.14.0 will introduce a fee market to address potential congestion issues, allowing efficient allocation of the network&#8217;s limited resources.</p>



<p>In v0.15.0, the platform will transition to constant, shorter block intervals by decoupling the 1:1 relationship between a Starknet block and its proof, attesting to the integrity of one or more blocks, fixing block intervals, and enhancing UX.</p>



<p>The combination of future-proof functionality and best-in-class performance and UX improvements are expected to continue attracting developers and dApps to Starknet. With these new upgrades, users can expect faster and more efficient transactions and a better user experience. Starknet is undoubtedly one of the most promising Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, and these upgrades only add to its appeal.</p>

<p>Asymetrix focuses on Ethereum as the underlying asset, as it is the leading asset that generates profits from staking. In creating the Asymetrix protocol, different <a href="https://coincu.com/191618-lsdfi-top-6-potential-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquidity staking derivatives (LSDs)</a> offered by different liquidity staking providers were evaluated.</p>



<p>Currently, liquidity staking providers offer two types of LSD: c-Token (rewards are reflected in token prices, such as rETH, cbETH, and others) and a-Token (rebase, more generated rewards for more tokens, balance updates every 24 hours such as stETH).</p>



<p>stETH was chosen as the main asset because of its transparency and product-market fit. The stETH token is currently the most dominant token in liquidity staking protocols, with a market capitalization of over $5 billion.</p>



<p>With a unique staking mode, the platform allows its users to earn up to 999% APR in stETH. While some users may get a 0% staking bonus, the winners will receive an impressive 500% return on their investment.</p>



<p>The goal is to create an analog of Premium Bonds in crypto with a large number of winners. Asymetrix is going to distribute staking rewards in a way that the basic average profitability for all users does not decrease significantly (e.g., 3% APR instead of 5% for ETH staking) while still offering the chance for super-large rewards (up to) 1 million USD equivalent).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does the Asymetrix Protocol work?</h2>



<p>The first step involves users depositing their stETH tokens into the Asymetrix protocol. On deposit, the protocol generates 1:1 Pool Sharing Tokens (PSTs) for the sent stETH and sends them to the user&#8217;s wallet. These PST tokens reflect the user&#8217;s share in the protocol and are required for withdrawals. Please note that the current version of the Asymetrix protocol has a minimum deposit of 0.1 stETH.</p>



<p>In the second step, ETH staking rewards are accumulated within the protocol, with the balance of stETH growing at the current Lido Annual Percentage (APR) rate and updating every 24 hours.</p>



<p>The third step involves distributing profits to users, with a random draw taking place every 604800 seconds (approximately once a week, with parameters adjusted at the discretion of the DAO). Winners are randomly selected with the help of Chainlink VFR and their exact win rate dynamically changes in real time. The user&#8217;s initial deposit remains in the protocol for the next withdrawal by default, so there is no need to re-enter it for each withdrawal manually.</p>



<p>In the fourth step, winners will automatically receive their reward in the form of PST, which is equivalent to the amount of stETH won. The user&#8217;s balance is increased, automatically increasing the chances of winning in future draws. Therefore, it is unnecessary to claim the reward every time as it is done automatically.</p>



<p>Finally, in the fifth step, the user can withdraw his initial deposit at any time. The Asymetrix protocol will burn their existing PST tokens for stETH tokens at a 1:1 ratio. Asymetrix is a non-custodial protocol, which means users have full control over their funds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why the Asymetrix Protocol adds excitement to ETH staking</h2>



<p>ETH staking may be exciting for large stakers, but it may not be the same for smaller ones. For individual investors with limited funds, the annual rate of return brought by the ETH commitment is usually only around 5%, which makes it difficult to stimulate their investment interest. They often dive into the cryptocurrency market in search of higher profit margins. Besides, the betting process is also considered by users to be complicated but tedious. Therefore, the Asymetrix Protocol sought to overcome these shortcomings.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users deposit staking ETH (stETH) into a common pool powered by the smart contract;</li>



<li>The general team makes a profit every 24 hours;</li>



<li>The profits generated from this pool are distributed periodically (currently once a week) according to the protocol among the participants of the pool in a random and asymmetric manner;</li>



<li>In any event, users keep their initial deposit and are exposed to an increased ETH price, fostering saving behaviour;</li>



<li>All users receive rewards in ASX tokens as an initial distribution according to their stake in the protocol&#8217;s emissions schedule and TVL. See more details in ASX token distribution;</li>



<li>Users always have access to their deposits and can withdraw them at any time.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Governance model</h2>



<p>Asymetrix Protocol was a DAO with the ultimate goal of creating a fully decentralized protocol owned, controlled, and designed by the community.</p>



<p>A user&#8217;s value in the DAO, represented by an ASX token, gives them weight in the governance vote. These tokens will be distributed among users and protocol participants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tokenomics</h2>



<p>The protocol uses the AXS token as the governance token. By holding AXS tokens, users can participate in the governance process, where they can recommend and vote on various parameters and strategies affecting the operation and performance of the protocol.</p>



<p>Asymetrix has developed a unique tokenomics model around cultivating thrifty behavior and providing equal earning opportunities for all users. The $ASX governance token, based on the ERC-20 standard, has a total supply of 100 million.</p>

<p>Token Allocation:</p>



<ul>
<li>50% of the tokens are allocated to the Community, with 40 million having a 12-month cliff followed by linear vesting over 48 months, and 10 million tokens available initially;</li>



<li>25% of the tokens are allocated to the Team and Founders with a 12-month cliff and 48-month vesting period;</li>



<li>25% are allocated to investors with a 12-month cliff and 48-month vesting period.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The Asymetrix protocol allows holders of a small amount of ETH to participate in the exciting world of LSDfi, where they can enjoy high returns and randomness through asymmetric reward distribution. The protocol is also easy to use, as users simply deposit stETH into the smart contract and wait for weekly withdrawals.</p>



<p>The Asymetrix protocol does exactly what its name suggests. It distributes bet profits asymmetrically. In other words, it randomly allocates additional bonuses as you bet. The protocol tries to attract as many people staking ETH. In return, you can get a great reward. In return, you can get a great reward. That&#8217;s why, now add Asymetrix to the mix. You can earn interest on your stETH and can withdraw at any time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">APE</h2>



<p>Notwithstanding the uncertainty that APE investors are experiencing, there is newfound optimism for them as a new hybrid token offers incredible potential for big returns. This has piqued the interest of APE investors, who are now reducing their losses and shifting their focus to the hybrid meme currency, which is expected to provide a 20,000% Return for investors by the end of 2023. This large outflow of APE whales is a big contributor to the APE coin&#8217;s continuous price decline. 15,601,326 tokens will be unlocked in July corresponding to $34,322,917 and 1.56% of total supply.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">An attacker exploiting Huobi’s mistakes would have had the opportunity to carry out the largest crypto theft in history. The company has previously reported handling over a billion dollars a day in trading volume. If Huobi hadn’t taken action, this breach could have been leveraged to steal user accounts and assets. The company deleted the compromised account and their users are no longer at risk.</p>

<p>Huobi has confirmed the incident and stated that it was caused by the irregular operation of relevant personnel in the S3 barrel of the test environment of the Japanese station. The relevant user information was completely isolated on October 8, 2022.</p>



<p>After the incident was discovered by the white hat team, Huobi&#8217;s security team took action on June 21, 2023, and immediately closed the relevant file access permissions. The vulnerability has been fixed, and all relevant user information has been deleted. Huobi has thanked the White Hat team for their contributions to its security.</p>



<p>Huobi’s updated response stated that the OTC data mentioned in the article is not real transaction data, but test data. The user information leak only involves 4,000 users. The log shows that only the white hat team has downloaded the data, and the team has also stated that they have deleted it. Therefore, no actual leakage has occurred.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Coinbase will also supply services for Valkyrie and Bitwise's bitcoin spot ETF, according to individuals familiar with the situation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase partners with Valkyrie, Bitwise, and others for Bitcoin ETF services, potentially boosting revenue amid low crypto-exchange volumes.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange&#8217;s role as custody and market monitoring provider addresses fraud concerns, crucial for SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs.</em></li>



<li><em>Fidelity and other firms include Coinbase in revised filings, highlighting the significance of monitoring mechanisms for SEC approval and increasing token values.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/fidelity-leads-flurry-of-bitcoin-btc-etf-refilings-to-answer-sec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, Coinbase will also supply services for Valkyrie and Bitwise&#8217;s bitcoin spot ETF, according to individuals familiar with the situation.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-1024x682.jpeg" alt="Coinbase To Support Valkyrie And Bitwise Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Report" class="wp-image-199351" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase To Support Valkyrie And Bitwise Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Report 31"></a></figure></div>


<p>Coinbase&#8217;s partnership with the planned ETFs might result in an increase in income at a time when the crypto-exchange sector is experiencing low volumes. Coinbase&#8217;s revenue last year was less than half of what it was in 2021, when the sector was booming. The announcement also comes amid Coinbase&#8217;s legal fight with the SEC, which accused the company of operating an unlawful exchange.</p>



<p>Coinbase will become the custody-sharing agreement partner of Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, according to <a href="https://coincu.com/199318-cboe-updates-bitcoin-etf-spot-profile-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent reporting</a>.</p>



<p>Fidelity Investments led a flurry of corporations that submitted a second batch of applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund on Friday afternoon to add additional information after the US Securities and Exchange Commission suggested that the earlier files were inadequate.</p>



<p>The companies are among eight that are attempting to establish the first generation of US spot Bitcoin ETFs. In mid-June, BlackRock Inc. surprised the market by registering for such a fund.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-1024x682.png" alt="Coinbase To Support Valkyrie And Bitwise Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Report" class="wp-image-199353" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-768x511.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-750x499.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-1140x759.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase To Support Valkyrie And Bitwise Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Report 32"></a></figure></div>


<p>All five that refiled on Friday said that Coinbase Global Inc. would offer market monitoring in support of their funds, which was not included in prior revisions.</p>



<p>Crypto market monitoring might be crucial in obtaining SEC clearance for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The monitoring may significantly minimize fraud and market manipulation, which have been the primary reasons the SEC has rejected about 30 spot Bitcoin ETF applications so far.</p>



<p>According to a source familiar with the subject who was not allowed to talk publicly about the arrangements, Coinbase is also in line to supply different services for the other planned fund issuers. These firms, in addition to BlackRock, include Valkyrie and Bitwise. In a recent filing, 21Shares said that Coinbase would also offer custody services.</p>



<p>The crypto community is ecstatic at the possibility of cryptocurrency possibly becoming more accessible to average investors, and the surge of filings has boosted token values.</p>



<p>Bitcoin reclaimed the $30,000 mark in June and is trading at nearly its highest levels in almost a year. The coin is now worth roughly $30,400.</p>
