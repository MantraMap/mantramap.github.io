<ul><li>Gala Games’ native token $GALA has gone up 142% over the past week according to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gala" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gala" rel="nofollow noopener">Coingecko</a>.</li><li>The play-to-earn platform recently announced the acquisition of Ember Entertainment, which had positively impacted the token’s price. </li><li>The platform has also partnered up with Hollywood superstars Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg.</li><li>Opportunistic traders have begun shorting the token while anticipating the momentum to die out. </li></ul>



<p>Gala Games, the popular blockchain-based pay-to-earn <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gala-games-attack-token-bleeds/">platform</a>, revealed multiple high-profile developments over the past couple of days. These developments have had a rather bullish effect on their native token $GALA. The ERC-20 token has gone from $0.023 all the way up to $0.045, within a span of 48 hours, marking an impressive bullish run of nearly 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gala Games acquires Ember Entertainment</strong></h2>



<p>Earlier today, Gala Games confirmed that it had&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames/status/1612610162304376832?t=XT8CW9cJ5OXA6ydB5yx_SQ&amp;s=19" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired</a>&nbsp;Ember Entertainment, the game studio behind the popular play-to-earn game The Walking Dead: Empires. Both parties were involved in the development of this game and rumors about the acquisition had been going around over the past few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The acquisition paves the way for Gala to onboard more than 20 million active users. According to an update provided by the platform, two high-priority games, Dragon Strike and Meow Match, are currently at the center of their attention. Both the games will be integrated into the platform’s layer 1 blockchain and use the native token $GALA as gas fees. According to the platform&#8217;s developers, 50% of the gas will be burned while the rest will be distributed among the node operators, founders, and partners of the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the acquisition, Gala Games also announced partnerships with popular Hollywood stars Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg. Furthermore, the GALA token will be used to power its flagship play-to-earn game&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames/status/1612565011909562378?s=20&amp;t=9Vgr8cf4C5_KQR1eXCdzkA" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Townstar</a>. All $TOWN tokens will be swapped for GALA at a 2:1 ratio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impressive bull run of GALA came to an end earlier today after opportunistic degen traders started shorting the token. The traders anticipated that the momentum of the news was set to run out and that the token would correct itself. Data from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gala/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>&nbsp;shows that the $GALA is currently trading at $0.042. The recent developments led its trading volume to skyrocket to levels which were last witnessed in March 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the letter, DCG&#8217;s CEO Barry Silbert acknowledged the current state of the market, which has led the company to reduce its workforce and wind down its wealth management subsidiary, HQ, which was incubated in 2020. Silbert also acknowledged the challenges facing the industry, which has seen a wave of fraud and criminal behavior that has damaged its reputation.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, Silbert remains optimistic about the future, saying, &#8220;I hope this letter and the accompanying Q&amp;A that explains other developments and addresses some of the speculation about DCG – some of which is reasonable and some that is completely baseless and false – help to clarify our position.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss said there&#8217;s no path forward as long as Barry Silbert remains CEO of Digital Currency Group.</li><li>The letter demanded that the DCG board out Silbert and install new management, while also accusing Silbert&#8217;s conglomerate of accounting fraud.</li><li>Tuesday&#8217;s letter was the latest in the spat between Gemini and DCG after Winklevoss publicly called out Silbert on January 2, 2023.</li></ul>



<p>President and Co-Founder of Gemini Cameron Winklevoss escalated the ongoing spat with Digital Currency Group CEO and Founder Barry Silbert, accusing Silbert of accounting fraud and demanding that the company’s board install new management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Winklevoss shared an open letter to the DCG board via Twitter on Tuesday, claiming that Genesis defrauded 340,000 Gemini Earn users and other creditors of roughly $1.67 billion by making “false statements and misrepresentations” regarding Genesis’s financial strength.&nbsp;Notably, Genesis is owned by Silbert&#8217;s DCG. </p>



<p>Bankrupt crypto broker Genesis reportedly cut a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet after lending $2.4 billion to crumbled crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Winklevoss goes on to accuse Silbert of doing nothing to address his company’s deteriorating books despite having “two legitimate options” to either restructure Genesis’s lending structure or fill the $1.2 billion hole left by 3AC’s crash.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>At that point in time, the Genesis loan book was approximately $8 billion, which means that the $1.2 billion loss from 3AC would account for roughly 15% of the loan book’s assets. A restructuring then could have addressed this shortfall to achieve a full recovery of assets for all lenders &#8211; including Earn users &#8211; in a short amount of time and give them direct access to liquidity. But Barry chose not to do this. He also chose not to fill the $1.2 billion hole. Instead, he pretended to.</p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to allegations of coordinated accounting fraud within Silbert’s mammoth company, Winklevoss also accused former Genesis CEO Michael Moro of making “false and misleading” statements. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/genesis-moro-steps-down-staff-cuts-3ac/">Moro</a> claimed that DCG “assumed certain liabilities of Genesis related to 3AC” on July 6, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCG agreed to a $1.1 billion promissory note with Genesis supposedly meant to stabilize the crypto broker. However, Winklevoss called the deal a “gimmick” that failed to address the company’s liquidity crunch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Gemini President Sees No Path Forward With Silbert Leading DCG</h2>



<p>Winklevoss opined that DCG requires new management for the benefit of all involved parties. In Tuesday’s open letter, Gemini’s President <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/10/billionaire-cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-removal-of-lying-barry-silbert-ceo-of-flailing-crypto-conglomerate-dcg/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/10/billionaire-cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-removal-of-lying-barry-silbert-ceo-of-flailing-crypto-conglomerate-dcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requested</a> that the DCG board immediately remove Barry Silbert as CEO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCB’s board has five members per information available on Crunchbase. The board members include Jim Robinson, Lawrence Lenihan, Matt Haris, Glenn Hutchins, and Rocky Motwani. </p>



<p>The group called Cameron&#8217;s letter a &#8220;desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt from&#8221; in a Twitter reply on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The letter came as the second public move from Winklevoss in a bid to push DCG into action and seemingly expose Sibert’s unwillingness to “find a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable. Gemini’s Co-Founder had previously called on Silbert in an open letter on January 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coinbase announced that it will be downsizing its workforce by around 20% or 950 employees, as part of a restructuring effort set to be completed by the end of Q2 2023</p>



<p>According to the company, the decision to restructure is a response to &#8220;ongoing market conditions impacting the crypto economy,&#8221; as stated in a filing with the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978823000003/coin-20230110.htm" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978823000003/coin-20230110.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </a></p>



<p>&#8220;While it is always painful to part ways with our fellow colleagues, there was no way to reduce our expenses significantly enough, without considering changes to headcount,” Armstrong said on a memo.</p>



<p>“The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry,” he said, adding there’s likely more “shoes to drop.” in an interview to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/coinbase-to-slash-20percent-of-workforce-in-second-major-round-of-job-cuts.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/coinbase-to-slash-20percent-of-workforce-in-second-major-round-of-job-cuts.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</p>



<p>“We may not have seen the last of it — there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to make sure that they’re following the rule&#8221;</p>



<p> “Long term that’s a good thing. But short term, there’s still a lot of market fear.” </p>



<p>The company anticipates that the restructuring process will cost between $149 million and $163 million, including cash charges of $58 million-$68 million related to employee severance. </p>



<p>This downsizing follows a similar round of job <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-operational-efficiency-plans/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-operational-efficiency-plans/">cuts </a>made last year when the crypto market was in a bear phase. CEO Brian Armstrong explained that the company had grown too quickly during the bull market, leading to the need to reduce expenses in order to increase the company&#8217;s chances of success in any market scenario. </p>



<p>&#8220;One of the crazy parts about our industry is that in any given year we might be growing 300-500% or -50%. It makes it incredibly challenging to plan and culturally to absorb so many people during up periods.” &#8211; CEO Armstrong previously stated on his Official Twitter Account.</p>



<p>In addition to job cuts, Coinbase will also be discontinuing several projects with a &#8220;lower probability of success.&#8221; </p>



<p>According to CoinDesk, nearly 27,000 jobs have been lost across the crypto industry since April 2020.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has been significantly impacted in recent months due to the fall of one of the industry&#8217;s major players, FTX. The incident has led to increased pressure and scrutiny on the sector, with some individuals, such as FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, being referred to as &#8220;unscrupulous actors&#8221; in the industry.</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Shares Increased 6% After the Announcement.</strong></h2>



<p>Shares of Coinbase saw a 6% increase in value after the company announced the job cuts.</p>



<p>While the move will result in a significant reduction in staff, it is expected to also bring cost savings for the company. Investors appear to be taking the news positively, with the stock seeing a significant boost in value following the announcement. </p>



<p>It should be noted that this kind of downsizing is not uncommon in crypto, where volatility is high, and the industry is constantly evolving. A few crypto companies have already announced layoffs, such as Crypto.Com, Gemini, Celsius, and others.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>Another SBF lieutenant looks to jump off the sunken FTX ship as prosecutors prepare for a mammoth criminal trial against the disgraced crypto tycoon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former FTX lead engineer, Nishad Singh, met with federal prosecutors from the South District of New York (SDNY) to discuss the crash of the crypto exchange and Sam Bankman-Fried’s political donations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-10/third-bankman-fried-associate-nishad-singh-met-with-prosecutors?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, SDNY investigators conducted a proffer session with Singh sometime last week. Proffer sessions are used by prosecutors to assess the information a potential witness might provide. These talks are commonly held under the umbrella of limited immunity, although proffer sessions are not a surefire method for securing cooperation deals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Citing sources familiar with the matter, details on Sam Bankman-Fried’s donations to political candidates were reportedly discussed by Singh and U.S. federal prosecutors. Indeed, Singh’s testimony could prove key in proving or discrediting charges of campaign finance violations filed about the fallen FTX founder SBF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from the Federal Election Commission showed that Bankman-Fried donated at least $42 million to bipartisan candidates. Complaints and charges lodged by U.S. prosecutors alleged that customer funds might have been used to finance these political donations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FTX Inner Circle Flip On Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>Singh became the third member of Bankman-Fried’s so-called “inner circle” to meet with U.S. Attorneys. In late December 2022, ex-CEO of Alameda Research Caroline Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud as part of a plea deal. FTX Co-Founder Gary Wang was also cooperating with prosecutors, per <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2022/12/21/ftx-alameda-gary-wang-and-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-fraud/" rel="noopener">reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel Friedberg, a former chief regulatory officer of the crippled crypto exchange, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-lawyer-prosecutor-sam-bankman-fried/">shared</a> inside information on SBF’s crypto empire in November. Brett Harrison who served as president of FTX U.S. until September 2022, also promised to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-us-president-teases-insider/">disclose</a> insider info “in time”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial is scheduled for October 2023. Prosecutors <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">indicted</a> SBF on eight criminal charges including fraud and money laundering.  In response, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all eight charges. </p>

<p>The ongoing <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/nft-marketplace-superrare-downsizes-30-of-staff-due-to-extended-crypto-winter/">crypto winter</a> seems to have had little impact on the Hong Kong government’s ambitions to establish the region as a crypto hub. Unlike neighboring countries including Singapore, which have moved to limit their exposure to the volatile crypto industry, Hong Kong has ramped up its efforts to attract talent and enterprises from this space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Hong Kong to issue tokenized green bonds</strong></h2>



<p>While speaking at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cyberport.hk/files/63bbe1bc906dc198207375/20230109%20Hong%20Kong%20Web3%20Innovator%20Summit%20&amp;%20Web3%20Hub@Cyberport%20Inauguration%20Ceremony.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cyberport</a>, a state-sponsored tech incubator, Financial Secretary Paul Chan revealed that the local regulatory agencies and the government are currently involved in several pilot projects in the crypto space. This includes tokenized green bonds that will be issued by the government for subscription by institutional investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hong Kong is at the golden starting point for financial developments in respect of Web3 and virtual assets. Our thinking is to put in place appropriate and proportionate supervision to unleash the potential of Web3..” Secretary Chan stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The secretary also revealed that the government is in active communication with multiple companies and start-ups in the crypto space. These companies have been invited to set up their international headquarters in Hong Kong. The listing of the companies on the local stock exchange is also on the table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joseph Chan, the Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1683088-20230109.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a>&nbsp;the need to develop the required technology for virtual currency, virtual asset exchange, metaverse exploration, and innovative applications in which securities issuance and trade finance can be conducted through tokenization.</p>



<p>Just last month, the government of Hong Kong concluded the legislative process of setting up a licensing system for virtual asset service providers. Under this system, proper safeguards have been put into place to prevent money laundering and terror financing activities, while enhancing consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. CFTC has filed manipulation charges against Avraham Eisenberg.</li><li>In October 2022, Eisenberg exploited Mango Markets to the tune of $110 million.&nbsp;</li><li>The exploiter was arrested last month and is facing criminal charges filed by the US Department of Justice.&nbsp;</li><li>Eisenberg has maintained that his actions were legal.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S Commodities and Futures Trading Commission has filed charges against Avraham Eisenberg, the man responsible for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mango-markets-avraham-eisenberg-arrested/">exploiting</a> Mango Markets in October 2022. The self-proclaimed game theorist was arrested last month in Puerto Rico for his role in the exploit that led to $110 million being drained from the decentralized exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exploit had left Mango Markets facing liquidity issues. Within days of the attack, the DEX had negotiated a settlement with Eisenberg, as per which he returned $67 million worth of stolen tokens. He walked away with nearly $47 million.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>CFTC alleges manipulation of swaps on Mango Markets</strong></h2>



<p>Per the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66707334/1/unknown-case-title/" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a> made by the CFTC, Avraham Eisenberg allegedly violated federal commodities law by deploying a “manipulative and deceptive scheme” to artificially inflate the price of the MNGO token through swaps, and subsequently manipulate the swap contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Mango Markets exploiter is currently in custody and facing criminal charges from the U.S. Department of Justice, precisely one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation. Eisenberg has maintained that his actions were legal, going as far as calling the exploit a “highly profitable trading strategy”.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.</p>&mdash; Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326199682265088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">October 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Avraham Eisenberg’s public acknowledgment of his role in the exploit has been cited as an admission of the crime by the CFTC in the court filing. This includes his <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter thread</a> that addressed the exploit. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Contrary to his purported belief that his actions were legal, in fact, they constituted blatant manipulation of spot prices and swaps” </p><cite>the CFTC alleged.&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>The CFTC&#8217;s decision to file separate charges in a matter involving  swaps on decentralized exchanges is being viewed as a power play for jurisdiction by some in the crypto community. The agency has been going back and forth with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the matter of oversight of the crypto industry. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The Korean division plans to operate on its own and separate from Huobi Global, the parent company of the Singapore-based crypto exchange.</li><li>Local media house News1 reported ongoing negotiations for an equity deal between major shareholders.</li><li>The separation comes on the heels of staff cuts and changes to the company&#8217;s operational structure.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Huobi Korea is on the verge of separating from its parent entity amid internal restructuring and staff cuts, local media outlet News1 reported on Monday. According to the report, the Korean division of the major crypto exchange plans to operate a standalone business moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the process, major stakeholders within the company will negotiate an equity deal. Huobi Global Founder Leon Lin currently who owns roughly 72% of the platform’s Korean subsidiary, will reportedly split ownership between Chairman Jo Guk-Bong and other majority shareholders at the crypto exchange per New1’s <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/4919434" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lin founded the crypto exchange over a decade ago in 2013. Since then, the platform has grown into an authority in the digital asset trading ecosystem. According to data pulled from CoinMarketCap, the platform ranks among the top 20 cryptocurrency exchanges by daily trading volume.</p>



<h2>Huobi Crisis</h2>



<p>Monday’s news came amid a raft of developments at the crypto exchange giant. Similar to other virtual currency trading venues like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-operational-efficiency-plans/">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-crypto-exchange-reportedly-lays-off-an-additional-7-of-its-staff/">Gemini</a>, Huobi announced staff layoffs of about 20% at the start of January 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to reducing the team size, Huobi also restructured the payment method for local employees. According to a company email, employees will receive their salaries in Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin currency in crypto at press time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Huobi Advisor Justin Sun Backs Crypto Exchange Amid Massive Withdrawal</h2>



<p>Indeed, Tron Founder Justin Sun <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-transfers-100-million-into-huobi-amid-insolvency-rumors/">transferred</a> $100 million in the stablecoin to the platform as users bombarded the crypto exchange with withdrawal requests. Security firm PeckShield reported that Sun moved 50 million USDT and 50 million in Circle USD Coin (USDC) in a bid to restore confidence in the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sun’s monster asset transfer happened in the middle of rumors that claimed Huobi might be insolvent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>

<p>Brett Harrison, former President of FTX U.S., said he plans to share information about Sam Bankman-Fried’s bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange “in time”. Harrison disclosed his intentions via Twitter on Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 9, a Twitter user asked Harrison what he knew about FTX U.S. and when he knew about operations at the company. Harrison replied saying “I’ll share in time”, leading observers to believe that the former crypto exchange executive will cooperate with prosecutors in the criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Who is Brett Harrison?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Harrison joined FTX’s ranks in May 2021, serving as President of the platform’s American division for over a year. In September 2022, Harrison resigned from his role roughly two months before Bankman-Fried’s $32 billion empire crumbled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before joining SBF’s company, Harrison was a top executive at Citadel Securities. Cital is the largest designated market maker on the New York Stock Exchange and services over 50 countries. Harrison also worked at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm where SBF worked as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per reports from December 2022, Harrison’s latest business endeavor involved bootstrapping a crypto trading software startup.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Executives Under Investigation</h2>



<p>U.S. agencies opened a myriad of inquiries into FTX’s crash after the crypto exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2022. The company’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the United States shortly after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried faces eight counts of criminal charges including fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-lawyer-prosecutor-sam-bankman-fried/">allege</a> that SBF knowingly stole FTX customer funds to finance Alameda Research, his trading giant led by Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Ellison is reportedly working with investigators and has admitted to illegal operations across Bankman-Fried’s comingled empire. Co-Founder and former CTO Gary Wang also took a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2022/12/21/ftx-alameda-gary-wang-and-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-fraud/" rel="noopener">plea deal</a> alongside Ellison, per reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors were also investigating former FTX lead engineer Niashad Singh and his role in the company’s activities. A complaint filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/">claimed</a> that Singh wrote code that obscured Alameda’s debts and liabilities on the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenSea, a leading marketplace for digital collectibles and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has announced support for Arbitrum Nova, a Layer 2 blockchain that aims to provide low-cost data availability. </p>



<p>Arbitrum Nova, a new addition to the Arbitrum ecosystem, is intended to be the premier choice for Web3 gaming and social applications. Together with Arbitrum One, which is suitable for DeFi and NFT projects, Arbitrum now offers two mainnet chains that can accommodate a wide range of blockchain use cases.</p>



<p>With this integration, OpenSea users will now be able to access Nova as a more affordable alternative to Ethereum when buying or selling digital collectibles.</p>



<p>In September 2022, OpenSea began supporting Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling network and sister to Nova, which were both created by Offchain Labs.</p>

<p>According to a press release, Nova is a blockchain well-suited for projects with high transaction volumes and cost-sensitive requirements, such as games that frequently mint new items and currency, or social projects with multiple on-chain interaction options. One notable example of its use is the upcoming launch of Reddit Community Points, which will be built on Nova.</p>



<p>Several companies, including Google Cloud, Reddit, FTX, Consensys, P2P, and QuickNode, participated in the launch of Arbitrum Nova as inaugural members of its &#8216;Data Availability Committee&#8217;.</p>
