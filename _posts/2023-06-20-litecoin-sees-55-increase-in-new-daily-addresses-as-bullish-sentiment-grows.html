It works just like Bitcoin in this way as it happens every four years, and creates an environment of scarcity for the cryptocurrency. This is why the halving can be a bullish event for the digital asset. LTC’s next halving is taking place approximately 44 days from now at a block height of 2,520,000. This halving reward will cut block rewards down from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC, and a block is produced on Litecoin approximately every two-and-a-half minutes.
