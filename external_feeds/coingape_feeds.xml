<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/#:~:text=About%20Bitcoin%20(BTC),trading%20volume%20of%20%2410%2C395%2C408%2C577%20USD.">Bitcoin price</a> trades at $26080 and continues to wobble between the two converging trendlines of falling wedge patterns. Despite the recent market sell-off on June 5th and June 10th, the coin price managed to sustain above the lower trendline reflecting the strong accumulation level for buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the falling wedge pattern is a sign of a gradual decrease in selling pressure which leads to a massive bullish upswing. As for now, the converging trendline is narrowed enough to project a no-trading zone.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with the increased negativity in the crypto market, the BTC price may prolong a sideways trend for a few more sessions before an actual breakout.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout will offer traders a long entry opportunity with a potential target of $31170.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will Bitcoin Price Lose $25000?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The support trendline of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">wedge pattern</a> has remained strong despite a highly volatile market scenario. The coin buyers use this support to prevent massive downfall and recuperate the bullish momentum. Therefore, the BTC is likely to plunge below $25000 until this trend is intact.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish alignment between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) accentuates a steady downtrend in Bitcoin price.</span></li>

<h2>Lummis Aims For Crypto Regulation In US</h2>
<p>Working alongside Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Lummis has been working on a revamped bipartisan effort to introduce comprehensive regulations for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>. This legislative endeavor is expected to gain traction on Capitol Hill later this year, paving the way for a much-needed framework in the rapidly evolving digital asset space.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Breaking: Hong Kong Legislator Invites Coinbase To Establish Crypto Operations" href="https://coingape.com/hong-kong-coinbase-apply-for-license-stock-exchange-listing/" rel="bookmark">Hong Kong Legislator Invites Coinbase To Establish Crypto Operations</a></strong></em></p>
<p>While highlighting the fact that the opposition successfully thwarted the inclusion of a <a href="https://coingape.com/biden-proposes-30-climate-change-tax-bitcoin-miners/">30% digital asset mining tax</a> in the recent debt ceiling deal, Lummis emphasized that the fight to establish a clear regulatory landscape for the crypto sector is far from over.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We successfully prevented <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@POTUS</a>&#39; 30% digital asset mining tax from being included in the debt ceiling deal but the fight is far from over.</p>
<p>I am working on a regulatory framework that will allow individuals and companies to own and trade digital assets in America.</p>
<p>Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>&mdash; Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1667573085426384899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Crypto Bill Expected To Address Token Definitions</h2>
<p>Earlier, during a digital assets symposium, Senator Gillibrand stated that the revised version of the bill would be more detailed, particularly in terms of defining tokens and the processes required to obtain them. As stated by the senators multiple times, this move would aim to provide clarity and address existing ambiguities in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the forthcoming bill primarily seeks to define cryptocurrencies while potentially removing the &#8220;security&#8221; tag associated with them. Additionally, the proposed legislation will supposedly impose a universal ban on algorithmic stablecoins although further deliberations are necessary to determine the entities authorized to issue <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/stable-coins/">stablecoins</a> and the requirements associated for maintaining their USD reserves.</p>

However, the downtrend asset found support at the base of the bearish channel, the buyers are absorbing the sell-off neatly. Will Dogecoin reverse from the baseline or is the memecoin set to fall below $0.050?</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin price retests the $0.065 breakdown to test the $0.056 level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying at lower levels leads to tail formation projecting a potential reversal, as buyers absorb the sell-off.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $911.5 Million, indicating a 271% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving in a negatively inclined bearish channel, today the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">dogecoin price</a> approaches the support trend line with an intraday fall of 13.85%. Responding to a recent market sell-off, the meme coin gives a follow-through of a consolidation range fallout between $0.069 and $0.075.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sell-off forms a bearish engulfing candlestick reflecting the high momentum trapped within the range. However, the Dogecoin investors are readily accumulating the coin at lower levels, buying the dip in short. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding points to the bull team, the dog-themed memecoin is bouncing back from the support trendline and the $0.56 level signifying a lower price rejection. At present, the coin trades at $0.059, recovering 13.65% from the day’s low. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing the channel price trend, DOGE will likely bounce back in the coming days if it sustains above the $0.056 level. The reversal will retest the $0.69 level soon as the buyers reclaim their ground. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the sell-off continues, the channel breakdown will prove catastrophic for Doge holders. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Dogecoin Fetch $0.10?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going against the previous analysis of a range breakout on the upside, the memecoin retests the support trendline after the fallout. However, the readiness of buyers to grab dogecoin at lower levels showcases strong trust within the community. This improves the possibility of a bullish reversal. However, Elon Musk’s favorite crypto can face opposition at the $0.069 and $0.075 levels. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>DMI:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The rising ADX showcases high momentum spurge with a huge bearish gap between DI lines indicating a distribution phase in motion. </span></li>

While the exchange has faced significant attention due to the reported outflows, Binance CEO <a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-is-changpeng-zhao-discover-binance-founder-investments/#:~:text=Changpeng%20Zhao%2C%20also%20known%20by,founder%20and%20CEO%20of%20Binance.">Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao</a> took to Twitter to address the issue, stating that the data presented was slightly misleading.</p>
<h2>CZ Refutes Reported Outflows As Inaccurate</h2>
<p>According to CZ, Binance&#8217;s internal data reveals a net outflow of approximately $392 million within the last 24 hours. He pointed out that certain third-party analysis firms determine outflows by measuring changes in Asset Under Management (AUM) in USD equivalent, which includes the impact of crypto price drops. CZ emphasized that this approach may not accurately represent the actual outflows and that it combines two distinct concepts.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a href="https://coingape.com/hong-kong-coinbase-apply-for-license-stock-exchange-listing/">Hong Kong Legislator Invites Coinbase To Establish Crypto Operations</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, the 46-year-old crypto mogul clarified that while crypto price drops reduce AUM, they should not be classified as outflows. While arguing that the public <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wallet-address/">wallet addresses</a> of Binance make it possible for anyone to track the movement of funds, CZ noted that some analysis firms solely measure outflows without considering inflows &#8212; which can lead to a skewed representation of Binance&#8217;s asset movements.</p>
<h2>Impact of Market Fluctuations On AUM</h2>
<p>In addition to all this, CZ shed light on the impact of sharp price movements, such as the significant price drop experienced in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/?utm_source=menubar">crypto market</a> on June 10. He highlighted that on such days, arbitrage traders often transfer a substantial amount of funds between exchanges, resulting in significantly higher activity than on normal days.

<h2>Custodia Case Crucial For Crypto Industry</h2>
<p>In the latest U.S. district court ruling, Judge denied the Federal Reserve’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Custodia bank. However, the court rejected the bank’s request to compel the Fed to grant its master account and membership. Custodia Bank can now pursue its claims through normal channels.</p>
<p>Attorney John Deaton, Amicus curiae in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP lawsuit</a> stated that the Custodia case has arguably become the important case despite Ripple and Coinbase&#8217;s pending cases. Highlighting Chokepoint 2.0 with the failure of multiple banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and other banks, he stated that crypto firms always need banking for on and off ramps. <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>He mentioned that the Custodia Bank holds a very revolutionary idea of not engaging in fractional banking maintaining funds in reserve. The attorney stated that when you have 100% reserves, a bank run becomes a non issue. This is because then there would be no panic about not getting funds or assets out.</p>

<p>Deaton stated that the Federal Reserve doesn’t like the revolutionary concepts. He mentioned that the Fed is ignoring its statutory mandate by denying the Custodia Bank a charter. However, the recent court order will allow the Custodia Bank to move ahead with discovery.</p>
<p>Crypto industry finally received a order in its favor amid the recent crackdown led by the US SEC.</p>

<h2>Xrp(XRP) Price Analysis: Dip Opportunity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/d6AJmTL9.png" alt="Xrp(XRP) Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the increasing selling pressure in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/#:~:text=XRP%20Price%20Trends,tokens%20market%20capitalization%20at%20%2435%2C648%2C476%2C604.72.">XRP price</a> witnessed a minor correction to $0.486 support. Despite the two major sell-offs this month, on June 5th and June 10th, the coin price managed to hold above the $0.486 mark indicating the buyers are defending the newly reclaimed level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price continues to sustain above this level, the buyers are likely to come back and push the price higher to rechallenge the $0.55. The aforementioned resistance is a multi-month resistance that limited bullish growth for over a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, interested traders can look for entry opportunities as the XRP price is at important support, however, the coin holders will obtain a better confirmation of a rally after a decisive breakout from $0.55.</span></p>
<h2><strong>TRON(TRX) Price Analysis: Health Retracement for a Potential Rally</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/A2VJkm3D.png" alt="TRON(TRX) Price Analysis:" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over a two-week period, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/tron/">Tron price</a> experienced a notable correction of 22.4%, declining from its peak of $0.085 to today’s low of $0.0644. However, this pullback is under the 50% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall bullish trend is intact.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the TRX price found support at an ascending trendline carrying the current uptrend. The lower price rejection attached to the daily candle, indicates the buyers are accumulating this altcoin at dips.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buyers manage to sustain above the trendline, the uptrend continuation could lead to the Tron price above $0.0858.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Polkadot(DOT) Price Analysis: Back-to-Bottom Support</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/r4HttDUF.png" alt="Polkadot(DOT) Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an intraday loss of 11.18, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polkadot/#:~:text=DOT%20Price%20Trends%20%3A,trading%20volume%20of%20%24194%2C926%2C034%20USD.">Polkadot coin price</a> plunged back to the December 22’ low of $4.228. However, the daily candle showed long-tail rejection at the long-coming support, indicating the buyers continue to accumulate at this level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously this support triggered the January 2022 rally which peaked nearly 86% higher to hit $7.9</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the market sentiment remains bearish, the DOT price is likely to hover above this support before giving a bullish reversal. A potential reversal from this level could assist buyers to rechallenge the overhead trendline located near $6.</span></p>

<h2><b>XRP Price Daily Chart:</b></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.55 resistance stands as a strong supply zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakdown below the $0.486 support could tumble the XRP price by another 8%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.73 Billion, indicating a 5% gain.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the XRP price shows failed attempts from buyers to surpass the multi-month resistance of $0.55. The green candles showed struggling to offer follow-up candles is a sign of the distribution phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resulting reversal tumbled the coin price by 11% to reach the $0.486 local support. By the press time, the XRP price trades at $0.4886 and currently hovers above the aforementioned support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.486 level stands as strong support as during the sell-off on June 5th, the buyers manage to take support at the aforementioned level. Until this leave is intact, the overall recovery sentiment will remain intact.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below the $0.486 support could prolong the correction and plunge the XRP price by 8% to hit the $0.447 mark.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will XRP Price Plunge to $0.45?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing supply pressure at $0.55 pressurizes the XRP price for a bearish reversal. The resulting downfall hit the next significant demand zone of the $0.486 mark. The daily chart shows the aforementioned level aligned with the 50-day EMA and the 50% retracement level creates a strong accumulation and less likely of a breakdown. </span></p>

In a Twitter post, Legislative Council member Johnny Ng expressed his willingness to provide assistance and hinted at possible stock listing plans for crypto trading operators, including <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>. This move comes after the US SEC went on a crypto carnage this week with subsequent <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/">lawsuits</a> filed against crypto heavyweights like Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Embraces Crypto Regulations<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>While many countries in the West remain cautious about <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>, Hong Kong has taken a different approach by actively regulating crypto assets. In 2023, the city&#8217;s Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, announced the government&#8217;s commitment to building a robust crypto and fintech ecosystem. Since then, Hong Kong has been proactively developing regulations and compliance measures to foster the growth of the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s pro-crypto stance has attracted attention from global tech giants. In January, Samsung, the Korean tech giant, announced the launch of a Bitcoin Futures Active ETF on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Moreover, in mid-February, reports emerged that Chinese officials were providing strategic approval to Hong Kong&#8217;s pro-crypto efforts.</p>
<p>It is even speculated that the Chinese government might eventually consider using Hong Kong as a test bed for crypto innovation, as long as it does not pose a threat to the country&#8217;s financial stability. This endorsement further solidified Hong Kong&#8217;s reputation as a leading crypto-friendly jurisdiction in the region.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Lays Foundation For Retail CBDC</h2>
<p>In the latest development, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced on June 9 its plans to lay the foundation for implementing a retail <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/">Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</a>. The move aims to explore the potential benefits of CBDCs as a payment method for day-to-day transactions and for easy onboarding of customers onto <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>The invitation extended by Legislative Council member Johnny Ng signals the country&#8217;s commitment to becoming a digital hub for the crypto industry, which has already seen participation from both OKX and Huobi compliance entities and are currently listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. At the time of writing, the California-based Coinbase exchange has not provided a response to the proposal yet.</p>

<h2><b>Details About the FTX Verdict</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As revealed in a </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://apnews.com/article/ftx-cryptocurrency-bankmanfried-bankruptcy-e3a4c8729d3f3f3c22724247104c337b"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the Associated Press, the ruling follows a two-day hearing in which media outlets and the United States Bankruptcy Trustee opposed FTX&#8217;s plea to keep customer and creditor names hidden. This decision marks a significant development in the intersection of privacy, finance, and cryptocurrency, as it sets a precedent for customer protection in the event of future bankruptcies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">FTX, a once prominent player in the crypto market, filed for bankruptcy after </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-sam-bankman-fried-faces-investigations-amid-new-bail-restrictions/"><span style="font-weight: 400">facing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> financial difficulties last year. As part of its bankruptcy proceedings, the exchange sought to protect the privacy of its customers by keeping their identities confidential. FTX argued that disclosing customer names could expose their personal information and potentially lead to misuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time, some media outlets </span><a href="https://coingape.com/top-media-demands-court-to-release-data-of-9m-ftx-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400">contested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the notion that potential risks to customers outweigh the public&#8217;s right to access bankruptcy filings and information. The outlets also emphasize that foreign laws do not typically prohibit the disclosure of customer identities in bankruptcy court proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, the media outlets argue that the demand for secrecy should not be sufficient justification for redaction. The media outlets claim that if the court accepts such a premise, it will set a precedent of sealing personal information in all circumstances when people want privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in the recent ruling, Judge John Dorsey dismissed all arguments and highlighted that customer identities are a trade secret. He also stated that FTX clients must be protected from criminal actors who may target them by searching the internet and the “dark web” for personal information.</span></p>
<h2><b>FTX Latest Ruling Reveals a Balance Between Transparency and Privacy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the court&#8217;s ruling in favor of FTX raises important questions about the balance between transparency and privacy in the cryptocurrency industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While transparency is crucial for establishing trust and accountability, Judge Dorsey argues that individuals have the right to maintain their anonymity in crypto transactions. Overall, this ruling recognizes the significance of safeguarding customer privacy in the evolving landscape of digital finance.</span></p>

This comes after the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC</a>) targeting top US based crypto exchange Coinbase with charges of violating securities laws in the country. However, it is argued that the SEC was informed about the same operations when it approved Coinbase&#8217;s IPO in 2019.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the US SEC had mentioned at the time in its documentation that the IPO approval does not necessarily prevent it from charging businesses over violations in operations. Meanwhile, the crypto trading community went through a shock with the back to back lawsuits against two of the world&#8217;s top crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Politician Invites Coinbase To Apply For Crypto License</h2>
<p>Contrary to the regulatory environment in the United States, Hong Kong leader Johnny Ng had on Saturday wrote an <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Johnny_nkc/status/1667499874521350144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open invitation</a> to the likes of Coinbase and other crypto trading operators to come and apply for regulatory licenses in the region.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I hereby offer an invitation to welcome all global virtual asset trading operators including Coinbase to come to HK for application of official trading platforms and further development plans. Please feel free to approach me and I am happy to provide any assistance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Hong Kong made <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/crypto-price-analysis-prices-skyrocket-for-top-3-china-coins-hong-kong-opens-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> by allowing retail investors to trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies. As a result, there has been a rise in demand for some of the Chinese crypto coins, although not as much as anticipated.</p>

The total liquidation comes in at $400 million over the last 24hrs as over 190,000 traders were liquidated. The largest single liquidation happened on the crypto exchange OKX, with ETH-USD-SWAP valued at $2.18 million.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price tumbles 4%, with major downfall coming within just 2 hours. <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> fell to a 24-hour low of $25,500. Bitcoin currently trades near $25600, with a high probability of falling below the $25k level.</p>

<p>Altcoins such as Filecoin, Polygon, Cardano, Solana, Chiliz, Sandbox, Decentraland, Axie Infinity, and others fell more than 25%. Shiba Inu (SHIB) lead the crypto market crash, falling 30% in the last 24 hours. Some buying from the dip is also recorded.</p>

<h2>Reasons Behind the Crypto Market Crash</h2>
<p>Major liquidations were recorded in the cryptocurrencies mentioned in the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-defies-us-sec-bitcoin-ethereum-and-coinbase-coin-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US SEC lawsuits</a> against Coinbase and Binance. However, the massive liquidation came in response to Binance.US stopping USD fiat support on the exchange and <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-robinhood-becomes-first-exchange-to-delist-ada-matic-and-sol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood delisting</a> Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC).</p>
<p>US SEC mentioned BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI as securities in the Binance lawsuit. The agency listed SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO as securities in the Coinbase lawsuit.</p>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinglass</a>, over $300 million in longs and $30 million in shorts were liquidated in the last 24 hours. The liquidations majorly happened on Binance, OKX, and Bybit, with BTC ($50M), ETH ($46M), ADA ($17M), SOL ($16M), LTC ($12M), DOGE ($11M), BNB (10M), FIL ($10M), and MATIC ($9M).</p>

Source: Coinglass</figcaption></figure>
<p>Grayscale Investments has also filed a request with the US SEC seeking withdrawal of the Trust’s Registration Statement on Form 10 for Grayscale Filecoin Trust. The SEC staff continues to view Filecoin (FIL) as security. However, Grayscale says it will continue to believe that FIL is not a security.</p>
<p>Market makers such as Jump Crypto and Cumberland have pulled all the liquidity from altcoins. Market makers were caught dumping major crypto to exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Binance.US partners are reluctant to work with the exchange, causing a major selloff across the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, over <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-news-4-trillion-shib-worth-32-million-moved-to-binance-price-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 trillion Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB) tokens worth millions were moved from Shiba Staking to crypto exchange Binance. It triggered a selloff in <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHIB</a> and BONE prices.</p>
<p>Scimitar Capital, the hedge fund rumored to be behind the massive $2 billion altcoin liquidation, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ScimitarCapital/status/1667422106017996804" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>

<p>Although staking does not imply LUNC removal from circulation forever, but it helps boost LUNC price and increase Terra Classic network security. It also promotes Terra Luna Classic and gives confidence to validators on the chain.</p>
<p>In addition, the Terra Luna Classic community also burns LUNC to reduce the circulating supply. The total LUNC tokens burned by the community has reached over 63 billion. The community has burned over 2 billion LUNC as of June 10, with <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-burns-billion-terra-classic-lunc-tokens-price-jumps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance sending 1.04 LUNC</a> to the burn address. The LUNC burn rate has also increased in the second quarter.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price to Rally With This Major News</h2>
<p>Terra Luna Classic core developer <strong>Joint L1 Task Force (L1TF) </strong>started preparing for the <strong>v2.1.0 Parity upgrade</strong> as the community has passed the proposal.</p>
<p>The v2.1.0 upgrade is the biggest upgrade and contains features including minimum 5% commission for validators, CosmWasm v1.1.0, and two security updates. Other changes include WasmVM upgrade to v1.1.2, Wasmd upgrade for multichain capability, IBC go v4.3.1, and bug fixes.</p>

<p>LUNC price fell 12% today after the market-wide selloff and remains the only crypto in green this week. The price currently trading at $0.000086, with the 24-hour low and high are $0.000080 and $0.000101, respectively. However, the LUNC price is likely to rebound after the Parity upgrade on June 14.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cry &#8216;Havoc!&#8217; and let slip the Doges of war.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cry &#39;Havoc!&#39; and let slip the Doges of war</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1667324871410585600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is unclear what the basis of this tweet was or what the intention was but the community has reacted to the tweet just as every other one that has emanated from the biggest Dogecoin advocate. Since the tweet was shared in the early hours of today, it has generated more than 13.3 million views with a very decent number of reactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on </span><a href="https://coingape.com/dogecoin-traders-await-back-to-back-elon-musk-news-doge-price/"><span style="font-weight: 400">precedence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, this tweet and the reaction it has generated is enough to drive a bullish run in the price of the memecoin. However, at the time of writing, there has been no visible positive price surge for the cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dogecoin is currently changing hands at a spot price of $0.05966, down by 15.41% over the past 24 hours. The memecoin has joined the hoard of altcoins with a very bearish outlook over the past week where it has dropped 17.71%.</span></p>
<h2><b>Beyond Elon Musk: Can the Market Get Reliable Triggers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the failure of Dogecoin to recover following the tweet from Elon Musk, it has become obvious that the broader market needs more definitive triggers to chart a new and sustained recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the current outlook, the market may not be seeing such triggers as the negative sentiment is yet to be cleared. The </span><a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400">lawsuits launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase Exchange earlier in the week appear to be having more negative repercussions for the indicted tokens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of such negative moves is the decision by brokerage platform Robinhood to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ada-sol-and-matic-tank-10-each-after-robinhood-delisting-will-more-exchanges-follow/"><span style="font-weight: 400">delist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the trio of Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) by the end of this month following their securities tag by the SEC. The market is yet to chart a recovery as the fears of more delisting actions from exchanges is still hanging in the air.</span></p>

Web3 has the ability to bring a huge paradigm change and create an enhanced impact while overcoming the limitations of Web2. Web3 deploys technologies like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a>, machine learning and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain technology</a>. Moreover, the data and privacy of the users will enhance, thanks to blockchain technologies&#8217; decentralized nature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the introduction of Web3 social media platforms, the issues regarding the use of Web2 social media platforms have been addressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized networks and blockchain technology provide individuals or organizations control over their data and online activities, thus making Web3 social media sites highly secure.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, we present you with a list of some of the top Web3 social media sites to look forward to in 2023. But before that, let us have a comprehensive overview of Web3 social networks. </span></p>
<h2><b>Web3 Social Networks: An Overview</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web3 social networks aims to foster community development and information exchange through decentralized, participatory platforms. Web3 social media platforms emphasize providing complete freedom and control for users to produce and distribute content as they want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of decentralized platforms and complete ownership of data, users are free from corporate grip and have the full right to decide whether to monetize their content or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web2 social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, etc. brought people together. Web3 will play more attention to user privacy issues, data ownership issues, and censorship. Decentralization is ensured via independent servers as opposed to centralized databases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Web3 platforms utilize token awards to safeguard the data that is stored on blockchains. Web3 social media platforms also enable artists to tokenize their material into <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFTs</a> for revenue, which allows for more dynamic socializing. You may utilize all of Web3 social media&#8217;s features while maintaining a higher level of privacy and security.</span></p>

Major cryptocurrencies, including Polygon&#8217;s MATIC, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL), experienced <a href="https://coingape.com/ada-sol-and-matic-tank-10-each-after-robinhood-delisting-will-more-exchanges-follow/">double-digit losses</a> overnight, while Bitcoin&#8217;s decline was relatively modest compared to its <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> counterparts.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Exchange Outflows Hit 1-Month High</h2>
<p>According to Glassnode&#8217;s on-chain data, Bitcoin&#8217;s Exchange Outflow Volume (7d MA) has surged to a 1-month high of $39,781,339.94. This figure surpassed the previous 1-month high of $39,556,958.79, recorded on June 9, 2023. The term &#8220;exchange outflow&#8221; refers to the total amount of Bitcoin being withdrawn from <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> wallets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-151402" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10191319/FyQrsv0WAAE7ZdZ1.jpeg" alt="" width="2400" height="1200" /></p>
<p>This trend follows a recent wave of users moving their crypto assets away from exchanges, which have faced legal action from the SEC. As reported earlier on CoinGape, the federal agency filed <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/">lawsuits</a> against Coinbase and <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/binance-exchange-review/">Binance exchange</a>, two prominent players in the crypto industry.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Breaking: Cathie Wood Predicts Bitcoin’s Price To Reach $1Mn By 2030" href="https://coingape.com/cathie-wood-bitcoin-price-prediction-1-million-by-2030/" rel="bookmark">Cathie Wood Predicts Bitcoin’s Price To Reach $1Mn By 2030</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Typically, investors withdraw their BTC from exchanges to hold them in offsite wallets for extended periods. This behavior leads to a shortage of supply, especially considering the growing demand for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. Therefore, it generally turns out to be a bullish signal for the crypto asset as the selling pressure on BTC also subsides gradually.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Resilient Price Action Amid Market Turmoil</h2>
<p>In contrast to the market turmoil, recent data indicates that Bitcoin hodlers, who prefer to hold onto the asset rather than seek quick profits, have remained resolute. Glassnode&#8217;s data reveals that these investors continue to accumulate BTC at a rate of 37,400 tokens per month. This accumulation suggests a strong belief in the long-term value and potential of Bitcoin.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-151397 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/10185858/FyQXsGNWIAQPTOs-638219965186810827.jpeg" alt="bitcoin exchange outflo" width="1200" height="691" /></p>
<p>As of the time of writing, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price of Bitcoin</a> is being traded at $25,627, representing a 4% drop in the past 24 hours. In comparison, the flagship cryptocurrency experienced a 5.67% decline over the previous seven days.</p>

As a result, the market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum tumbled 2.5% and 6.5% on intraday levels respectively. Amid this downfall, the ETH price lost crucial monthly support of $1775-$1765 indicating the coin holders could experience an extended correction.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Ethereum Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish breakdown below the $1765 support sets the ETH price on a 5.5% loss</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term trend for Ethereum stays bullish as long as the support trendline is intact;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.6 Billion, indicating a 0.27% loss.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> price showcased a high momentum breakdown from the $1775-$1765 support level. Losing this last swing low support hints the ETH price may prolong the ongoing correction phase.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the daily candle closes below the $1765 support the selling pressure will accelerate and offer trades the opportunity to short sell. With sustained selling the coin price will tumble 5.5% to hit the long-coming support trendline.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, a retest to this support trendline triggered a significant recovery in the ETH price, validating this level as a crucial accumulation zone. Therefore, potential traders must mark this dynamic support if looking for a dip opportunity.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Ethereum Price Reach $1700?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intense sell-off today backed by high volume indicates the sellers have a strong conviction to take the Ethereum price lower. With the breakdown of $1775-$1765 support, the coin price will more likely plunge to the next significant support of $1700, followed by the combined support of $1650 and ascending trendline.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Average Directional Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uptick in the daily ADX slope assures sufficient strength in sellers to carry further downfall.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A downtick in the lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">BB indicator</a> accentuates high momentum selling in the market.</span></li>

Notably, the US Congress, responsible for shaping the country&#8217;s legislative framework, has been actively engaged in drafting a new crypto bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of Circle, a leading blockchain technology company behind the USDC stablecoin believes that Congress is making significant strides in this light. He recently expressed his optimism about the ongoing crypto bill discussions by lawmakers, stating that material progress is being made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allaire highlighted on </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1667288466147737602"><span style="font-weight: 400">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that Congress has announced an upcoming major hearing for next Tuesday focused on the Future of Digital Assets and Regulatory Clarity. Additionally, he revealed that a newly published draft of the US Stablecoin Bill has also been published, which shows significant progress between the Financial Services Committee and the Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee. </span></p>

<h2><b>Key Issues Raised in the Draft Crypto Bill</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Allaire, the recently published draft of the US Stablecoin Bill represents significant progress on several crucial issues that are integral to the regulation of stablecoins and digital assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The draft addresses key areas, including Federal Reserve standards and rules, custody and consumer protection, treatment of algorithmic stablecoins, interoperability standards, and rules facilitating banks&#8217; expansion into digital asset custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remarkably, the draft bill aims to address these concerns by strengthening the role of federal regulators while preserving the existing dual-banking system model, which involves the participation of state regulators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to addressing the role of federal regulators and preserving the dual-banking system model, the proposed bill also acknowledges the importance of strong custody procedures for stablecoin issuers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">By introducing significant and expanded language in these areas, the bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers to ensure the safety, security, and integrity of consumer funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, Allaire noted that the US Stablecoin Bill presents a significant opportunity for the United States to take the lead in establishing policies that drive global adoption of digital dollars.</span></p>

The cumulative market cap dropped by more than 5% after registering a broad recovery over the past day. <a href="https://coingape.com/companies/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> CEO, Changpeng Zhao addressed the current market situation amid facing legal complications.</p>

<h2>Long Position Liquidations Lead Crypto Crash</h2>
<p>As per the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinglass data</a>, more than 184k traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours. The total liquidation registered comes in at $387 million. Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto witnessed most of the liquidation (approx worth $50 million) over the past day.</p>
<p>Data depicts that out of the cumulative liquidation of $387 million, 88% of the liquidation (approx worth $343 million) turns out to be long positions. While just $43 million worth of shorts were liquidated. This suggests that traders were betting on the market gains. However, Binance registered $151 million worth liquidation in the last 24 hours, where $129 million worth of long positions were liquidated.</p>
<p>The digital asset market witnessed a broad sell off as the biggest cryptos like Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL) prices dropped by a massive 25% and 22%, respectively. <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Crypto News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<h2>CZ Dispersing FUD?</h2>
<p>Changpeng Zhao, Binance Chief addressed the crypto crash stating that no one really knows why the market is going up or down.

<p>He mentioned the second narrative making rounds on social media which claims that $1.3 billion of altcoins on Robinhood could be sold. However, CZ added that he have no idea about that.</p>

The preposition that <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-crackdown-memecoin-craze-pepecoin-price-surges/">SEC crackdown may restore memecoin frenzy</a> again is under question, PEPE once reaching an all-time high of $0.00000431, has experienced a significant decline of 78.12% within the span of just one month.</p>
<h2>Whale Transaction Details</h2>
<p>A whale incurred a 52% loss as they sold 468.5 billion PEPE tokens for 109 ETH ($190,000) and 237.5 thousand $USDT just two hours ago.</p>
<p>Two hours ago, the whale executed a sale of <strong>468.5 billion PEPE</strong>, receiving<strong> 109 ETH</strong> valued at $190,000 and <strong>237.5k $USDT</strong>. Unfortunately, this transaction resulted in a significant loss for the whale.</p>
<p>On <strong>May 9</strong>, the whale withdrew 468.5 billion PEPE tokens, worth approximately $890,000, from the <strong>KuCoin exchange</strong>. At the time of withdrawal, the price of PEPE was $0.0000019. The transaction can be traced back to the wallet address 0x817c4546ec90dd16436d85ba11fb2ecaa1278594a7a56d4cbc45c1b3b408531b.</p>
<p>It has been 32 days and 13 hours since the withdrawal from KuCoin, with the tokens being transferred to the address 0x4322FD&#8230;4b4C3708. The total amount transferred was 468,495,834,335.1138 PEPE tokens.</p>
<h3>PEPE Price Plummets, Loss Incurred</h3>
<p>As a result of this transaction, the whale may have incurred a loss of $463,000, representing a significant 52% decline in value. The PEPE token has experienced a 29.25% decrease in price over the past seven days, with the current price standing at $0.0000009442.</p>
<p>When memecoin hype was over the moon, big whales like Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother purchased 6 billion PEPE tokens for $12,000 USD.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/popular-whale-acquires-66b-pepe-tokens-in-just-03-days/">Read CoinGape&#8217;s Coverage Of Whales Buying PEPE..</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/pepe-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pepecoin price</a> rose steadily in late April and went on to explode on May 5, when<a href="https://coingape.com/binance-expands-support-for-pepe-and-floki-price-to-rally/"> Binance announced listing</a> of the meme coin. Even popular exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/gemini-lists-pepe-meme-coin-after-binance-analyst-predicts-major-price-rally/">Gemini announched PEPE listing</a> few days post Binance, leading to a price rally.</p>
<p>This dramatic shift in price reflects the extreme volatility and rapid fluctuations that can occur in the cryptocurrency market, especoally with pump and dump schemes of memecoins. Community is suggested to underscore the need for careful analysis and risk management when engaging in trading activities.</p>

Sam replied that “it’s pretty hopeless.” The video clip circulated on Indian social media as Sam seemed to completely dismiss the idea of Indian companies competing with American counterparts on AI.</p>
<h2>Tech Mahindra CEO Accepts Sam Altman’s challenge</h2>
<p>Responding to Sam Altman’s Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/C_P_Gurnani/status/1667140990413537284"> accepted the challenge</a> put forth by OpenAI CEO that Indian companies could not match the AI skill set of their American counterparts.</p>
<p>Replying to the question posed by Rajan Anandan, former Google India head and currently a venture capitalist, Sam Altman said, &#8220;The way this works is we&#8217;re going to tell you, it&#8217;s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation models you shouldn&#8217;t try, and it&#8217;s your job to like try anyway. And I believe both of those things. I think it is pretty hopeless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anandan later <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/RajanAnandan/status/1666641010284449792">tweeted</a>, “Thank you, Sam Altman, for the clear answer. As you said, &#8216;it is hopeless, but you will try anyway.&#8217; 5000 years of Indian entrepreneurship has shown us that we should never underestimate the Indian entrepreneur. We do intend to try.”</p>
<h2>“I think it’s the wrong question”</h2>
<p>Replying to Tech Mahindra CEO’s tweet, Sam <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1667475932934983680">said</a> that it is really taken out of context. Adding, “the question was about competing with us with $10 million, which i really do think is not going to work. But I still said try! however, I think it’s the wrong question.” In another tweet, OpenAI CEO wrote, “the right question is what a startup can do that’s never been done before, that will contribute a new thing to the world. I have no doubt Indian startups can and will do that! and no one but the builders can answer that question.”</p>
