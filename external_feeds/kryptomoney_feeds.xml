<p>The NFT marketplace <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/opensea-set-for-solana-integration-in-april/">OpenSea</a> has decided to discontinue support for one of its blockchains. OpenSea will no longer facilitate NFTs built on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The rationale behind this move is attributed to the necessity of channeling resources toward the most promising initiatives.<br /><br />OpenSea <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1692598153244020776?t=1meQD4Nzls-eh4hGHb_CKA&amp;s=19">stated</a> on social media that the company assessed that the benefits of continuing to support BSC were outweighed by the broader impact.<br /><br />Effective immediately, users will be unable to create new listings for BSC NFTs or initiate new offers related to them. Nevertheless, OpenSea clarified that individuals will retain the ability to view, discover, and transfer BSC NFTs on the platform. The decision is anticipated to optimize resource allocation, enabling OpenSea to stay in step with the rapid advancements within its ecosystem.<br /><br />As a result of this change, OpenSea&#8217;s list of supported blockchains is now narrowed down to 10: Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Base, Ethereum, Klaytn, Optimism, Polygon, Solana and Zora.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/bnb-chain-reopens-operations-following-2-million-token-exploit/">BNB Smart Chain</a>, previously recognized as Binance Smart Chain, functions as a Layer 1 blockchain stemming from the renowned cryptocurrency exchange Binance.<br /><br />This move by OpenSea underscores the company&#8217;s strategic approach to aligning its efforts with blockchain networks that exhibit considerable potential and fostering innovation within its ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.crypto-law.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SEC-Motion-for-Appeal.pdf">submitted</a> a memorandum of law seeking permission to appeal the court order issued on July 13 regarding Ripple. In tandem with this development, XRP&#8217;s price has seen a decline of over 13% within the past 24 hours, as per data from CoinGecko. The focus of the appeal centers on two key aspects: firstly, the determination that Ripple&#8217;s XRP offers and sales on crypto trading platforms would not lead investors to anticipate profits based on the efforts of others; secondly, the assessment that Ripple&#8217;s distribution of XRP as a form of service payment does not satisfy the definition of an &#8220;investment of money&#8221; by the precedent established by SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.<br /><br />The <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/ripples-victory-over-sec-in-lawsuit-whats-next/">SEC</a> highlights the essential nature of these rulings, asserting that they address fundamental legal questions. It&#8217;s noteworthy that a different district court has already expressed disagreement with the initial verdict about Ripple, thus underscoring the necessity for a comprehensive appellate review. Ripple&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, recently downplayed the significance of this decision.<br /><br />At the heart of the legal conflict lies the question of whether Ripple&#8217;s offers and sales of XRP qualify as &#8220;investment contracts&#8221; in line with the criteria set forth by the Howey test. While the court recognized that the Howey criteria were met in the context of institutional sales, discrepancies have arisen concerning the classification of coins sold directly to institutional investors versus those sold to retail investors via secondary markets.<br /><br />The ongoing legal battle has garnered significant attention from industry leaders and experts within the cryptocurrency sphere. The SEC&#8217;s motion to appeal underscores the significance of establishing clarity within the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/why-ripple-lawsuit-may-not-settle-here-are-expectations-of-ripple-ceo-and-legal-experts-as-ruling-looms/">Ripple</a> aims to affirm the court&#8217;s decision from July, while the SEC contends that an interlocutory review could yield the necessary clarity and thus urges an immediate appeal. The outcome of this motion holds the potential to shape the trajectory of similar cases in the cryptocurrency domain, thereby making it a closely monitored event for stakeholders and investors alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/dogecoin-spikes-on-spacex-news-heres-the-likely-timing-for-summary-judgment-in-ripple-lawsuit-per-recent-updates/">SpaceX</a>, the space venture led by Elon Musk, reportedly recorded a decrease in the value of its Bitcoin holdings by a total of $373 million in both 2020 and 2021, as per the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/behind-the-curtain-of-elon-musks-secretive-spacex-revenue-growth-and-rising-costs-2c828e2b"> report</a> on Thursday.</p>
<p>The publication referred to documents that offered a rare insight into the financials of the aerospace company.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal also indicated that SpaceX had engaged in the sale of Bitcoin, although the exact amount sold and the timing of the sales were not specified in the report.</p>
<p>Elon Musk acknowledged in a discussion in 2021 that SpaceX possessed Bitcoin. However, the precise quantity of Bitcoin owned by the company remained undisclosed due to SpaceX&#8217;s private nature.</p>
<p>Notably, <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/tesla-stops-receiving-bitcoin-payments-considers-other-crypto-assets-as-payment-alternatives/">Tesla</a>, another company helmed by Musk and renowned for its electric vehicles, also held bitcoin. During the same event in 2021, Musk revealed that Tesla had allocated $1.5 billion to Bitcoin as part of the company&#8217;s balance sheet strategy.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Tesla divested itself of approximately $936 million worth of Bitcoin. Musk&#8217;s affinity for cryptocurrencies has been evident over the years; he notably incorporated the logo of the popular meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin, represented by the symbol &#8220;Ð,&#8221; in his X social media page&#8217;s bio. His social media posts about various tokens have been known to significantly influence their market prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/tethers-usdt-now-supported-by-strike-for-payments/">Tether</a>, a prominent stablecoin provider, revealed its decision to discontinue support for its USDT token on three blockchains where the token had not gained significant traction. The affected blockchains include Bitcoin&#8217;s Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), and Kusama.<br /><br />Tether outlined its rationale on its <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-makes-strategic-transition-to-meet-community-demands-and-foster-innovation/">website</a>, emphasizing that community interest plays a pivotal role in determining whether the company will bring USDT to a specific blockchain. The company stated that if a blockchain doesn&#8217;t exhibit substantial activity over an extended period and doesn&#8217;t show signs of usage recovery, continuing support becomes inefficient and may compromise security and oversight.<br /><br />One of the affected blockchains, Omni Layer, was established approximately a decade ago as a smart contract layer built on top of Bitcoin, enabling smart contracts and tokenization on the network. Omni played a crucial role in Tether&#8217;s early journey, serving as the &#8220;first transport layer&#8221; for USDT in 2014. However, challenges emerged over time due to the absence of popular tokens and the preference of crypto exchanges for other layers like Ethereum and Tron.<br /><br />Tether expressed the possibility of reconsidering USDT support for Omni if the decentralized exchange and token issuance protocol of Omni&#8217;s network experienced increased utilization in the future.<br /><br />While Tether is discontinuing support for USDT on Omni, it has not abandoned Bitcoin altogether. The company is now planning to issue USDT on RGB, an alternative smart contract system that leverages Bitcoin&#8217;s base layer and the lightning network to achieve unparalleled scalability. Tether believes that RGB holds the potential to usher in a new era for digital assets, smart contracts, and digital rights.<br /><br />Although the minting of USDT on these discontinued chains has ceased, holders of USDT on these platforms will still be able to redeem their tokens for the next 12 months. Additionally, they can trade their tokens on exchanges, such as Bitfinex, for assets on other supported chains.<br /><br />While the Omni blockchain struggled to gain adoption, the broader crypto ecosystem has witnessed various initiatives for Bitcoin-based stablecoins.<br /><br />Notably, Stably launched the first <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/stablecoin-face-supply-crunch-amid-rising-adoption/">stablecoin</a> on Bitcoin&#8217;s base layer using the BRC-20 token standard in May, showcasing ongoing efforts to innovate within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto security firm <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1691798467520139338">Ledger</a> has unveiled an integration that empowers customers in the United States to conveniently purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin using their PayPal accounts. In an official statement, the Paris-based blockchain company announced that users of its Ledger Live app in the US will have the opportunity, subject to &#8220;applicable state law,&#8221; to buy cryptocurrencies without the need for additional verification if they have previously acquired digital assets via PayPal.</p>
<p>Highlighting a shared commitment to secure and swift transactions, Pascal Gauthier, Chairman and CEO of Ledger, emphasized the collaborative effort between Ledger and PayPal to provide users with a seamless experience regardless of their geographical location. Gauthier noted, &#8220;Ledger is committed to simplifying the world of crypto and PayPal is committed to making the movement of money as simple, reliable, and affordable as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Ledger and <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/paypal-sees-record-high-crypto-deposits-reaching-943m/">PayPal</a> have been actively broadening their involvement in the cryptocurrency space. PayPal recently introduced a stablecoin specific to the US market, while Ledger launched Tradelink, a trading network tailored for institutional players.</p>
<p>Having been established in 2014 and renowned for its hardware wallets, Ledger stands as one of Europe&#8217;s prominent crypto enterprises. This latest integration between Ledger and PayPal underlines the ongoing efforts to enhance accessibility and convenience for individuals looking to enter the crypto market through well-established platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The momentum of the<a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/coinbase-fights-back-against-secs-crypto-custody-plan/"> Coinbase</a> rally has hit a roadblock, witnessing a decline of over 28% from its yearly peak in July, which had briefly surged beyond $110. This cryptocurrency exchange, which experienced a surge in share prices leading up to the release of its<a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/Shareholder-Letter-Q2-2023.pdf"> second-quarter earnings</a> earlier this month, has seen an 11% dip over the past week. On Wednesday, shares displayed minimal movement, increasing by 0.1% to $79.28 at 1:27 p.m. ET, according to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-COIN/">TradingView</a> data.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Coinbase managed to maintain a bullish trajectory through much of June and July. This was partly attributed to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/coinbase-surges-after-cboe-names-crypto-exchange-bitcoin-etf-application-2023-07-03/">news</a> that the company was collaborating with various asset management firms to roll out spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s positive earnings<a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/Shareholder-Letter-Q2-2023.pdf"> report</a> on August 3 further bolstered its position. However, the specifics regarding the potential revenue that the new<a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-would-be-extremely-lucrative-according-to-bloomberg-expert/"> spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> could generate for the company remained undisclosed. Additionally, agreements with exchange platforms Cboe and Nasdaq for market surveillance sharing were contingent on the SEC&#8217;s approval of the funds.</p>
<p>Emilie Choi, the Chief Operating Officer, outlined Coinbase&#8217;s monetization strategy, emphasizing near-term revenue from AUCCs (Assets Under Custody and Control). She also highlighted the company&#8217;s anticipation of ancillary revenue streams from settlement and other services. Choi&#8217;s optimism is rooted in the belief that the introduction of spot ETFs would expand the cryptocurrency market and bring positive outcomes, considering these products are still navigating the registration and approval process.</p>
<p>Analysts tracking Coinbase&#8217;s stock have raised their price targets for the company since late June. Approximately 32% advocate a buy or overweight rating for COIN, while around 29% maintain a sell rating.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s stock performance has unfolded against the backdrop of a relatively sluggish crypto market, marked by historically low volatility for<a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-btc-to-break-equilibrium-and-trigger-volatility-glassnode/"> Bitcoin</a> and significantly reduced trading volumes compared to 2020. The seven-day moving average for spot exchange volumes plummeted to $11.2 billion on August 15, a stark decline from the over $46 billion seen in March. This scenario poses challenges for platforms like Coinbase, which derive a substantial portion of their revenue from trading fees.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Coinbase&#8217;s total transaction revenue reached $327.1 million, constituting around 46% of the overall revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online casino betting is a popular way to place bets on your favorite games. It involves betting on a specific outcome in a game and, with luck and strategy, can lead to big wins. Most online casinos offer free play options, so you can try out different <a href="https://www.ace969.com/sg/en-us/">online gambling Singapore</a> games before committing any real money. This gives you an idea of how much you can win and how fun the games are to play.</p>
<p>The best online casinos are those that allow players to play in their own currency, accept major credit cards and e-wallets like PayPal, and offer secure encryption for player data. Some also have live chat and phone support. The best sites also have high payout percentages and are licensed and regulated. They should also have an extensive library of games and a good reputation among players.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Online Casino Betting That Every Player Should Know</h2>
<p><strong>Convenience</strong>: One of the biggest advantages of online betting sites is the convenience that they offer. Users can place bets from anywhere at any time using an internet-connected device, such as a computer or mobile phone. This eliminates the need to travel to a physical location, such as a casino or sportsbook, saving users time and money.</p>
<p><strong>Better Odds</strong>: Another advantage of online betting sites is that they often offer better odds than traditional brick-and-mortar establishments. This is because online sites have lower overhead costs, which allows them to offer more favorable odds to users. Additionally, users can shop around and compare odds from different sites to find the best value for their bets.</p>
<p><strong>Wide Selection of Games and Sports</strong>: Online betting sites typically offer a much wider selection of games and sports to bet on than traditional establishments. Users can choose from a variety of sports, such as football, basketball, and tennis, as well as a wide range of casino games, such as slots, blackjack, and roulette. This allows users to find the games and sports that they are most interested in and to try out new games without having to travel to a physical location.</p>
<p><strong>Bonuses and Promotions</strong>: Many online betting sites offer bonuses and promotions to users, such as free bets, <a href="https://www.atebits.com/what-is-casino-credit/">online casino free credit</a>, deposit bonuses, and cashback offers. These promotions can help users to get more value for their bets and to try out new games without having to risk their own money.</p>
<p><strong>Live Betting and Streaming</strong>: Online betting sites often offer live betting and streaming options, which allow users to place bets in real-time and to watch the action unfold live. This adds an extra layer of excitement to the betting experience and allows users to stay up-to-date with the latest scores and results.</p>
<p><strong>Safety and Security</strong>: Online betting sites use advanced encryption and security measures to protect users&#8217; personal and financial information. This ensures that users can gamble online with peace of mind, knowing that their information is safe and secure.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility and Control</strong>: Online betting sites allow users to have more flexibility and control over their bets. Users can place bets of any size, from small wagers to large bets, and can choose from a variety of different betting options, such as point spreads, moneylines, and over/under bets.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Information and Statistics</strong>: Online betting sites often provide users with access to a wealth of information and statistics about different sports and games. This can help users to make more informed betting decisions and to increase their chances of winning.</p>
<p><strong>Social Interaction</strong>: <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/is-crypto-betting-safe/">Online betting</a> sites often have social features, such as chat rooms and forums, which allow users to interact with each other and share tips and advice. This can help users to feel more connected to the betting community and to learn from other users&#8217; experiences and strategies.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Online gambling is a growing industry with a huge variety of games and betting options. These include online poker, bingo, and lottery games as well as a range of casino and sports bets. There are even a number of mobile apps available to make the process of gambling on the go easier and more convenient.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar casinos, online casinos are able to offer more games and bonuses. Some are even completely virtual, allowing you to play your favorite games from the comfort of your own home. While they may not be as exciting as the real thing, these websites can still provide a great gambling experience.</p>
<p>If you want to try your hand at a new casino game, it is recommended that you start off small and gradually increase your stakes as your confidence grows. This will help you avoid over-betting and losing too much money. Another tip is to stick with games that you enjoy. For example, if you enjoy spinning reels, try playing slot games. If you prefer betting on numbers, try out a game of roulette. And if you love playing cards, then try out an online baccarat game.</p>
<p>In Michigan, there are a number of reputable online casinos and sportsbooks available to residents. The largest Michigan casino operator, Rivers Casino, runs a sportsbook and an online casino under the BetRivers brand. This company is a subsidiary of Chicago-based Rush Street Interactive, which also operates the PlaySugarHouse online casino in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a landscape dominated by US SEC rejections and delays for <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-would-be-extremely-lucrative-according-to-bloomberg-expert/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> applications, a breakthrough has emerged on the European front. The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF, a pioneering product compliant with SFDR Article 8 via its innovative decarbonization strategy, has made its debut.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815404630/en/Jacobi-Asset-Management-lists-Europe">announcement</a>, dated August 15, reveals that Jacobi Asset Management and Wilshire Indexes have joined forces to create this groundbreaking spot Bitcoin ETF. Trading under the ticker BCOIN, the ETF has already secured a listing on Euronext Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Notably, Jacobi has introduced a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution, a strategic move that enables institutional investors to access Bitcoin&#8217;s benefits while aligning with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives.</p>
<p>Regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC), the ETF boasts a robust ecosystem of key players. Fidelity Digital Assets is the custodian, Flow Traders undertakes the role of market maker, and Authorized Participants include Jane Street and DRW.</p>
<p>Mark Makepeace, CEO of Wilshire Indexes, expressed the significance of the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF&#8217;s launch, characterizing it as a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry and a transformative step for the global financial sector. Wilshire Indexes, renowned for developing institutional-grade digital asset benchmarks, looks forward to driving the progress of the broader digital asset ecosystem through this partnership.</p>
<p>Although spot Bitcoin ETFs have been introduced in various countries, such as Brazil and Canada, the <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/us-sec-chairman-demands-strict-regulations-for-crypto-operations-across-the-country/">US SEC</a> remains steadfast in rejecting all similar applications. However, the dynamics may shift soon, following the mid-June filing by BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>In a realm where regulatory dynamics are both fluid and pivotal, the emergence of the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF underscores the growing global interest in facilitating cryptocurrency access through regulated and environmentally conscious financial products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Promising news emerges for traders invested in <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/xrp-price-analysis-xrp-outperforms-top-ten-in-gains-xrp-investment-products-see-inflows-amid-positive-lawsuit-clarity/">XRP</a> as cryptocurrency market data provider <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1691442869586829312">Kaiko</a> reveals positive developments regarding the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market dynamics on the <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/gemini-launches-global-platform-amidst-us-regulatory-challenges/">Gemini exchange</a>. The crucial aspect of market depth, defined as a market&#8217;s ability to absorb substantial orders without significantly impacting the asset&#8217;s price, has been restored for XRP on the Gemini platform.<br /><br />The recent announcement by Gemini of its XRP listing has added to the growing list of exchanges that have reintroduced XRP to their trading offerings. This development was followed by a notable surge in XRP&#8217;s valuation on the Gemini exchange, briefly propelling the token&#8217;s price to an impressive $50. However, this surge was short-lived, as prices swiftly normalized, aligning with spot market prices across other exchanges.<br /><br />The initial spike in XRP&#8217;s value on Gemini was potentially attributed to low liquidity during the hours following the token&#8217;s relisting. The sudden price increase could have been triggered by a sizeable market order, which found limited available offers at that time, causing the order to be executed at an unusually high price point.<br /><br />Crypto analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1689929018143903744">Ali</a> suggests that the market depth drop could have played a role in this scenario. Notably, the market depth for XRP on Gemini was observed to be so shallow that a relatively small order of $37,000 could prompt a 2% price movement.<br /><br />Kaiko, shedding further light on the situation, tweeted that XRP&#8217;s 1% market depth experienced a temporary decline on Gemini due to market makers pulling back in response to the rapid price spike to $50. However, this setback has since been rectified, bringing reassurance to traders. The cryptocurrency data provider&#8217;s update assures traders that XRP&#8217;s market depth has rebounded and achieved a more stable state.<br /><br />In a parallel positive development, Gemini has introduced the &#8220;XRP faucet,&#8221; an initiative involving the daily distribution of 4,000 XRP starting at 3 p.m. EST and continuing until August 18, 11:59 p.m. ET. This endeavor is expected to further engage the XRP community and expand its participation on the Gemini platform.</p>

<p>Donald Trump&#8217;s most recent public <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23876912-donald-trump-oge-public-financial-disclosure-report-2023-part-1">financial disclosure</a> has revealed his ownership of Ethereum (ETH), valued between $250,000 and $500,000.<br /><br />The 2023 Office of Government Ethics (OGE) financial disclosure documents, recently made public, contain an entry labeled &#8220;Cryptocurrency Wallet (Ethereum),&#8221; with the former President estimating its value to be within the $250,000 to $500,000 range.<br /><br />This cryptocurrency wallet likely corresponds to the <a href="https://twitter.com/BotRalgo/status/1690350249100070914?s=20">proceeds</a> from the sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that Trump launched in December 2022 after leaving the White House. The NFT collection, consisting of 44,000 limited edition digital trading cards depicting the former President in various costumes and poses, was sold out within a day.<br /><br />Reports suggest that Trump&#8217;s venture into <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/nfts-diminish-as-sales-decline-to-lowest-levels-in-a-year/">NFTs</a> generated over $8.9 million in sales, with approximately $298,000 earned in licensing fees. These earnings were collected through the same crypto wallet under the Trump entity, CIC Digital, which also received the licensing fees.<br /><br />Former first lady Melania Trump also briefly engaged with NFTs, converting several iconic images from NASA&#8217;s Apollo moon landings into digital artworks that sold for $75 each. However, the endeavor faced criticism from NASA, which contended that the project violated the space agency&#8217;s merchandise regulations.<br /><br />Interestingly, Trump&#8217;s ownership of cryptocurrency marks a shift from his prior skepticism. In 2019, he expressed his disapproval of <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-btc-sets-new-record-highs-of-35868-fundamental-indicators-reveal-something-quite-significant/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, stating that he was &#8220;not a fan&#8221; of it, deeming it &#8220;not money&#8221; and asserting that its value was based on &#8220;thin air.&#8221; During his re-election campaign in 2021, Trump reiterated his stance, referring to cryptocurrencies as &#8220;fake.&#8221;<br /><br />This new disclosure of Ethereum ownership suggests a more nuanced relationship with the crypto space for the former President.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Singapore Red Cross, a charitable organization dedicated to humanitarian aid and community services, has opened up the option for people to donate using digital currencies, forging a partnership with the crypto payment gateway Triple-A.<br /><br />Through this collaboration, individuals can now contribute to the<a href="https://redcross.sg/news-stories/stories/1292-coin-a-new-way-to-give.html"> charity</a>&#8216;s cause through donations in digital currencies. Donors can specify an amount in fiat currency, which will then be automatically converted into the chosen cryptocurrency. The organization has enabled the acceptance of major digital assets by market capitalization, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDT and USDC.<br /><br />Singapore Red Cross clarified that it does not favor any specific cryptocurrency and is open to receiving any of the aforementioned digital currencies.<br /><br />However, it&#8217;s important to note that contributions made in this manner are not currently eligible for tax deductions. Those seeking tax benefits should consider making their donations through credit card payments.<br /><br />The organization emphasized that each cryptocurrency donation will be directed towards its humanitarian efforts, focusing on enhancing the well-being of various marginalized groups, including children, isolated seniors, individuals with disabilities, and disadvantaged families.<br /><br />The initiative was summed up with the phrase, &#8220;Coin a new way to give today, your support will go a long way.&#8221;<br /><br />This move by Singapore Red Cross follows in the footsteps of other charitable organizations that have embraced cryptocurrency donations. <br /><br />For instance, in October 2021, the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital Foundation, a non-profit based in Florida, began accepting donations in various cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, and DOGE.<br /><br />Similarly, renowned organizations like Susan G. Komen and the National Children’s Advocacy Center have also ventured into accepting cryptocurrency donations. The <a href="https://www.nationalcac.org/crypto-give/">former partnered</a> with The Giving Rock to facilitate contributions in over 50 cryptocurrencies, while the latter, located in Huntsville, Alabama, became the first non-profit in the area to embrace such donations in November 2022. Donors to these organizations who opt for cryptocurrency donations can also avail of tax benefits.<br /><br />Hannah Alderson, the Crypto-project Coordinator, highlighted the positive impact of these contributions, explaining that they translate into tangible benefits such as therapy hours for children, parenting classes, medical examinations, hope, healing, and justice for children who have suffered from neglect or abuse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to insights from Bank of America Corp, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-11/paypal-s-pypl-stablecoin-entree-faces-headwinds-bank-of-america-says?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic">PayPal</a> Holdings Inc.&#8217;s introduction of a stablecoin is expected to enhance payment efficiencies and the customer experience, even though initial adoption may not be substantial. The bank points to factors such as the absence of compatibility with crypto wallets, trading pairs on exchanges, and new features as hindrances to quick adoption.<br /><br />Bank of America&#8217;s strategists Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss mentioned in a recent note that in the longer term, PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD stablecoin might face challenges in gaining traction due to increasing competition from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and yield-bearing stablecoins.<br /><br />The strategists observed that while investors may have been content with non-yield-bearing stablecoins when interest rates were low, the attractiveness of yield-bearing stablecoins is likely to grow with short-term rates above 5%. They referred to stablecoins like USDT and USDC issued by Tether and Circle Internet Financial.<br /><br />PayPal <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/paypal-sees-record-high-crypto-deposits-reaching-943m/">recently</a> made headlines by announcing the launch of its stablecoin, PayPal USD, which is backed by Paxos Trust Co. and is fully collateralized by dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries, and similar assets. The token is pegged to the US dollar and will be gradually rolled out to PayPal customers in the US.<br /><br />Bank of America acknowledged that the payments giant&#8217;s entry into the stablecoin arena could potentially boost the adoption of digital tokens for payments, especially after the setbacks faced by the crypto industry in 2022. The bank emphasized that investors are generally concerned with the safety and accessibility of stablecoins on major trading platforms.<br /><br />The strategists, however, expressed that they do not anticipate the launch of PYUSD to lead to swift regulatory clarity, as the issuance of this stablecoin doesn&#8217;t significantly impact systemic risk in traditional markets. They noted that while the launch may not alter systemic risk, it might encounter regulatory challenges if non-banks are prohibited from issuing stablecoins.<br /><br />Despite <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/stablecoin-face-supply-crunch-amid-rising-adoption/">stablecoins</a> having existed for nearly a decade, their use has largely been confined to traders moving digital assets between exchanges. The total value of stablecoins in circulation is estimated at around $126 billion, with Tether&#8217;s USDT being the largest by far.<br /><br />While PayPal is not the first company to venture into stablecoin creation, its launch comes after a high-profile attempt by Meta Platforms Inc., which faced regulatory hurdles and eventually faltered. Even PayPal temporarily halted its PYUSD project in response to heightened regulatory scrutiny.<br />Maxine Waters, a prominent Democrat and vocal critic of Meta&#8217;s project criticized PayPal&#8217;s launch for not having sufficient regulatory oversight.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Virtual Asset Exchange (<a href="https://www.hkvax.com/news/detail?diffId=1673250247927656448">HKVAX</a>), a platform with a focus on providing services like securities token offerings and various cryptocurrency-related solutions, has attained preliminary approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to operate under the country&#8217;s securities regulations.<br /><br />The SFC has granted HKVAX preliminary approval for conducting Type 1 and Type 7 regulated activities. These designations enable the platform to engage in activities related to securities trading and the provision of automated trading services, catering to both retail and institutional investors.<br /><br />In a recent announcement, HKVAX highlighted the significance of this accomplishment. The platform expressed its intent to offer a diverse range of products, encompassing services such as over-the-counter (OTC) brokerage, a high-caliber exchange platform, and a <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/hong-kong-updates-new-guidelines-for-crypto-exchange-platforms/">custody</a> solution backed by insurance coverage.<br /><br />Anthony Ng, the CEO and co-founder of HKVAX, underlined the importance of this regulatory approval as a crucial step for the platform. Ng articulated the platform&#8217;s strategy to not only expand its product offerings within the Hong Kong market but also collaborate with strategic investors for upcoming funding rounds.<br /><br />It is worth noting that HKVAX is not alone in receiving approval from the SFC. On August 3rd, HashKey and OSL achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first exchanges in Hong Kong to secure the necessary licenses for providing cryptocurrency trading services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/kraken-pushes-back-on-irs-treasure-hunt-for-crypto-user-information/">Kraken</a>, a cryptocurrency trading platform, has overtaken its competitor Coinbase to claim the<a href="https://twitter.com/DessislavaIane2/status/1689301335760363521?s=20"> top spot</a> as the most liquid exchange for altcoins in the United States for July.<br /><br />Dessislava Laneva, a research analyst at crypto data platform Kaiko, shared in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DessislavaIane2/status/1689301335760363521?s=20">tweet</a> that Kraken had secured a substantial 47% market depth for the top 10 altcoins by the close of July. This is a significant shift from January 2023, when Kraken held just 39% of the market depth for altcoins, and Coinbase led with 45%. Meanwhile, Binance.US, the U.S. branch of the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange Binance, held a 7% market share, with a combined 9% among six other platforms.<br /><br />However, a comprehensive analysis conducted by researchers at Kaiko unveiled that Kraken&#8217;s market share has surged to 47%, positioning <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/coinbase-posts-impressive-22-revenue-jump-in-q1-but-reports-79m-loss/">Coinbase</a> at 41%, Binance.US at 1%, and the remaining exchanges at 10%. This transition signifies that Kraken now possesses a greater capacity to absorb substantial market orders without causing significant fluctuations in the altcoin&#8217;s price.<br /><br />In addition to its expanding market depth, Kraken&#8217;s prominence among platforms facilitating USD deposits has also observed notable growth. The exchange&#8217;s share in the EUR spot market has risen from 35% to an impressive 53%. Furthermore, Kraken&#8217;s AUD spot market has witnessed an astounding sixfold increase over the past months.<br /><br />While Kraken enjoys considerable advancement in its digital asset market share, Coinbase has grappled with regulatory obstacles in recent times, potentially leading to a decrease in its trading volumes. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took legal action against Coinbase in early June, levying multiple allegations, including unregistered broker operations, securities exchange activities, and clearing agency functions.<br /><br />Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, recently disclosed that the Commission had mandated the suspension of trading in all altcoins due to their classification as securities, thus violating federal regulations.</p>

<h2 class="western">Arbitrum’s Evolution Continues: Spotlight on ARB’s the Cutting-Edge Improvements</h2>
<p align="left">Arbitrum Foundation has introduced its long-awaited inaugural grant initiative. Dubbed “Foundation Grants,” this program is dedicated to fostering the expansion of the Arbitrum (ARB) ecosystem by bestowing grants upon partner projects and extending support for educational initiatives.</p>
<p align="left">Each grant furnished via this initiative will follow a structure anchored in milestones and key performance indicators (KPIs), ensuring productive collaboration with chosen recipients to meet predefined objectives. The implementation of the Foundation Grant Program will occur in a series of distinct phases, each catering to applications from specific segments within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Moreover, the inaugural phase will prioritize the development of decentralized applications and infrastructure for both Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One.</p>
<p align="left">So, it’s no surprise Arbitrum (ARB) spiked by 4.4% over the past week, from $1.13 to $1.18. Driven by its focus on efficiency and sustainability, Arbitrum’s (ARB) price is expected to increase by 13.6%, from $1.18 to $1.34 in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 class="western">Momentum Shift: Monero (XMR) Exhibits Promising Bullish Trend</h2>
<p align="left">Monero’s (XMR) price jumped by 2.03% over the past week, from $158.14 to $161.36. Experts point out that the rising demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs positively influenced Monero’s (XMR) price dynamics.</p>
<p align="left">Additionally, Monero&#8217;s (XMR) dynamic fee structure prevents fees from becoming excessively high, regardless of increasing usage. The blockchain operates without any set limits, ensuring flexibility and affordability.</p>
<p align="left">Furthermore, the global competition surrounding the development of CBDCs has further contributed to Monero’s (XMR) growing popularity. Monero’s (XMR) enhanced ring signatures also enable quick and secure validation of private transactions.</p>
<p align="left">As Monero (XMR) bolsters its network capabilities, experts say Monero’s (XMR) price can spike by 5.52%, from $161.36 to $170.27.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/bittrex-announces-partnership-to-launch-new-crypto-platform-for-middle-east-and-north-africa/">Bittrex</a> and its CEO have reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a sum of $24 million. This agreement comes after the SEC filed charges against the exchange in April for functioning as an unregistered trading platform.</p>
<p>In the court filing submitted on Thursday, neither the exchange nor its foreign affiliate, along with former CEO William Shihara, admitted or denied the allegations. Bittrex Global GmbH, the foreign affiliate, has also agreed to resolve the accusations, about its failure to register as a national securities exchange, according to an<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-150"> official statement by the SEC</a>.</p>
<p>Gurbir S. Grewal, who heads the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division, emphasized that Bittrex had attempted to eliminate any indications that the token issuers&#8217; online statements were linked to investment contracts, to evade federal securities regulations. This attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the charges. Grewal noted that the settlement highlights the significance of the economic realities behind such offerings, rather than merely altering labels or descriptions.</p>
<p>William Shihara expressed contentment with the settlement outcome in an emailed statement, regarding it as a positive resolution. He stressed the importance of achieving a balance between fostering innovation, supporting entrepreneurs, and safeguarding consumers. Shihara hoped that this settlement could contribute to advancing these goals.</p>
<p>Bittrex had applied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May, disclosing estimated assets and liabilities ranging between $500 million and $1 billion. The company had already revealed plans to withdraw from the U.S. market in March. At its peak, Bittrex accounted for nearly 23% of USD support in the cryptocurrency exchange market during the initial months of 2018.</p>
<p>The SEC has taken a strong stance against unregistered crypto exchanges, as demonstrated by their legal actions against Bittrex and, more recently, Coinbase in June. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has consistently underscored the necessity for compliance within the cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<p>He has highlighted that while trading platforms deal with various crypto tokens, they often lack the established safeguards against fraud and manipulation that are present in traditional financial markets. Gensler reiterated this concern during an interview with Bloomberg last month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The digital asset platform<a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/bakkt-to-buy-apex-crypto-for-200-million/"> Bakkt</a> has revealed a remarkable surge in its total revenue for the second quarter of this year, reaching $348 million. This represents a significant leap from the $14 million recorded in the same quarter of the previous year, 2022.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company clarified that the current quarter&#8217;s revenue of $348 million is inclusive of gross revenue, adhering to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), while the $14 million reported last year was based on total revenue on a net basis.</p>
<p>Based in New York City, Bakkt attributed its impressive earnings to the acquisition of Apex Crypto in April. The substantial increase in gross crypto services revenue was primarily fueled by the trading activities of Apex Crypto. The company communicated this in an <a href="https://investors.bakkt.com/news/news-details/2023/Bakkt-Reports-Second-Quarter-2023-Results/default.aspx">official earnings statement</a>.</p>
<p>Gavin Michael, the CEO of Bakkt, underlined the significance of acquiring Apex Crypto at the start of the quarter. He stated, &#8220;The completion of our acquisition of Apex Crypto marked a pivotal moment for our company. We&#8217;ve been able to significantly expand our presence within the crypto ecosystem, achieving strong traction by engaging new clients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apex Crypto has since been rebranded as Bakkt Crypto Solutions. Bakkt further<a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/bakkt-set-to-launch-crypto-transaction-app-by-2020/"> bolstered</a> its client portfolio by bringing invstr, Swan Bitcoin, and Blockchain.com into the fold.</p>
<p>While Bakkt&#8217;s traded volume experienced a decline of 51%, amounting to $531 million, the number of transacting accounts also witnessed a 20% drop compared to the previous year. The company attributed these declines in trading to the prevailing &#8220;slowdown&#8221; within the crypto market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bakkt noted a 3% increase in its assets under custody, which reached $660 million. This growth can be attributed to the elevated values of certain cryptocurrencies, as stated by Bakkt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the widely applauded launch of a stablecoin by <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/paypal-sees-record-high-crypto-deposits-reaching-943m/">PayPal</a> this week, signaling the entrance of a prominent American payment giant into the blockchain arena, the overall supply of this asset category has experienced a prolonged decline spanning more than a year.</p>
<p>Recent <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2308.htm#:~:text=To%20obtain%20a%20written%20notification,of%20its%20activities%2C%20and%20the">data</a> underscores a steady reduction in the aggregate supply of stablecoins since the midpoint of 2022. The trajectory continued into 2023, witnessing a decline of approximately 12%. The total supply dwindled from $139 billion at the outset of the year to $122 billion by August.</p>
<p>Market analysts are now anticipating a potential reversal of this downturn, particularly given PayPal&#8217;s newfound involvement in the sector. The belief is that PayPal&#8217;s active engagement could validate the utility of stablecoins, not only elucidating their functional value but also compelling traditional financial institutions to embrace these digital assets due to competitive pressures. Mark Lurie, CEO of Shipyard Software, expressed this sentiment, emphasizing that if PayPal effectively demonstrates the practical application of stablecoins, it could trigger a significant wave of adoption.</p>
<p>Concurrently, regulatory frameworks seem to be positioning themselves to accommodate an expansion in<a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/stablecoin-issuer-tethers-q1-profits-surge-to-1-5-billion/"> stablecoin</a> utilization. In a communiqué directed at state member banks with interest in &#8220;issuing, holding, or transacting in dollar tokens to facilitate payments,&#8221; the U.S. Federal Reserve stipulated the necessity for banks to establish robust protocols to manage liquidity and mitigate the risks of illicit financial activities.</p>
<p>The central bank has taken a proactive stance, unveiling the &#8220;Novel Activities Supervision Program&#8221; to bolster oversight over banks engaged in stablecoin activities. This program encompasses a comprehensive supervision enhancement across all financial institutions under its purview. The focus is extended to include cryptocurrency, distributed ledger technology, and novel partnerships between nonbank entities and financial service providers, aimed at delivering technologically-driven financial solutions to consumers.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the UK Treasury has joined this regulatory trend. They have <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1176540/Payments_Regulation_and_the_Systemic_Perimeter_-_Consultation_Response.pdf">released</a> a consultation response detailing updated propositions for a regulatory framework overseeing systemic stablecoins. The framework delineates the collaborative supervisory approach between the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, orchestrating stablecoin issuance and usage oversight in tandem.</p>

With Microsoft&#8217;s involvement, Aptos is set to solidify its status as a Layer 1 blockchain, extending its influence beyond the boundaries of the Web 3.0 ecosystem into the expansive realm of technology at large.<br /><br />By the terms of the Aptos-Microsoft collaboration, Aptos will leverage the capabilities of Microsoft Azure OpenAI services to enhance its offerings comprehensively. In a joint statement issued by both entities, it was emphasized that the diverse array of services from both organizations will be advantageous for Aptos&#8217; &#8220;developers in their endeavors to construct intelligent contracts and decentralized applications.&#8221;<br /><br />This announcement catalyzed a 10% increase in the<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/"> price of Aptos (APT)</a>, reaching $7.52 per coin. Despite the prevailing volatility within the cryptocurrency sphere, the recent surge has repositioned APT as a standout contender among high-potential tokens.<br /><br />The strategic agreement between <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/aptos-apt-400-gains-in-january-traced-to-crazy-buying-in-korean-communities-aave-v3-deploys-on-ethereum/">Aptos</a> and Microsoft has been met with applause from stakeholders within the digital currency ecosystem. However, it also underscores a broader trend evident among emerging Web 3.0 protocols. Much like Aptos, Ankr Protocol has solidified a parallel partnership with Microsoft over the past year.<br /><br />Notably, other prominent tech giants, such as Google and Amazon, are similarly intensifying their engagement with the blockchain domain through collaborations with burgeoning Web 3.0 protocols. These partnerships collectively reinforce the notion that blockchain and traditional technology frameworks can harmoniously coexist.</p>

<h2 align="left">Ethereum&#8217;s (ETH) Current Decline Could Be a Perfect Buying Period</h2>

The value of <a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-braces-for-new-wave-of-volatility-data-shows/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) has dropped by 1.89% in the last seven days, falling from $1,870.21 on July 31, 2023, to $1,834.81 at the time of writing. Experts suggest this is a perfect buying period, as Ethereum (ETH) will experience a significant price rally in the coming months.</p>

<p align="left">The price of Optimism (OP) has increased by over 20% in recent weeks due to a combination of underlying solid reasons. One of these factors is Zora, a popular Web3 NFT minting platform, which is now connected to the Optimism (OP) network. Optimism&#8217;s (OP) affiliation with Zora has helped its stand out among layer-2 competitors, experiencing a <b>47% increase in daily transactions</b> since July 20, 2023.</p>

This has further expanded Optimism&#8217;s (OP) reach, enabling more activities in its ecosystem. These events have helped Optimism (OP) build and maintain a bullish momentum over the past weeks.</p>
<p align="left">Optimism (OP) has seen a <b>7% </b>increase since the month began, rising from $1.58 on August 1, 2023, to $1.70 at the time of writing. Based on Optimism&#8217;s (OP) previous price movements and Bitcoin&#8217;s halving cycles, market analysts predict that Optimism (OP) will continue on its uptrend, reaching the $2 price level by September 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/ripple-ceo-states-the-company-is-mostly-recruiting-abroad/">Ripple</a>, a pioneer in blockchain technology, has<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230807853646/en/Centigrade-Announces-New-Open-Data-Platform-to-Restore-Trust-in-Carbon-Markets"> initiated</a> a far-reaching endeavor to infuse carbon markets with transparency, trustworthiness, and ethical standards.</p>
<p>Historically, carbon markets, which facilitate the trading of carbon credits to counterbalance CO2 emissions, have grappled with issues of opacity and doubt. Demonstrating its unwavering commitment to addressing climate change, Ripple committed a substantial $100 million investment towards this cause last year.</p>
<p>In a strategic collaboration with Centigrade, a technology provider focused on climate solutions, Ripple now seeks to elevate its efforts even further. Centigrade has launched an open data platform designed to cultivate faith in the global voluntary<a href="https://www.kryptomoney.com/eco-friendly-bitcoin-mining/"> carbon markets</a>.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s primary objective is to offer top-notch data, streamlined accessibility, and heightened transparency, all working together to nurture an equitable, dynamic, and efficient carbon market. However, it&#8217;s important to note that this platform doesn&#8217;t serve as a trading or rating system; rather, its purpose lies in providing indispensable data to all stakeholders within the carbon credit ecosystem, encompassing sellers, buyers, and service providers.</p>
<p>This bold initiative by Ripple and Centigrade positions them as pivotal players in delivering a vital service to the carbon market. By making informed decisions possible for investors, the open data platform could potentially stimulate the availability of high-quality credits, thus ensuring the smooth operation of both carbon and nature markets.</p>
<p>This undertaking stands as a core component of Ripple&#8217;s comprehensive strategy to combat climate change. Having previously invested in the tokenization of carbon credits, Ripple persists in advocating for environmentally conscious practices within the realm of cryptocurrency.</p>
