										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Real-world economic performance undeniably impacts global cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin (BTC), the biggest crypto asset by market capitalization, proving an excellent guide to the health of the crypto industry. Recent increases in inflation worldwide, but particularly in the US, have seen the value of Bitcoin slide during the second half of 2022 as the global economic crisis takes hold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While this isn&rsquo;t great news for existing investors in the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, excellent investment opportunities in exciting new crypto projects remain. One of the most enticing new crypto projects is <a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a>, which saw an enthusiastic uptake during its beta presale stage, raising almost $1 million in just three weeks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is the world&rsquo;s first virtual gaming arcade that uses Web3 and blockchain technology to revolutionize the GameFi metaverse industry. The platform will host the broadest range of play-to-earn (P2E) games in the metaverse and offer gamers the same level of fun and social interaction they&rsquo;d get visiting a real-life video arcade from the comfort of their gaming chair or sofa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The P2E element of the community is one of several ways community users benefit from the platform. The other revenue stream initiatives are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Compete2Earn &ndash; earning by staking tokens and gaining tournament rewards</li>
<li dir="ltr">Create2Earn &ndash; earning by interacting with the community and its members</li>
<li dir="ltr">Work2Earn &ndash; earning through finding new Web3 role on the jobs board, which launches in Q1 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to the opportunities to earn, Metacade is a platform that allows budding developers to earn their stripes by supporting them to learn game development and has plans to become a self-sufficient and fully-fledged DAO by Q4 2024.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How Metacade works</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike many GameFi platforms,&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> has a diverse offering that stretches beyond the P2E element. The native token for the platform is the MCADE coin, and there are several ways Metacade generates revenue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade&rsquo;s revenue-generating features include a range of pay-to-play arcade games, just like gamers would expect to find in a real-world video arcade. There&rsquo;s also advertising on the platform, entry fees for prize draws and to compete in tournaments, and the launchpad initiative, which allows external companies to release games in Metacade for a price. These revenue streams provide the funds that flow into gamers&rsquo; wallets as they earn rewards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of titles available on Metacade will continue to grow. This growth will be aided from Q3 2023 by the introduction of the Metagrants initiative. Metagrants are a source of funding for developers to build games on the platform. Developers submit gaming proposals to be voted on by MCADE token holders, who determine the community&rsquo;s favorite ideas. The winning developers will receive funding to help turn their proposals into reality. The first Metagrant-backed games hit the Metacade library in Q1 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other features in the pipeline include introducing a jobs board in Q1 2024 to boost the Work2Earn initiative. The board will feature a range of opportunities from internships, short-term gig work, and full-time roles within the GameFi industry with Metacade-approved partners, giving anyone with a genuine interest in working in Web3 development a helping hand to get started in the industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Metacade&rsquo;s transition into becoming a DAO begins in Q2 2023, with the process estimated to take 18 months before community members assume all of the critical roles. This autonomy is one of Metacade&rsquo;s leading lights; it hands control of the platform&rsquo;s future direction to the most important community members.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why could MCADE surge?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The breadth of Metacade&rsquo;s plans, found in more detail in their <a href="https://metacade.co/whitepaper.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>white paper</u></a>, makes it an exciting prospect for investors hunting for new crypto projects. With many other GameFi developments focusing on a minimal range of options, it&rsquo;s easy for them to become little more than a fad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade&rsquo;s offering will not fall into that trap. The range of games on offer will continue to increase, providing additional opportunities to earn, whether through competitions, playing, or creating social content to engage with the community. Furthermore, the continual addition of new games means there&rsquo;s no risk of the platform becoming boring or stale since it will continually reinvent itself with the regular release of new and exciting titles. As a result, Metacade has solid project longevity.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the community will ultimately have complete autonomy over how Metacade develops. Gamers&rsquo; interests will forever be at the heart of the platform&rsquo;s development, unlike in more traditional gaming, where developers have to balance that with providing a return to shareholders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These plans place Metacade at the forefront of the blockchain gaming revolution.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How to purchase MCADE tokens</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Metacade beta sale sold out in less than four weeks, making it one of the most attractive new crypto projects currently in its presale stage. The price will increase by more than double as &nbsp;the ninth and final presale round concludes, raising a total market cap of $28 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Getting on board with Metacade couldn&rsquo;t be simpler. Tokens can be purchased on Metacade&rsquo;s website by anyone with a Wallet Connect-supported crypto wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can purchase MCADE with ETH (Ethereum) or USDT (Tether). First, connect your wallet to Metacade&rsquo;s website to access the DEX, and then accept the option to purchase MCADE with ETH or USDT.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You can buy BTC at eToro&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://coinjournal.net/visit/etoro-crypto?guid=OTg5NzA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can participate in the Metacade pre-sale&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Binance ranked lower for its &lsquo;incomplete&rsquo; PoR among other metrics.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>Nic Carter says the PoR momentum is good for crypto and a &ldquo;silver lining&rdquo; out of the FTX chaos.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/wallets/bitmex/">BitMEX</a> and Kraken score highly in an assessment of proof-of-reserves attestations by major crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s according Nic Carter, one of the most popular Bitcoin advocates out there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a Medium article highlighting the score list and rankings of some of the leading crypto trading platforms, Carter points out the latest PoR results and offers insight into why some of the exchanges just getting to publish their cryptographic proof of reserves may still have a lot of work to offer the assurances the market seeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Kraken and BitMEX rank highest, the world&rsquo;s largest crypto platform <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> posts a relatively low score. But according to the crypto analyst, the move to have PoRs is undeniably one in the right direction. He sees the momentum as a good signal for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a>, terming it &ldquo;<em>a genuine silver lining from the FTX debacle</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We may well yet emerge from this crisis with a major step forward in exchange credibility</em>,&rdquo; he <a href="https://medium.com/@nic__carter/the-status-of-proof-of-reserve-as-of-year-end-2022-48120159377c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in his &lsquo;The Status of Proof of Reserve as of Year End 2022&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BitMEX, Kraken rank higher on various metrics</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at crypto exchange reserves attestations via metrics such as assets for which the platform provided the attestation, estimates of deposits covered and disclosure of liabilities, BitMEX scored the highest with 5 out of 6.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto platform Kraken was second, while Deribit, KuCoin and OKX ranked third to fifth in that order.</p>

Source: Nic Carter on Medium</span></span></span>While some platforms scored highly Binance&rsquo;s proof of reserves was mostly &lsquo;incomplete&rsquo; and thus the exchange scored poorly. &nbsp;In a comment on this, Carter wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Binance&rsquo;s first PoR doesn&rsquo;t grant strong assurances. It only covers Bitcoin, which only represents 16.5% of their client assets. It does allow individual users to verify their inclusion in the liability set but does not contain the entire liability list, making it hard for a third party to verify the procedure</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Polkadot price plunged hard in 2022.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The decline was caused by both internal and external factors.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It will only recover if the Fed shifts its tone and its ecosystem rebounds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Polkadot price plunged by more than 84% in 2022m capping its worst year on record. DOT slipped to a low of $4.2, which was lower than its record high of $55. This performance was due to the overall weakness of cryptocurrencies, high-interest rates, and the collapse of key players in the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Polkadot parachain challenges</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/polkadot/"><u>Polkadot</u></a> price had its worst year on record due to multiple factors. First, it suffered from the biggest&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/"><u>crypto news</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>during the year following the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research. This collapse led to major challenges in the industry as exchanges like Binance and Coinbase recorded remarkable outflows.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Polkadot also plunged following the collapse of Terra and its ecosystem, which led to over $40 billion in total losses. The collapse pushed more people to lose faith in crypto tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, an extremely hawkish Federal Reserve had an impact on Polkadot and other cryptocurrencies. The Fed hiked rates by 450 basis points and pointed towards more in 2023. This happened as inflation jumped to a 40-year high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Internally. Polkadot&rsquo;s ecosystem faced issues of its own. The most significant was the de-pegging of Acala Dollar, an algorithmic stablecoin developed by Acala Network. The stablecoin is yet to regain its peg.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other Polkadot parachains also had major challenges. For example, Enjin&rsquo;s Efinity saw little traction as demand for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) collapsed. Total NFTs sold dropped by more than 90% from January.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Moonriver and Moonbeam have also struggled to gain traction in the DeFi and other industries like the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking forward, the main driver for Polkadot price in 2023 will be the actions of the Federal Reserve. A dovish shift by the Fed will lead to more growth for the stock. DOT and other coins will not recover until the Fed shifts its tone and its ecosystem rebounds.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Polkadot price outlook</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/30/1672393229912-cf184665-6545-4071-813d-15575fdd32c5.png" style="width: 631px;height: 313.397px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="631" height="313.397"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Turning to the daily chart, we see that the DOT price sell-off caught no breather in 2022. The coin continued falling as risks in the industry rose. As it crashed, it managed to move below all moving averages. It also moved to the lower side of the Bollinger Bands.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling as bears target the next key support level at $2. A rebound to about $20 will only happen if the Fed suddenly becomes dovish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/"><u>Cryptocurrency prices</u></a> drifted downwards on the final week of the year as concerns about a global recession coincided with those of high interest rates. Bitcoin darted lower and reached a low of $16,485. Other coins like XRP, ETH, and ADA dropped as well. Here is the crypto price prediction from the last week of the year.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Mirror Protocol (MIR)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Mirror Protocol, a dead cryptocurrency, was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the final week of the year. It spiked to a high of $0.24, which was about 173% above the lowest level this year. It has now pulled back to $0.14.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mirror Protocol was an important part of Terra&rsquo;s ecosystem, as I wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/terra-luna-classic-price-prediction-as-lunc-goes-vertical/"><u>here</u></a>. It used its technology to make it possible for people to buy and sell financial assets in a tokenized manner. For example, it was possible for people to buy Apple shares in a token form. The benefit of this was that users could trade these tokens on a 24-hour basis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mirror went obsolete following the collapse of Terra Protocol and the Terra USD stablecoin. Now, the price has moved above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved to the neutral point at 50. Therefore, I suspect that MIR price will remain under pressure as sellers target the key support at $0.1225.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">How to buy Mirror Protocol</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
                </p><p>As MIR is such a new asset, it's yet to be listed on major exchanges. You can still purchase MIR using a DEX (decentralised exchange) though, which just means there are a few extra steps. To buy MIR right now, follow these steps:</p>

                                    <h3>1. Buy ETH on a regulated exchange or broker, like <a href="/visit/etoro-crypto?guid=OTg5NjQ&amp;component=news-table-1inch" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored">eToro &rsaquo;</a></h3>
                    <p>We suggest <a href="/visit/etoro-crypto?guid=OTg5NjQ&amp;component=news-table-1inch" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored">eToro</a> because it's one of the world's leading multi-asset trading platforms, an exchange and wallet all-in-one with some of the lowest fees in the industry. It's also beginner-friendly, and has more payment methods available to users than any other available service.</p>
                                    <h3>2. Send your ETH to a compatible wallet like Trust Wallet or MetaMask</h3>
                    <p>You'll need to create your wallet, grab your address, and send your coins there.</p>
                                    <h3>3. Connect your wallet to the 1Inch DEX</h3>
                    <p>Head to 1Inch, and 'connect' your wallet to it.</p>
                                    <h3>4. You can now swap your ETH for MIR</h3>
                    <p>Now that you're connected, you'll be able to swap for 100s of coins including MIR.</p>
                
<h2 dir="ltr">Serum (SRM)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/serum/"><u>Serum</u></a> is another dead cryptocurrency. It was a leading player in Solana&rsquo;s ecosystem, where it had a total value locked (TVL) of more than $1.5 billion. Serum&rsquo;s problem was that its personal key was held by FTX, which led to a loss of confidence in the ecosystem. Today, Serum&rsquo;s total value locked has slumped to less than $395k.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SRM dropped to a low of $0.115 this week and then zoomed higher to $0.15. It has managed to move above the moving averages but it has also gotten overbought. Therefore, I believe that the bearish momentum will resume during the weekend. If this happens, it will likely retest the important support point at $0.12.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Solana had one of the hardest downfalls in 2022. It plunged from an all-time high of $260 to $10. The most recent sell-off was due to its close affiliation to FTX and Alameda, which were its key funders. Therefore, the collapse of FTX led to a major liquidation, which pushed the price significantly lower.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the daily chart, Solana remains below all moving averages and the psychological level of $10. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved below the oversold level. Therefore, Solana will likely continue falling as sellers target the next key support point at $5.</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>The United Kingdom&rsquo;s NFT industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 34.5% over the next 5-6 years.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>NFT spend in the UK will increase from $1,725.2 million in 2022 to $9,257.0 million by 2028.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>Increased adoption, government support and venture funding are key factors to that growth.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The global non-fungible tokens (NFT) market took a hit alongside the rest of the market in 2022, with sales volumes and creator revenue seeing a significant decline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But despite the brutal crash that&rsquo;s characterised the crypto sector throughout the year, the latest trends and projections suggest the NFT industry will continue to grow over the next six years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Key segments in the next few years will be collectibles and art, real estate, sports, gaming, fashion &amp; luxury and utility.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">UK&rsquo;s NFT industry to grow at a CAGR of 34.5% up to 2028</h2>
<p dir="ltr">2021 remains a benchmark year for various sectors, yet according to a recent Research and Markets NFT industry <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-kingdom-nft-market-intelligence-report-2022-2028---nft-marketplaces-are-raising-funding-rounds-to-drive-their-growth-301710934.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, 2022-2028 would see growth at a CAGR of 34.5%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The United Kingdom will see its NFT industry grow from $1,725.2 million in 2022 to $9,257 million by 2028. The forecast put the NFT Spend Value for the UK on an upwards trajectory of an annual 48% for this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Research and Markets report highlighted on Thursday forecasts widespread adoption of digital assets across the country&rsquo;s different user groups will spark even further interest in NFTs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among factors to aid the UK NFT industry is the increased participation from innovative startups, sports clubs and even real estate giants. Just recently, Premier League giants Manchester United unveiled their NFT collection, joining an industry that&rsquo;s already boasting of major global brands.As <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tezos-strike-deal-with-manchester-united/">previously reported</a>, the soccer club partnered blockchain platform Tezos in February this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The growing recognition and support for the industry from the UK government is another factor, as is the rising number of investors backing NFT startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Crypto is famous for producing insane returns, and getting in on crypto presales is the easiest way to ensure the highest potential for gains. This high potential for earning, followed by a decrease, is caused by an economic principle called the <em>law of diminishing returns</em>, which states that an asset&rsquo;s value growth will begin to slow down over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One presale that has proven to be a significant success is Metacade (MCADE). Metacade is building a major GameFi platform to rival some of the biggest names in the space, so it&rsquo;s worth investigating before the price rises even further.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Metacade presale is a big investment opportunity</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto presales are extremely popular, especially for projects with strong fundamentals like&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a>. Case in point, the beta phase of the MCADE presale attracted over $1.3 million worth of investment in just four weeks, reflecting the project&rsquo;s long-term potential.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade launched its MCADE token at $0.008 at the beginning of its crypto presale, but now the price is rising. The price will continue growing until it reaches $0.02 at the end of the presale. For investors looking to get a good deal, the sooner you pick up tokens the better.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MCADE price prediction: 2023 and beyond</h2>
<p dir="ltr">After reaching $0.02 at the end of its presale, MCADE will be launched on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and the team will start to form partnerships to expand the reach of the token. Aside from this, the MCADE token will gain utility once it opens the comprehensive gaming experience planned for the Metacade platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The long-term potential of Metacade is very promising as a result. Experts predict explosive price action during 2023, which could see gains of up to 50x. This price explosion would give the MCADE token a value of $1 &ndash; a significant increase from its final crypto presale value of $0.02.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After 2023, analysts expect the crypto market to begin its next bull run once Bitcoin&rsquo;s halving event ends during 2024. Bull markets usually produce major gains across the board, which could push the MCADE token up in value even further. <strong>By this time, MCADE could reach over $5, a massive 250x increase between the crypto presale and 2025.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is creating the biggest arcade on the blockchain, bringing advanced gaming capabilities to the world of Web3. GameFi enthusiasts can play a wide range of arcade-style games that each offer crypto rewards and participate in paid entry tournaments to win MCADE prizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several additional features truly make Metacade stand out as a prime investment opportunity during its crypto presale. First, the project aims to serve Web3 users directly by providing a central location for gamers to get together and access valuable information about the space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over time, Metacade aims to become a decentralized autonomous organization (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-dao/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DAO</u></a>). This shift will give complete control over the platform to the Metacade community, as all MCADE token holders will be able to vote in governance proposals and help drive the project&rsquo;s future progress.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How does Metacade work?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain gamers can access endless challenges across many play-to-earn (<a href="https://www.securitytokenizer.io/what-is-gamefi"><u>P2E</u></a>) games. Whether looking to play casually or competitively, Metacade offers players the chance to enjoy various addictive arcade games while earning MCADE tokens for their efforts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the Metacade, gamers also earn crypto tokens for contributing useful information to the community. These contributions can include the latest tips and tricks and anything else to help other gamers make the most out of their blockchain gaming experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another key feature offered by Metacade is the chance to test out brand-new blockchain games before they officially launch. These beta-testing roles allow players to provide feedback to game developers, who can implement any improvements suggested by the Metacade community, including bug fixes and gameplay optimizations.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade is expanding the reach of blockchain-based gaming</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade also aims to provide a critical service that can help the wider GameFi industry to grow. Its Metagrants program will provide funding for the most in-demand blockchain games, as the Metacade community will be able to vote for the titles that they most want to play in the future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain is a technological advancement hub, and Metacade supports continuing progress in this area. Early-stage funding is critical in the process, as creating and launching new games requires a high level of support. <strong>Through connecting developers with its community of gamers, Metacade is directly helping to expand the scope and scale of innovation in blockchain.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Metacade worth buying in 2023?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Metacade presale is a significant buying opportunity for crypto investors. Luckily, $0.008 is a meagre price for a project that offers real promise for the future, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that the beta phase sold out quickly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presale will see the MCADE token rise to $0.02, so investors still have time to make some bear market gains. However, Metacade is undoubtedly a great addition to any investment portfolio, and it will be fascinating to see if it will reach the $1 mark during 2023.</p>
<p><strong>You can participate in the MCADE presale&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<li>SEC stopped ICOs, lending programs, agreements for future tokens</li>
<li>Dinner meetings between Bankman-Fried and government officials were &ldquo;bad judgment&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>John Stark, a former chief of the SEC office of internet enforcement and president of John Reed Stark Consulting, joined CNBC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Squawk Box&rsquo; to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/12/29/i-would-be-shocked-if-regulators-did-not-meet-with-ftx-says-john-stark.html">discuss</a> the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<h2>Worrying lack of due diligence</h2>
<p>The host raised the issue of due diligence, more specifically the lack thereof where investments in FTX were concerned. He asked Stark what can be done about that. John Stark responded by quoting Sam Bankman-Fried himself:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>We don&rsquo;t look at the product, service, etc&hellip;we look at whether this is an idea we can pitch to someone. If we think this is something we can sell, then we&rsquo;re all in. Due diligence is absurd. It&rsquo;s just the wrong way to invest. When you invest, you should look for value, you should look for the long-term.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>The (FTX) business model is something the public isn&rsquo;t used to&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Stark replied:</p>
<p><em>I agree the model is different, and to me it&rsquo;s absurd, but&hellip;these are investors like everyone else.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Which agency&hellip;should be ashamed that we&rsquo;re in this situation, where customers have lost their money and have no claims on anything coming out of bankruptcy?</strong></p>
<p>Stark defended the state agencies in response, pointing out they&rsquo;ve won many cases; they stopped ICOs, lending programs, agreements for future tokens, they stopped <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> from doing the lending program&hellip;They have been very aggressive and are going to be more aggressive when it comes to these crypto intermediaries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He added that he&nbsp;would be &lsquo;shocked&rsquo; if regulators did not meet with FTX, saying:</p>
<p><em>You try not to meet with con artists.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Prompted by the host to discuss the &ldquo;dinner meetings&rdquo; between <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/a-lot-of-people-are-hurt-and-thats-on-me-says-sam-bankman-fried/">Bankman-Fried</a> and government officials, he said those occurrences weren&rsquo;t impeachable offenses, only bad judgment. &nbsp;</p>

<li>Retail investors will sit out of the crypto market in 2023</li>
<li>VC funds aren&rsquo;t going to stop investing just because of FTX </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>TechCrunch senior crypto reporter Jacquelyn Melinek talked to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/12/29/melinek-theres-a-high-chance-retail-investors-will-sit-out-of-the-crypto-market-in-2023.html">CNBC Market Alert</a> about what lies ahead for the crypto market in 2023, after a painful year for digital assets, investors and other stakeholders in the sector.</p>
<p><strong>Will crypto have any kind of future in 2023?</strong></p>
<p>Jacquelyn Melinek:</p>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s a high chance retail investors will sit out of the crypto market in 2023, especially those who have been interested in the past but have seen many industry changing events like Terra&rsquo;s collapse&hellip;at the same time, the true believers are those who are building the space, so these people <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/best-altcoins-to-buy-during-the-crypto-crash-for-2023/">will continue to be here in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Who will be the main investors in crypto in 2023?</strong></p>
<p><em>VC funds aren&rsquo;t going to stop investing just because of what happened with FTX. We&rsquo;re seeing big brand businesses like Starbucks getting into the space. Beyond that, we&rsquo;re going to keep seeing banks getting into the space.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>2022 has been a rough year for anyone that needs capital. What needs to happen for the crypto ecosystem to &ldquo;get its mojo&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p><em>Trust needs to be rebuilt 100%. Regulators <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/us-banking-committee-chairman-suggests-banning-cryptocurrencies/">need to step in</a> and create a framework instead of using old-school techniques that we see with traditional markets.&nbsp;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Curious about the future of the metaverse and which projects will dominate? This article will discuss through The Sandbox, Metacade, and Decentraland price forecasts for 2025 and give you an idea of what you might expect in the long-term. </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is The Sandbox (SAND)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The Sandbox</u></a> is a decentralized 3D world that allows users to create, share, and monetize in-game experiences. The Sandbox lets players build whatever they like using voxels, the blocks that are characteristic of the game&rsquo;s design. This isn&rsquo;t just an aesthetic choice, however; they&rsquo;re designed to be easy to manipulate and allow players to create intricate and detailed objects, like cars, buildings, sculptures, and more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To build in The Sandbox, players first need to own LAND. LAND tokens are non-fungible, allowing them to be bought and sold with SAND tokens. Once they own LAND, players can choose to buy ASSETs (objects designed by other players) or build items in VoxEdit and use them in the Game Maker to create immersive games and experiences. Companies like Forbes, Gucci, and Warner Music Group have all used these tools to take their first steps in the metaverse, and many more are likely to come.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Sandbox (SAND) Price Forecast 2025</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With metaverse adoption growing, it&rsquo;s likely that The Sandbox will live up to its namesake and act as a testing ground for brands looking to join this new digital frontier. Adding more names to its already-growing list of high-profile companies using The Sandbox will likely spur a flood of investment and could push SAND much higher than its current price of $0.42. At the least, $2.50 is definitely achievable, while somewhere between $4.50 and $5 is more likely.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade (MCADE)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is a community-based platform built for metaverse and play-to-earn (P2E) gaming. It&rsquo;s a hub where gamers go to discover the latest P2E games, explore the rapidly-expanding metaverse space alongside like-minded peers, and make a direct impact on the future of&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-gamefi-and-how-does-it-work" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GameFi</u></a>. At its core, Metacade has everything you&rsquo;ll need to make the most out of metaverse and P2E gaming, like reviews, leaderboards, alpha, forums, and chat rooms, where you can make friends and earn for your contributions to the community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s right: every time you post a review, some game-winning tips, or other useful content, you&rsquo;re rewarded with MCADE tokens for your part in growing the platform. You&rsquo;ll also discover regular prize draws and tournaments where you&rsquo;ll go head-to-head against other Metacade users for a chance to win big. There are even plans for a job board in 2024, where you&rsquo;ll find gigs, part-time roles, and salaried positions working with some of the biggest names in Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By 2025, two of Metacade&rsquo;s most attractive features will be live. The first is its <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)</u></a>, where users will be able to participate in shaping the world&rsquo;s first player-owned virtual arcade. The second is the Metagrant. Metagrants are a funding tool that lets Metacade users vote on the development of P2E games. Developers present their ideas to the community, and the one that receives the most votes is awarded funding from the Metacade treasury to help bring their game to life.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade (MCADE) Price Forecast 2025</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With a host of innovative features, a focus on community ownership, and the potential to rapidly attract thousands of players, Metacade is likely to be ahead of the curve by 2025. The MCADE token is currently in presale and is expected to launch to the public at $0.02 per token.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given that metaverse and GameFi adoption is expected to accelerate by 2025, achieving $0.20 &ndash; a 10x increase &ndash; is a reasonable forecast. If things work out as planned for Metacade, reaching anywhere from $0.50 to $1 is a strong possibility. In other words, a $1,000 investment made at the end of presale could be worth as much as $25,000 to $50,000 by 2025!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Decentraland (MANA)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://decentraland.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Decentraland</u></a>, like The Sandbox, is a 3D world where players can own in-game property (also known as LAND), create experiences, and explore others&rsquo; creations. Whereas The Sandbox places a greater emphasis on games, however, Decentraland&rsquo;s purpose is more general, focusing on user-generated content and art. Decentraland also allows users to discover the world around them in VR &ndash; something The Sandbox is yet to offer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since its inception in 2017, Decentraland has grown to host art galleries, museums, casinos, nightclubs, hotels, and more. It also regularly hosts events, like concerts, conferences, and social meetups for the community to enjoy. As part of its DAO structure, Decentraland allows users to attend a virtual town hall meeting and vote to determine the future of the platform.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Decentraland (MANA) Price Forecast 2025</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While Decentraland doesn&rsquo;t have partnerships with as many brands as The Sandbox, its status as one of the oldest metaverse projects is likely to give it an edge. As more players join the metaverse revolution, MANA could see a new wave of investment and pick-up traction, sending it much higher than today&rsquo;s price of $0.32.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most optimistic Decentraland price prediction for 2025 would be for MANA to return back to its November 2021 highs, or somewhere between $5 and $6. The more realistic Decentraland price prediction for 2025 would be around $3.50 to $4.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade (MCADE) is an Immensely Undervalued Metaverse Project</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Sandbox, Metacade, and Decentraland are all likely to do well over the next few years as more users join the metaverse. But while the ship has probably already sailed for massive gains in SAND or MANA, MCADE has everything to gain. With the token still in stage 1 of presale, there couldn&rsquo;t be a better time to get in. Already, Metacade has sold over $1.55m in MCADE, and this number is expected to reach at least $20 million by the end of presale. Don&rsquo;t wait &ndash; grab your share of MCADE before it&rsquo;s too late!</p>
