The lawsuit in question charged Hydro Technology Corp. and its former CEO Michael Ross Kane for their roles in effectuating the unregistered offers and sales of crypto securities called “Hydro”. Additionally, they were alleged to perpetrate a scheme to manipulate the trading volume and price of those securities, which generated more than $2 million for Hydrogen.</p>
<h2>SEC Settles Big With Hydrogen</h2>
<p>On Thursday, a New York federal judge approved a settlement agreement between the SEC and Miami-based Hydrogen Technology Corp. Co-founder and former CEO Michael Kane also consented to end the legal dispute. In September, the regulatory body filed a lawsuit against two individuals, alleging that they had paid a third party to manipulate trade of the company&#8217;s Hydro token in order to artificially boost its price. The day after the complaint was brought forward, the third party in question, Tyler Ostern, reached an agreement to settle the case for $41,000.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Satoshi Era Bitcoin Wallet Comes To Life, Moves $7.8 Million After Decade Of Dormancy" href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-satoshi-era-bitcoin-wallet-comes-to-life/" rel="bookmark">Satoshi Era Bitcoin Wallet Comes To Life, Moves $7.8 Million After Decade Of Dormancy</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Hydrogen has consented to pay a total of nearly $2.8 million, comprised of nearly $1.5 million in disgorged profits &#8212; which refers to the profits yielded from illegal or wrongful conduct &#8212; a penalty of more than $1 million, and prejudgment interest. Michael Kane, on the other hand, has agreed to pay a fine of approximately $260,000.</p>
<h2>Strict Terms Set For Hydrogen</h2>
<p>Both the corporation and Kane are bound by the conditions of the settlement, which stipulates that they cannot confirm nor refute the claims that have been leveled against them. Additionally, they will not be allowed to sell any additional <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> unless they have passed a Howey test and received SEC approval. However, Kane will still be able to engage in the broader <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/?utm_source=menubar">crypto market</a>, where he could continue trading cryptocurrencies for himself.</p>
<p>According to the complaint filed by the SEC, Michael Kane, who also controlled Hedgeable Inc &#8212; an SEC registered investment adviser &#8212; needed to obtain fresh capital, which led to the formation of Hydrogen in the peak <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/">bull market</a> of December 2017. On January 2018, Hydrogen minted more than 11 billion Hydro tokens which were distributed through giveaways to its employees, retail investors and to those who promoted the project as a reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1600" height="1120" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/09224431/altcoins3.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Today" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low Cap Assets are always one of the crucial parts of a balanced portfolio. These gems can be bought at a discounted price and offer massive returns during bull runs. Thus, today we’ll analyze three Low Cap cryptocurrencies with a strong bullish setup that hold massive growth potential in the near future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MultiversX(EGLD)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/AzIwyJ6Y.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/multiversx/">MultiversX coin</a> price shows the formation of an inverted head and shoulder pattern. This pattern consists of a large swing low- the head, and two shorter swing lows- the shoulders and key resistance called the neckline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the coin price currently trades at $39.9 and trying to sustain above local support of $39.5. If the coin price manages to sustain above the aforementioned support, the buyers may drive a 15% rally to challenge the pattern’s resistance trendline. Thus, a potential breakout from the trendline will signal an early sign of a trend change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Ideal conditions, the neckline breakout may push the EDLG price to the $69.3 mark</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immutable(IMX)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/sUSOO56Q.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to EGLD, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/immutablex/">Immutable price</a> has been forming an inverted head and shoulder pattern for the past 11 months. This pattern is one of the most commonly observed reversal patterns at market bottoms, offering long entry opportunities upon the breakout of neckline resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IMX price is currently forming the right shoulder pattern of the pattern, which may find support at $0.94 or $0.8. By the press time, this altcoin traded at $0.957 with an intraday loss of 1.54%. If the coin price manages to sustain above the aforementioned support, the buyers would replenish the bullish momentum and rise back to the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under favorable conditions, a breakout above the trendline will drive the price to $2.846.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-cryptocurrencies-to-buy/">15 New Cryptocurrencies To Buy In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arweave(AR)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EwuD8Di6.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past nine months, the Arweave(AR) has been in a steady downtrend under the influence of two converging trendlines. In the weekly time frame chart, these trend lines reveal the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/falling-wedge-pattern-what-to-do-if-it-appears-on-a-crypto-chart/">falling wedge pattern</a>, which offers a massive upswing upon the breakout of the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the AR price traders at $7.85 and is chasing the lower support trendline of this pattern. Anyhow, interested buyers can look for any entry opportunity when the price rebounds from the support trendline or breach the overhead resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful breakout from this pattern could lead the AR price to the $17.68 mark.</span></p>

However, a number of them later refuted the claims and dissociated themselves from any form of involvement with the exchange.</p>
<h2>VCs Deny Any Investments</h2>
<p>DRW and Nascent, two of the many investors identified, have both denied claims that they were investors in OPNX, which was initiated by the owners of 3AC. Following the exchange&#8217;s announcement, DRW explicitly stated that there was no participation from the parent company or any of its subsidiaries.</p>

<p>Nascent, on the other hand, provided a response to a question on OPNX&#8217;s ongoing Twitter thread  &#8212; claiming to have invested in FLEX tokens two years back rather than in OPNX.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just to clarify, Nascent did not participate in an OPNX fundraising round, we invested in FLEX tokens in early 2021.</p>
<p>&mdash; Nascent (@nascentxyz) <a href="https://twitter.com/nascentxyz/status/1649464652102004737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Who&#8217;s Saying The Truth?</h2>
<p>OPNX was formerly known as CoinFlex, a trading platform which is currently undergoing reorganization in Seychelles. In early 2023, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies collaborated with CoinFlex to establish their new <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> that trades bankruptcy claims instead of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>. Now, since DRW and Nascent had previously been investors in CoinFlex, the 3AC duo claimed to have them as investors for their venture as well &#8212; which if technically examined isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>OPNX earlier mentioned that some of its backers included investors like the high-frequency trading firm Susquehanna and the Taiwanese venture capital firm AppWorks. Apart from them, the firm mentioned a number of other investors in the thread including MIAX Group, Token Bay Capital and Tuwaiq, which is a digital asset fund based in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>In the wake of this news, CoinFlex&#8217;s FLEX token which serves as the native token of the OPNX platform, dropped by 17.09% in the past one hour and is currently trading at around $1.04 at the time of writing.</p>

Users of Telegram who make use of the wallet bot were informed today of a new feature that made it possible for anyone to purchase, withdraw, exchange and make P2P transactions utilizing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<h2>Telegram Adds Support For Bitcoin</h2>
<p>According to the recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://t.me/wallet" rel="nofollow">notification</a>, users could now perform multiple operations with Bitcoin through Telegram&#8217;s web interface, while an app-based update is currently under development.

<p>The notification also served to inform users that the platform&#8217;s &#8220;Exchange&#8221; had been modified and as a result, they are now able to instantaneously trade Bitcoin, Tether (USDT), and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ton/">Telegram Open Network (TON)</a> with one another.</p>

A testnet version of the Ethereum <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/top-layer-2-crypto-projects-to-watch-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Layer 2 network</a> has been unveiled in February 2023. Base was <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-coinbase-base-layer-2-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> as a platform that makes it easy for developers to build apps and plug into the Coinbase product suite for user convenience. The developers said in a latest update that the Base mainnet is being considered as a priority.</p>

<h2>Base Mainnet Launch</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, a Coinbase executive spilled the beans on the potential timeline for Base mainnet launch. The mainnet launch is planned for 2023, as the team is prioritizing for delivering it as soon as possible. However, the official dates for the launch are yet to be ascertained. Jesse Pollak, the Base lead, said the overall vision is to unite builders and users on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The Ethereum layer 2 blockchain comes as a potential rival to existing layer 2 blockchains, considering the wide reach of the crypto exchange. Pollak <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/coinbases-layer-2-blockchain-base-plans-for-2023-mainnet-launch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> the launch is now a number one priority, as per a TechCrunch report:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s coming soon, we are working hard on it. It’s our number one priority alongside decentralization goals and the rest of the year is really about making sure we get there as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The executive said the larger plan is to unite Base along with Coinbase to bring &#8220;million developers and billions of users on chain.&#8221;</p>

After witnessing multiple reversals from this dynamic resistance, a bullish breakout is an early sign of trend reversal which could drive the SOL price for a massive rally. As of now, the coin price is retesting this breached trendline validating whether this breakout is genuine or not.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solana price hints at a temporary pullback to $21.68 or $19.8 before the bull run continue </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multiple support concentrated near the $21.8 level offers a strong accumulation zone for Solana buyers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $510.2 Million, indicating a 15.2% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/P8CoM5Ym.png" alt="SOL Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/solana/#:~:text=Solana%20is%20spotted%20trading%20at,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">Solana coin price</a> turned down from a local resistance of $26 on April 17. This correction has tumbled the coin price by 16.5% in the last five days and plunged to its current price of $22.19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $21.68 and the breached trendline level at $19.8 are two crucial support that potential buyers should keep their eyes on. If the coin price manages to sustain above these supports, the recuperating bullish momentum will bolster buyers to kick-start a new recovery rally.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-crypto-exchanges-for-recurring-purchases/">Best Crypto Exchanges For Recurring Purchases In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained buying, the Solana price may rise to potential targets of $26, $30.5, and $34.5 which is 100% growth as per Trend-based Fibonacci Extension tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below $19.8 could undermine the aforementioned bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative strength index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> plunged below the midline indicating the negative sentiment in the market is rising.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a> (50 and 100) wavering around the $21.68 level offer additional support to prevent a bearish breakdown.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Coin Price Intraday Level</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $22.03</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>

The on-chain research platform Lookonchain <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1649387289745977344" rel="nofollow">reports</a> that the wallet was credited with a total of 1,128 Bitcoins in the months of October 2012 and May 2013. When those transactions took place, the price of one Bitcoin was roughly around $12 and $195 respectively.</p>
<h2>Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Moves 279 BTC</h2>
<p>Taking into account the price of Bitcoin at the time of writing, the amount of Bitcoin that is stored in the <a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-crypto-wallets-for-security-in-2023/">crypto wallet</a> would translate to be around roughly 31 million USD. This comes on the heels of another bitcoin whale transferring 2,071.5 BTC yesterday &#8212; which is equivalent to 60.7 million USD &#8212; after a lengthy nine-year hiatus.</p>

<p>While many fear an incoming BTC dump due to such developments, most of the transactions have been made to other standalone Bitcoin wallets rather than <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchanges</a>.</p>
<h2>Reason Behind Reawakening?</h2>
<p>Although the fact that the cause for the move is unknown, there is widespread conjecture that some long-time crypto HODLers are moving old funds to new <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wallet-address/">wallet addresses</a> in the midst of a massive wallet-draining operation that is purportedly targeting old wallets. On the other hand, some users opine it to be a normal movement of funds to wallets like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/hardware-wallets-are-they-safe/">hardware wallets</a> which tend to offer greater security.</p>
<p>On Friday, the price of Bitcoin dipped below $28,000 for a short period of time as the broader <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">crypto market</a> continued its decline for three consecutive days. In the wake of this crypto news, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin’s price</a> is currently exchanging hands at $28,110 which represents a drop of 1.15% over the past 24 hours in comparison to a loss of 6.87% recorded over the past seven days.</p>

The community believes Terra Rebels mismanaged funds provided earlier for the Rebel Station and caused FUD that caused LUNC price to fall massively.</p>
<h2>LUNC Proposal By Terra Rebels Almost Passed</h2>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-community-remains-divided-on-key-proposal-lunc-price-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 11459 by Terra Rebels</a> was almost passed, but validator Allnodes, with 15% voting power, voted “No” on the proposal. Allnodes said it voted “No” on Proposal 11459 due to a lack of transparency on nodes deployed and requests being handled by Terra Rebels.</p>
<p>Terra Rebels has provided all details including nodes and servers handling endpoint scalability and distributed storage. Terra Classic validator Allnodes has also stress-tested Terra Rebels&#8217; infrastructure by diverting all volume of Allnodes&#8217; public node to Terra Rebels. The test has been successful and Allnodes support Rebel Station.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Terra Classic blockchain requires at least two independent endpoints. While there is still plenty of room for growth, I think that currently Terra Rebels endpoint is a good choice as backup endpoint for Terra Classic blockchain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After Allnodes voted &#8220;Yes&#8221;, the proposal is almost passed with 2 days still remaining. The Proposal 11479 has received 47% in favor, with 41% &#8220;No&#8221; and 12% &#8220;No with veto&#8221; votes. Other 13 validators including MAX, JESUSisLORD, Autism Staking, and Crypto Genesis support the proposal. Whereas, 13 validators such as TCB, Luna Station 88, HappyCattyCrypto, and LUNC DAO rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>Terra Rebels is seeking $37,593 worth of LUNC tokens from the community pool, with $7,593 for running costs and $30,000 for wages. The funds will help with running costs and technical support of Rebel Station Infrastructure for 3 months.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic (LUNC) Price Breaks Below Support Level</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNC price</a> fell 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.000113. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000112 and $0.000115, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has decreased by 11% in the last 24 hours, indicating a decline in interest among traders.</p>
<p>Terra Classic has broken below the key support level of 0.00012 as the community is <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-core-developers-edward-kim-zaradar-leave-joint-l1-task-force/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing a crisis</a> as core developers <strong>Ed Kim</strong> and <strong>Tobias “Zaradar” Andersen </strong>left the Joint L1 Task Force developer team.</p>

Although it is very early into the development, it is not clear as to whether Google is trying to become the top AI chatbot for software professionals while OpenAI&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> is developed for general purposes. The search engine giant said coding has been on top of its list of requests from our users for embedding into the AI service.</p>

<h2>Google Bard For Software Developers</h2>
<p>In a fresh <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">update</a> on its generative AI project, Google said Bard can assist developers in tasks like code generation, debugging and code explanation. Bard can help craft SQL queries for user database, translate software from one language to another, debug lines of source code and explain code line by line. However, the company warned that Bard is still in early stages and that it may sometimes provide inaccurate, misleading or false information.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are launching these capabilities in more than 20 programming languages including C++, Go, Java, Javascript, Python and Typescript. And you can easily export Python code to Google Colab — no copy and paste required.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, ChatGPT, on the other hand, can also demystify technical content like software code in laymen terms, while also helping in fixing coding errors. With Google&#8217;s large range of G Suite products and its strength in reach among software professionals, Bard could potentially have an early advantage in the coding assist space.

This breached level was supposed to bolster buyers for further recovery but the broader market sell-off plunged the price back below the $2000 mark again. On April 19th, a massive outflow in <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">ETH price</a> formed a massive daily red candle which may have forced liquidated aggressive buyers with narrow stop loss, fueling more selling pressure in the market.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing correction phase in Ethereum price may face significant demand pressure at $1780</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily EMAs(50, 100, and 200) may offer dynamic support to resume a bullish recovery</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $11.4 Billion, indicating a 2.74% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/x/xhIMxwnu.png" alt="ETH Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the increasing selling pressure in the market, the Ethereum price has witnessed a 9% drop in the last three days and plunged to the current price of $1913. With this downfall, the coin holders lost the 23.6% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement</a> and a support trendline maintaining sustained recovery in ETH price for the last four weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a breakdown below the dynamic support will likely accelerate selling pressure in the market and tumble the Ethereum price more 7-8% down to hit the combined support of $1780 and 50% FIB level.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-cryptocurrencies-to-buy/">15 New Cryptocurrencies To Buy In 2023</a>e</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This high area of interest may assist buyers in sustaining the higher levels of the chart and resuming the prior recovery. Thus, the $1780 is a key level to watch in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While overall the price trend remains bullish a breakdown below $1780 will gradually weaken the buyers’ grip over the Ethereum price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sell signal from the bearish crossover between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and the signal(orange) line hints at prolonged correction in ETH price.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the ascending support trendline, the Ethereum price breached below the 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> offering an additional edge in the short-seller&#8217;s favor.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1915</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $2000 and $2140</span></li>

While the bigwigs of <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> pinned their hopes on gaining an edge over regulatory agencies through legal proceedings, Clayton said courts are after all not efficient in clearing the air around securities Vs commodities differentiation. He made the comments at the back of Gensler&#8217;s failure to answer specifically on whether Ethereum (ETH) is a security or commodity.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/banks-vcs-pension-funds-once-crypto-friendly-steering-away-from-crypto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Banks, VCs, Pension Funds Once Crypto-Friendly Steering Away From Crypto</strong></a></p>
<p>During the recent House Financial Services Committee hearing, Gary Gensler <a href="https://coingape.com/gary-gensler-hearing-crypto-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dodged</a> the question on explaining how crypto firms should comply with the laws. The Committee Chair Patrick McHenry came down heavily against Gensler&#8217;s stance that existing securities laws are already compatible with the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Jay Clayton Supports Gensler</h2>
<p>Speaking about the state of the crypto market and the debate around regulation, Clayton said securities can eventually become commodities but currently many cryptocurrencies appear to be securities. He explained that these assets now give a first mover advantage to early investors in crypto projects, hence acting as securities. During a discussion on CNBC on Friday, he also <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/TimR614/status/1649389078415015937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The courts are not an efficient place to resolve classification issues around securities and commodities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>His comments attracted criticism from the crypto community, which was buoyed by the Gensler&#8217;s grilling on lack of clarity during the Congressional hearing. Meanwhile, the US regulators are facing fresh wave of angst after the European Union&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/eu-parliament-votes-in-to-pass-mica-bitcoin-drops-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting</a> to pass the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA is touted as the first comprehensive rules for digital crypto asset service providers.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price To Decline More Ahead</h2>
<p>Mike McGlone, Senior Macro Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11/status/1649376033362042880" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> Bitcoin (BTC) and <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH) may</a> be running into a wall of resistance ahead. However, Bitcoin price went surged over the $30K level to encounter multiple resistance. Same with ETH, the second largest crypto price breached the $2K level but faced multiple resistances there.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Analyst is still bullish on the biggest of the cryptos in the long term. Meanwhile, a force generated by the dropping stock market in accordance with the tightening Federal Reserve policies leading to recession holds the potential to lower the tide for all the risk assets. He marks Bitcoin and Ethereum among the riskiest assets.</p>
<p>As per the data, $30,000 and $2,000 have been pivotal points for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. McGlone mentioned that the diminishing supply and low and increasing adoption make the bullish case in the long term. However, growing consensus shows that worse is over ahead of a U.S. recession. It is indicated by the yield curve at the highest probability since 1982.</p>

As a result, the coin price falling for three consecutive days has registered an 8% drop and plunged to the current price of $28065. Moreover, this recent downfall also breached a support trendline of a rising channel pattern, indicating a higher possibility of a significant correction. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple technical support concentrate near the $27000 creates a strong accumulation zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Breakdown below $27000 will put Bitcoin price under 7.3% downside risk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $21.5 Billion, indicating a 7% gain</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last four weeks, the Bitcoin price witnessed a sustained recovery under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">rising channel pattern</a>. The buyers have been using this dynamic support as stepping stones to reclaim the higher levels of the chart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, amid the increasing selling pressure, the BTC price breached the pattern’s support trendline on April 20th. As of now, the coin price trades at $28065 but with sustained selling the coin holders would likely witness another 4% to reach $27000.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned support aligned with the 0.236 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> and 50-day EMA offers a significant footing for buyers to prevent further loss. If the Bitcoin price manages to sustain above the $27000 support, a new higher low formation could bolster the resumption of prevailing recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below $27000 with a daily closing will tumble the price 7.3% and plunge it to the $25200 level.</span></p>

Former US Secret Service Agent Jeremy A. Sheridan <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://document.epiq11.com/document/getdocumentsbydocket/?docketId=999153&amp;projectCode=FTX&amp;docketNumber=1325&amp;source=DM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> anonymity for creditors citing risks of identity theft or unlawful injury.</p>
<h2>FTX Debtors and Creditors Filed Motion To Keep Names Anonymous</h2>
<p>According to a court <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://dm.epiq11.com/case/ftx/dockets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing</a> dated April 20, FTX and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors submitted a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The motion aims to redact and withhold the names, addresses, and e-mail addresses of any creditors or entity.</p>
<p>The Debtors and Committee <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/FTX_Committee/status/1649241295301271552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe</a> the names of customers who are natural persons should be kept private to protect them from potential harm caused by scams and other threats. The Court has already ordered that customers’ email and physical addresses be sealed.</p>
<p>Former US Secret Service Agent Jeremy A. Sheridan, who is managing director of FTI Consulting Inc, filed a declaration in support of the motion. FTI Consulting is the financial adviser for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors.</p>
<p>Sheridan asserts identifying FTX customers imposes a severe and unusual risk of identity theft, asset theft, personal attack, and further online victimization.</p>
<p>The US Trustee and media companies, including Bloomberg, claimed to make the names of FTX customers public, arguing that it would help identify if the individuals are creditors in any other bankruptcy case. However, the Bankruptcy Code authorizes a court to protect an individual&#8217;s details as it may lead to identity theft or unlawful harm.</p>

From the last swing high of $0.586, the prices have tumbled around 20% which pulled it to the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> at $0.47. This support level accompanied by other technical levels could bolster coin buyers to resume a bullish rally. Should you grab this pullback opportunity now?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple supports aligned at $0.47 could bolster buyers for a minor upswing of 5%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price may maintain its overall bullish outlook until the 0.618 FIB level at $0.43 is intact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.52 Billion, indicating a 5.59% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Bitcoin price failing to sustain above the $30000 psychological support, the crypto market faced additional selling pressure this week. As a result, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> has been falling for three consecutive days and plunged to its current price of $0.4709.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the coin price is currently hovering above a concentrated support zone protected by $0.47 horizontal, 0.5 FIB, and 50-day EMA slope. This combined support could offer a significant footing for buyers to push the coin’s market value higher.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-cryptocurrencies-to-buy/">15 New Cryptocurrencies To Buy In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the decreasing volume and increasing lower price rejection candles increase the possibility of price reversal. Thus, the altcoin price will likely rise 5% and hit the $0.496 flipped resistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle between buyers and bears at this aforementioned level will significantly influence XRP’s future price as a breakout above it will signal an uptrend continuation but a possible reversal may form a new lower high and encourage further correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the coin holders should be watchful at the $0.496 barrier.</span></p>
<p>On a contrary note, a daily candle closing below the $0.47 level will tumble the coin price 7.5% down to reach $0.43 support.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>RSI: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> plunged below the midline indicating a negative sentiment is rising among market participants.</span></p>
<p><b>EMAs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 100-and-200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a> wavering near the $0.43 level created a crucial support zone to maintain an overall bullish trend in XRP price.</span></p>
