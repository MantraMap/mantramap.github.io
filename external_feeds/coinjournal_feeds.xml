										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dubai, UAE, 10th January, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p>Flare, the blockchain for building applications that use data from other chains and the internet, has successfully completed its long-awaited token airdrop at 11:59 pm UTC on January 9th. The airdrop saw 4.279B Flare (FLR) tokens distributed to millions of recipients, including users on Binance, OKX, Kraken, Bithumb, UpBit, Kucoin, BitBank, &amp; more, in one of the largest scale distributions in crypto history.</p>
<p>The airdrop is a significant milestone for Flare as developers can now start to take advantage of Flare&rsquo;s EVM and native data acquisition protocols, the State Connector and Flare Time Series Oracle. These native protocols, secured by the network, provide decentralized access to high-integrity data from other blockchains and the internet, enabling the creation of new use cases and monetization models.</p>
<p><i>Hugo Philion, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Flare said,&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;For the blockchain industry to flourish, we need more useful decentralized applications. Flare is tackling this through data, not just prices but transaction details, Web2 events etc, so that developers can build applications that provide more utility to a larger group of users.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Hugo continues, &ldquo;Flare&rsquo;s objective is to enable developers to build applications that securely access more data. This could enable new use cases to be built, such as triggering a Flare smart contract action with a payment made on another chain, or with input from an internet/web2 API. It also facilitates a new way of bridging, specifically to bring non-smart contract tokens to Flare for use in applications like DeFi protocols.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Flare&rsquo;s <a href="https://flare.network/stateconnector/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>State Connector</u></a> protocols enable information to be used securely, scalably and trustlessly with smart contracts on Flare. This offers the most powerful class of data on the network and enables more cross-chain solutions to be built. The State Connector derives its safety from combining a decentralized set of attestors with a binary forking protocol, which allows for a malicious majority of data providers to be challenged. In contrast to a proof of stake based system where data providers are obliged to stake value, the security of the State Connector is not limited by the amount staked in the system. This means that the State Connector is invariant in its safety relative to the size of a transaction, this offers a secure system capable of handling large amounts of value.<br>
The <a href="https://flare.network/ftso/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Flare Time Series Oracle</u></a> (FTSO) utilizes the network structure to deliver highly decentralized prices and data series to dapps on Flare without relying on centralized data providers. The FTSO is a highly decentralized data feed oracle, with almost 100 independent data providers incentivized to provide reliable data every 3 minutes.</p>
<p>The Flare token distribution represents the first 15% of the full public token distribution, with the remainder to be distributed on a monthly basis over 36 months. The method of allocation of the remaining 85% of token supply depends on the outcome of a community vote on <a href="https://flare.network/fip01/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Flare Improvement Proposal 01 (FIP.01)</u></a>.</p>
<p><b>About Flare</b><br>
<a href="https://flare.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Flare</u></a> is the Layer 1 oracle network that allows developers to build applications that are interoperable with blockchains and the internet. By providing decentralized access to high-integrity data, Flare enables new use cases and monetisation models.</p>
<p>Flare&rsquo;s <a href="https://flare.network/stateconnector/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>State Connector</u></a> protocols enable information, both from other blockchains and the internet to be used securely, scalably and trustlessly with smart contracts on Flare.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Litecoin is attempting to break above $80</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The upcoming halving event is seen to boost the price</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A successful breakout will see buyers eye the next resistance at $100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">If you have been eyeing&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/what-is-litecoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Litecoin</u></a> (LTC/USD), it is time to get even more curious, as the latest price action looks exciting. The area around $80 was a stumbling block to Litecoin during its bullish rally in November. Bears took the chance to push the price lower, retesting the $64 support but bulls resuscitated thereafter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, the former is seemingly winning as Litecoin attempts to clear the $80 barrier. The cryptocurrency surged to $82, although it is not clear if the daily candlestick will close above to consider a breakout. Should a bullish market be confirmed, a journey to $100 looks very likely. Investors would better watch how the price action plays out next.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you might have missed it, you could refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/litecoin-shoots-high-after-a-breakout-why-you-should-buy-ltc-in-a-bear-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CoinJournal analysis</u></a> on how Litecoin&rsquo;s halving event is influencing price. But aside from this critical event, Litecoin could draw from the slightly improved crypto sentiment to force a breakout. Most cryptocurrencies have staged recoveries as of press time. So how will you tell if a breakout has occurred in LTC price?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>LTC surges with higher momentums at $80</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/09/1673296203519-88eca86c-9e72-4c8f-8e3c-fc656b3edc71.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="269"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>LTC/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">On the daily chart technical outlook, momentum is very strong for LTC. The daily candlestick is piercing through the $80 resistance zone. There is a surge in the buy-side volumes, indicating buyers are very active on LTC. The price also stays clear of the moving averages and ascending trendline.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>When to consider a breakout?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">LTC must clear $80, with the daily candlestick closing above, to consider a successful breakout. If the price closes above this crucial level, buyers may get attracted. LTC could surge to nearly $100, the potential resistance zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the contrary, if the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20LTC%20today,trading%20volume%20of%20%24347.83M." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>LTC price</u></a> closes below $80, the token could be due for a correction. We consider the former a more likely scenario but investors should be open to both.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency has maintained an uptrend</p>

<p dir="ltr">A break above $1,250 sets ETH to $16,000 with short-term corrections at $1,350 and $1,450</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Relief rallies are here, and even before we go further,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ethereum</u></a> (ETH/USD) is back above $1,300. To a crypto native, this price level should inform you that Ethereum has overcome a resistance hurdle at $1,250. We have seen it happen before, cryptocurrencies breaking key levels and crashing below them afterward. That&rsquo;s when you recognise how volatile digital assets are. But of course, you do not want to miss on slight opportunities as they emerge, and Ethereum could be one of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trading up 4.66% as of press time, Ethereum was again showing why investors should never lose hope. Ethereum has been regarded as the home of decentralised finance and non-fungible tokens. Analysts expect these two nascent sectors to continue growing despite getting it rough in 2022. So, timing your investment in Ethereum is all you need, both short and long-term. But is the recent rally an indication of the start of a bullish market?</p>
<p dir="ltr">We would be too cautious about calling a bullish market for Ethereum and any other crypto now. However, as ETH price action shows, $16,000 could be the inevitable target only if&hellip;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Ethereum price outlook and analysis</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/09/1673295402095-b4cb4d06-baf1-44ee-be0c-1f1ec1ff559a.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="270"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ETH/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum&rsquo;s price outlook shows it has overcome resistance at $1,250. The momentum has increased significantly since the breakout. The moving averages now support the price, with the 20-day MA attempting to close above the 50-day MA. Ethereum has maintained movement above the short-term ascending trendline and trades with higher highs and higher lows.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for ETH?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20ETH%20today,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ethereum price</u></a> is set for the $1,350 level in the current bullish run. A break above this zone will see buyers target $1,450 next. Still, we set a price target at or above $1,600, the established resistance. For ETH to hit the price level, bulls must keep price above the ascending trendline and moving averages. However, short-term corrections are expected at the near-term resistances of $1,350 and $1,450.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency industry was valued close to $3 trillion entering 2022, now it is $800 billion&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">There are 73% less Bitcoin millionaires after 2022</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin has pulled back 75% from its all-time high of close to $69,000</li>
<li dir="ltr">25% of the bitcoin supply was in a loss entering the year, now it is over 50%</li>
<li dir="ltr">Number of investors holding greater than 1 BTC jumped 20% as the hurdle became much more attainable</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once upon a time, the cryptocurrency market was valued at $3 trillion. To be precise, this was in November 2021, when <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> traded at its all-time high of close to $69,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But then along came 2022. Inflation sparked as a result of the COVID money printing, war in Ukraine and supply chain issues, meaning central banks worldwide were forced to hike rates to curtail a spiralling cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the cheap liquidity pulled out from under markets, Bitcoin &ndash; and crypto as a whole &ndash; felt the pinch. We have seen top 10 cryptocurrencies collapse, one of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-cryptocurrency-exchanges/"><u>top exchanges</u></a> revealed to be a house of cards and numerous other bankruptcies and scandals.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The loss has been greater than $2 trillion, with Bitcoin shedding three-quarters of its value as at the time of writing, trading at $16,800.</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12355643">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin millionaires</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at on-chain data from bitinfocharts.com, Bitcoin millionaires have dropped like flies. Entering 2022, there were 90,000 addresses containing over a million dollars worth of Bitcoin. Today, it is 24,000 &ndash; that amounts to a fall of 73%.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;The on-chain data sums up what is glaringly obvious from looking at a Bitcoin price chart &ndash; that the party is over and investors are no longer dreaming of retirement off their Bitcoin holdings, in the near future at least! Nearly three-quarters of Bitcoin millionaires losing that status is perhaps the best piece of data of all to summarise how ugly 2022 was for investors&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>said Max Coupland, Director at CoinJournal.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Percent in supply in loss doubles in 2022</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s returns before 2022 were astonishing. As a result, the bulk of the supply was in profit, with only 25% of the supply loss-making entering the year. By year-end, this had doubled to over 50% &ndash; another stunning statistic when considering that Bitcoin was the best-performing asset class in the world over the prior decade.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12356431">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2 dir="ltr">Addresses holding greater than 1 BTC</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On the flipside, with Bitcoin being so cheap compared to last year, the number of addresses containing one Bitcoin or greater &ndash; &ldquo;whole coiners&rdquo;, as they are known &ndash; is at all-time high, even if the dollar value contained in those addresses is way down.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12355736">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Entering 2022, there were over 814,000 addresses holding more than 1 BTC. By the end of the year, this number was over 978,000 &ndash; that is a rise of 20%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As can be seen when zooming in on 2022 on the below chart, there were significant jumps when Bitcoin plunged off the back of the three major scandals of 2022 &ndash; Luna&rsquo;s death spiral, Celsius&rsquo; insolvency and the revelations of fraud at FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12355775">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2 dir="ltr">Dropping sentiment matching falling prices</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps the biggest problem emerging from 2022 is related to these scandals. The reputation of crypto has taken a hammer blow, most notably with the shocking downfall of FTX and disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a CNBC survey as of November 2022, only 8% of Americans now have a positive view of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto investors have seen similar percentage declines before, of course, only for the market to bounce back. But this time, crypto is fighting against a pullback in the wider economy for the first time in its history.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until now, it had been zero (or negative) interest rates and a warm money printer. Now, we have transitioned to a new environment, and crypto investors are feeling the pain. They will hope that 2023 can bring a return to prominence and start mending the reputation of the wounded asset class.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Solana token has added nearly 50% of value in a week</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The gains come amid the BONK token launch</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">SOL has overcome a resistance and eyes higher level if it closes above key zone</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">For the first time since the crash orchestrated by the FTX, Solana (SOL/USD) has recovered above the 50-day moving average. That comes as the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20SOL%20today,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SOL price</u></a> has risen by nearly 50% in the past week, outperforming other major cryptocurrencies at the top. SOL has also recovered above the $15 resistance, giving buyers hopes of a further upside. The fundamentals are good too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto analytics Token Termina shows that the daily active users on Solana continued to rise in January. Since the start of 2023, the number of active users has increased by 55.9% or 56,000 to 160,000. That suggests that users have not given up on the proclaimed Ethereum killer, which had a set of challenges last year. There are reasons for this rise in active users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bonk Inu, or simply BONK, continues to attract fans. Launched just a week and a half ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bonk-price-has-soared-prepare-for-a-major-dive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BONK</u></a> has been a crypto sensation, with the dog-themed cryptocurrency rising by four digits in value. The token is based on the Solana network. On its Twitter page, Bonk regards itself as the &ldquo;first Solana Dog Coin for the people and by the people.&rdquo; The hype around this token&rsquo;s launch has given Solana network airtime and attracted users.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Moving averages joint support for SOL&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/09/1673285215340-207bcb6a-4c8a-4e0a-8739-e4ec628c179b.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="272"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SOL/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Technically, Solana has crossed above a crucial resistance at $15. Bulls have failed to break above this key level since early November 2022. Also, the price has moved above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages for the first time since November. A RSI reading of 72 shows an intensified buying of SOL.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Likely price action for SOL</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">SOL is clearly overbought, as shown by the RSI reading of 72, and could correct downwards. However, we remain optimistic the upside will be maintained to the $18 level as momentum is strong. For the bullish surge to be maintained, SOL must overcome $18. That could set the cryptocurrency for longer-lasting rallies to the $28 zone.</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Web3 market size will grow at a CAGR of nearly 45% between 2022 and 2030, according to research firm Straits Research.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Web3 is the new iteration of the internet and will benefit from further developments in blockchain technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>Growth opportunities are there in areas such as browsing, social media and data storage.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the 2022 crypto winter&rsquo;s impact, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/web-3-0/">Web3</a> market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 44.8% over the next eight years. While North America remains the largest market for Web3, Asia Pacific is the fastest growing.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Web 3 market growth forecast 2022-2030</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Web3 market saw significant growth in 2021, with the blockchain industry overall in bullish territory as cryptocurrency prices skyrocketed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Straits Research, the Web3 market size stood at $1.8 billion in 2021. However, with the 2022 bear market wreaking havoc on the entire industry, interest and activity slowed down considerably. The next few years will see the Web3 blockchain market grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44.8%&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Per the latest <a href="https://straitsresearch.com/report/web-3-0-blockchain-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> on Web3 growth, the period 2022-2030 will see the next evolution phase of the third-generation of the internet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Straits Research says the industry will get fresh impetus from developments across three key pillars: artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and blockchain technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As <em>CoinJournal</em> <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/blockchain-technology-has-big-plans-despite-bloodbath-in-the-markets/">previously highlighted</a>, blockchain remains central to crypto growth, and as Straits Reseach notes, its a key pillar to Web3. In particular, adoption of decentralised protocols across Web3 businesses is going to be big as the technology comes out of the R&amp;D phase over the next year or so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, the main growth opportunities are across sectors such as browsing, social media and data storage, according to Straits Research. Web3 has indeed already seen significant growth in NFT payments and digital collectibles and will continue to play a huge role in other sectors, including spatial web design and 3D graphics.</p>

<li>The fund retrieval solution will allow customers to retrieve funds trapped on the platform.</li>
<li>The solution will be executed by a third-party law firm together with a third-party management company.</li>
<li>Customers will have the liberty to choose between the existing solution and the new solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>AEX crypto exchange has unveiled a new fund retrieval solution for customers. Customers will now be able to choose between the new solution and the previous &ldquo;soft payment&rdquo; strategy proposed in December 2022 in retrieving funds trapped on its platform.</p>
<p>After launching the new solution the exchange claimed that the essence of the new solution is to increase the customers&rsquo; choices to speed up the fund retrieval process.</p>
<p>AEX crypto exchange is suffering from the ripple effect of the collapsed Three Arrows Capital (3AC) in addition in addition to the complexities of being forced to relocate from China after the country clamped down on crypto activities.</p>
<h2>What the new solution entails</h2>
<p>The new solution will have three specific measures to simplify the fund retrieval process. The exchange believes that adopting these measures will better protect the rights and interests of its customers.</p>
<p>Some of the other measures that have been taken by AEX include transferring part of the project&rsquo;s rights to the client at a lower discount through a third-party law firm with the help of a third-party management company.</p>
<p>Customers using the new solution will be required to fill in their real names and sign the equity purchase contract provided by the exchange. They shall also be required to fill in a &ldquo;Qualified Investor Questionnaire&rdquo; and then send a certain amount of Acala Dollar (AUSD) to a black hole address for destruction based on newly designed rules.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>XVM is now available on public testnet</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Astar Network, the smart contract platform for multichain, announced on Monday, January 9th, that it has launched its Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM) functionality on the public testnet Shibuya.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a press release shared with Coinjournal, Astar Network said XVM gives projects building on its network seamless interoperability between different smart contract environments such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">XVM is a custom pallet and a set of interfaces that allow a smart contract in one virtual machine to communicate with another as if they are in the same environment. The XVM testnet can make bi-directional calls between EVM and WASM smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> is the first major product launch as part of Astar Network&rsquo;s 2023 starmap.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While commenting on the public testnet launch of XVM, Hoon Kim, Chief Technology Officer at Astar Network, said;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working hard to create the foundation of the future, regardless of outside influences that are happening now. And today, I am proud to introduce one of our most important features to achieve the Astar Vision; the Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM). It will be the start of the next wave of innovation for dApps. Astar will not only have interoperability through XCM (Cross-chain Messaging) with other parachains but also have interoperability between different smart contract environments. &rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Developers can experiment with the XVM developer kit</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Astar Network explained that with the XVM, smart contracts would work seamlessly regardless of which language they are written with or which smart contract environment they use.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the feature would allow developers to build their cross-chain projects and experiment with the XVM developer toolkit, something they were never able to do. Developers can also tap into the user bases and assets across multiple smart contract environments rather than being stuck with just one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The XVM functionality allows developers to create numerous complex applications that have various use cases beyond merely bridging liquidity from EVM to WASM. The launch comes just three weeks after&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/astar-network-named-product-of-the-year-at-the-jba-annual-blockchain-award/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Astar Network was awarded</u></a> the Product of the Year at the 4th annual Blockchain Award by the Japan Blockchain Association.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Astar Network supports the building of dApps with EVM and WASM smart contracts and offers developers true interoperability, with cross-consensus messaging (XCM) and cross-virtual machine (XVM).&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>GALA token rose more than 68% to hit highs of $0.04022884.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Gains for GALA, the utility token of Gala Games ecosystem, came after the platform announced partnerships with Hollywood stars Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock and Mark Wahlberg.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>GALA will be the gas token users will need to collect digital tokens.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Gala (GALA), the blockchain gaming ecosystem, is seeing massive buying momentum amid broader interest in <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a> on Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The GALA token, which is the utility token on the platform, has surged a staggering 68% in the past 24 hours. As of writing, GALA was trading around $0.04022884. GALA has seen $1,241,426,652 traded in the past 24 hours too, the massive gains pushing the cryptocurrency up market ranking &ndash; GALA currently has a market cap of $288 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As well as major gains against the US dollar, the GALA price is up 58.4% against Bitcoin (BTC) to 0.00000222 BTC and 54.3% against Ether (ETH) to 0.00002904 (as at 9:00 am ET on 9 January).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Gala gains amid major Hollywood announcement</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Most cryptocurrencies, certainly all of those in top 10 by market cap are trading in the green at the time of writing. But two of the highest gainers are outside the top 50 &ndash; two great projects in Gala and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/zilliqa/">Ziliqa</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Ziliqa has gained over 50% amid new blockchain developments, GALA is seeing significant buying pressure after Gala Games <a href="https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames/status/1612299581731086337" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> its set to work with Hollywood stars Dwayne Johnson aka &lsquo;The Rock&rsquo; and Mark Wahlberg.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Apart from revealing film projects with the Hollywood A-listers, Gala Games is also moving into mobile gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, GALA is the gas token for both Gala Music and Gala Film. It means millions of fans looking to collect digital items will need gas &ndash; which in this case will be GALA.</p>
