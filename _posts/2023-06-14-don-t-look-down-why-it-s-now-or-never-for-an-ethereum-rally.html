Ethereum is finding itself in a very dangerous position, with its fate possibly in the hands of the US SEC: Is it a security, or is it a commodity? Is it decentralized enough?  While the industry figures itself out,  it is now or never for an ETHUSD rally, or there is heightened risk of a catastrophic breakdown in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  Will Carnage Across Crypto Cause Ethereum To Collapse?

Meanwhile, returning risk appetite and a pause in interest rate hikes combined with a positive ruling in the XRP case or elsewhere in the SEC drama, could save Ethereum from certain doom. #Ethereum team blue 🔵 or team red 🔴 Reply with why you picked your color ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/UTygTqQqWE — Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; (@tonythebullBTC) June 14, 2023 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.
