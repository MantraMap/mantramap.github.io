<p>Amsterdam, Netherlands, 5th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Pioneering startup The Fabricant has gone live with its boundary-pushing digital fashion storytelling project Wholeland, with a trailer that sets the scene for a provocative world that splices digital couture, mythology and the rave scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ambitious move is designed to raise the bar for the wider digital fashion industry, and lead a shift in focus away from the bear market to building Web3 experiences that create long-term, high-value engagement.</p>
<p>The OG digital fashion player is famous for its world-leading craftsmanship, gaining global prominence when it was founded as the world&rsquo;s first digital fashion house in 2018. It sold the first-ever digital garment on blockchain for 54 ETH in 2019 ($9,500 at the time). Notable collabs with physical brands such as Off-White, Adidas and World of Women contributed to it raising $14M in Series A funding in April this year.</p>
<p>Wholeland is described as a digital fashion story and a visually rich journey of self-discovery that unfolds across 7 chapters. Each chapter includes digital couture, AR wearables, co-creation, fashion shows, metaverse meet-ups and airdrops.</p>

<p class="chainwire-video-container"></p>
<p>Access to Wholeland can only be gained through minting one of The Fabricant&rsquo;s pieces of AR facewear, called XXories, that act as a key to the wider experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone can apply to Join the waitlist to mint an XXorie through The Fabricant website.</p>


<p>The WHOLELAND concept asks participants to fearlessly express all that they are through digital fashion, exploring parts of their identity that they might not share in the physical world.</p>
<p>Digital fashion fans will see the story unfold as they journey through the different chapters, with the ability to take advantage of various benefits as they progress.</p>
<p>Wholeland&rsquo;s opening chapter has multiple points of interaction for participants:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The XXories, 7 pieces of bold digital facewear that elevate virtual self-expression, and act as a key to the experience</li>
  <li>The Kappers - headpieces that mix historic Dutch style with a contemporary clubland aesthetic ready for co-creation</li>
  <li>The Looks, Couture garments that invite fearless digital fashion expression</li>
  <li>Secret Drops and groundbreaking collabs with the hottest digital artists and innovative brands</li>
  <li>And ultimately, the Wholeland metaverse - an immersive digital fashion world of highly crafted visual storytelling</li>
</ul>
<p>It all starts with the mint of the XXories in February, so sign-up to the waitlist to get access to the most innovative fashion experience in Web3.</p>
