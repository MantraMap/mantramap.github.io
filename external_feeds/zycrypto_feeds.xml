<p>Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have jointly requested additional time to disclose the Hinman documents, raising speculation about a potential settlement in their ongoing legal battle.</p>



<p>In a Friday, May 19 letter to District Judge Analisa Torres, both parties argued that the voluminous nature of the materials and the necessary redactions necessitate more time. Notably, while the original deadline had been set for June 6 2023, by the court, the parties sought a one-week extension to June 13.</p>



<p>This development follows a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">recent decision</a> by Judge Torres to deny the SEC&#8217;s motion to seal the Hinman documents earlier this week. On May 16, Judge Torres ruled that the documents were judicial and subject to a strong presumption of public access. The decision was welcomed by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who called it “another win for transparency.”</p>



<p>The documents in question are tied to a controversial 2018 speech by Bill Hinman, a former SEC director, where he stated that he did not consider Bitcoin or Ethereum as securities. Ripple has sought access to these documents, believing they support their argument that XRP should not be classified as a security.</p>



<p>The SEC had previously claimed that Hinman&#8217;s speech represented his personal views rather than the Commission&#8217;s policy, and thus the documents should be withheld from public scrutiny. However, the recent ruling by Judge Torres has brought them into the public domain. This decision marks another setback for the SEC&#8217;s attempt to seal these documents, as a judge had previously ruled against their efforts last year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-settlement-in-the-horizon"><strong>A Settlement in the Horizon?</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, following this week’s events, the possibility of public access to these documents has added fuel to the speculation about a potential settlement between Ripple and the SEC.</p>



<p><em>“Whiff of settlement talks &#8211; since this is a joint filing. The SEC does not want the Kraken released here… Still feels most like a mutually beneficial delay to work on settlement,”</em> tweeted long-term Ripple supporter Hugh Breslin.</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>My thoughts exactly</em>!” another Ripple proponent wrote, replying to Breslin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, it is important to note that the outcome of this <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">high-profile lawsuit</a> holds significant implications for the regulation of digital assets, not only in the United States but also globally. This is because it has the potential to provide clarity on the classification of cryptocurrencies and shape future regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>That said, as the Parties await a decision from Judge Torres regarding the requested extension, the Ripple adherents await eagerly as the decision may provide crucial insights into the SEC&#8217;s stance on digital assets and the future of Ripple&#8217;s XRP.</p>

<ul>
<li>A former executive of Signature Bank has made several attempts to heap blame for the bank’s failure on digital assets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>After implementing reckless management policies, Senator Cynthia Lummis criticized the position as a deflationary approach.</li>



<li>The NYDFS continues to reveal events resulting in the collapse of the bank months after taking over to “<em>protect the US economy.”&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>As investigations into Silvergate Banks ramp up, discoveries alongside the blame game from different sources come to light.</p>



<p>At a Senate Banking Committee <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/brown-holds-failed-bank-executives-accountable-mismanagement">hearing</a> on May 16, Scott Shay, a former executive of Silvergate Bank, gave his statement on the facts leading to the bank&#8217;s collapse. From his testimony, he leaned towards putting most of the blame on the bank’s readiness to deal with web3 start-ups rather than on the management team.</p>



<p>He stated that the bank started accepting deposits from digital asset firms in 2018, although the number dropped over the years due to the industry’s high volatility, especially in mid-2022. He further noted that the bank was affected by the fall of “<em>a bank with strong ties to the digital asset sector.”</em></p>



<p>The authorities asked clients to withdraw their funds leading to a massive $16 billion withdrawal from Signature Bank. After his testimony, Senators evaluated his testimony, with many lashing out at him for the complete failure of the bank.</p>



<p>Senator Cynthia Lummis knocked Shay out for trying to shift responsibility away from his team.</p>



<p>“<em>It looks like there has been a lot of deflection of blame onto those particular depositors that deal in digital assets and onto regulators, but you haven’t accepted any blame yourself,” </em>she said.</p>



<p>Despite referring to digital assets ten times during his testimony, he denied pointing fingers at web3 firms for the bank&#8217;s collapse. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-accused-of-keeping-millions">Accused of keeping millions</h2>



<p>At the hearing, Senator Elizabeth Warren further <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/at-hearing-warren-blasts-former-svb-and-signature-bank-ceos-for-keeping-millions-after-recklessly-crashing-banks">criticized</a> Shay and Silicon Valley’s CEO Gregory Pecker who are accused of “<em>keeping millions after recklessly crashing banks.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Right now, the law says that people like Mr. Becker and Mr. Shay can pay themselves tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and stock options, and when the banks blow up, Mr. Becker and Mr. Shay get to keep all the money. And that is just plain wrong. If we don&#8217;t fix it, every CEO for these multibillion-dollar banks will keep right on loading up on risks and blowing up banks, and everybody else is going to have to pay for it.”</em></p>



<p>Senator Warren also noted that she will work on a bill to curtail the powers of bank executives to receive these “<em>crazy paychecks.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Recall that in April, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said it would be wrong to blame virtual assets for the bank’s collapse but rather on “a <em>new-fashioned bank run.”</em></p>

<p>Since last week, the Bitcoin network has remained congested with more than 420,000 unconfirmed transactions, raising suspicions of a possible malicious attack.</p>



<p>According to several developers and cryptocurrency community enthusiasts, the Bitcoin network is<a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-surging-transaction-fees-viewed-as-direct-attack-by-a-cross-section-of-the-community/"> being attacked</a> by persons who are willing to lose millions of dollars to render the network unusable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-community-expresses-concern"><strong>Bitcoin community expresses concern</strong></h2>



<p>Developer iris.to/jogi (@proofofjogi) stated over the weekend that Bitcoin is under a DoS attack, one of the many tools hackers use to overwhelm a website by flooding the network with access requests.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Bitcoin is under DoS attack. High transaction fees are the chosen pain point by the attacker, probably to make Bitcoin unusable for smaller players.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>In addition, he explained that this could have been planned for several months, as network congestion has been increasing since the implementation of the Ordinals protocol, which allows the issuance of NFT tokens on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From ordinals to DoS attack didn&#39;t take that much time. 3ish months, give or take couple days.<br><br>We&#39;re in the then-they-fight-you-stage</p>&mdash; iris.to/jogi (@proofofjogi) <a href="https://twitter.com/proofofjogi/status/1655157040753385472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, user Chad Pleb pointed out that the Bitcoin network&#8217;s congestion is maliciously caused by hackers or groups willing to spend up to $9 million in losses from the minting of Ordinals tokens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If these stats are correct, that&#39;s ~300 BTC(~$9M in USD) for &quot;transacting&quot; json and links to jpegs? JFC <a href="https://t.co/JToc9zErzw">pic.twitter.com/JToc9zErzw</a></p>&mdash; Chad Pleb (@chad_pleb) <a href="https://twitter.com/chad_pleb/status/1654948345364766725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This argument was supported by Francis Pouliot, CEO and co-founder of Bull Bitcoin, who showed an image of a conversation in which a person indicated that anyone with a large amount of money could make the Bitcoin network unusable by increasing transaction costs through excessive minting of Ordinals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Average Bitcoin transaction costs rise to 2021 levels</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the fact that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-price-outlook-uncertain-as-key-support-level-faces-crucial-test/">BTC price</a> is far from the bullish rally it experienced during 2021, where transaction costs reached an all-time high of $70, the actual cost for verifying transactions has remained relatively high, ranging between $8 and $20.</p>



<p>Although some analysts indicate that this is a momentary issue as average fees have been decreasing, network congestion is not improving, according to Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain explorer and mempool, Mempool Space.</p>



<p>At the time of writing this note, there are more than 300,000 pending transactions, with an average cost of medium priority of approximately $7. This proves that the latest Bitcoin update sacrificed network stability for unnecessary innovation.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, is facing a challenging outlook as selling pressure from miners increases.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency’s price has been consolidating in a tight, sideways pattern in the past week after facing a significant pullback in early May. On several occasions this week, the price attempted to push and stay above $27,000 but failed towards the weekend, with various fundamentals suggesting the cryptocurrency could face a further drop.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81144" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miners-sell-their-coins"><strong>Miners Sell their coins</strong></h2>



<p>Apart from dwindling trading volumes, potentially reflecting investors&#8217; lack of interest in a low-volatility market, there are indications that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-miners-are-feeling-the-pinch-of-high-energy-prices-and-slump-in-crypto-prices/">Bitcoin miners</a> may have played a role in the recent decline in price.</p>



<p>Earlier today, onchain analytics firm CryptoQuant took to Twitter to share these observations, stating that there is a high probability that 1,750 BTC has ultimately made its way to Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges. CryptoQuant&#8217;s assertions came after a thorough examination of various wallets linked to Bitcoin miners by “IT Tech”, an author and analyst at the firm, who tracked the movement of the coins to the exchange.</p>



<p><em>“There is a high probability that 1750 BTC ultimately went to Binance. Miners&#8217; reserves are decreasing, indicating a selling pressure from the miners&#8217; side,</em>” wrote IT Tech.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="645" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19-1024x645.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81143" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19-1024x645.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19-768x484.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Notably, amid declining prices, Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate has also experienced a minor decline in recent days. This decrease indicates a migration of miners away from the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of the current writing, Bitcoin Network Hash Rate was 344.77M, down from 440M on May 2.</p>



<p>These developments raise concerns among market participants, which explains the stagnation of Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been experiencing volatility in recent weeks, with several factors, including regulatory inflation concerns impacting its trajectory. The increasing selling pressure from miners, combined with whale transactions, thus adds another layer of complexity to the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Miners’ Sales to Subside Soon</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, despite these developments, CryptoQuant’s analyst “BaroVirtual” notes that the unloading of bags may <a href="https://zycrypto.com/are-fears-of-bitcoin-miners-selling-pressure-overblown-this-expert-thinks-so/">slow down</a> soon. </p>



<p><em>“From May 5, 2023, Bitcoin miners began to reduce their Bitcoin holdings drastically, and on May 9, 2023, the miner&#8217;s net position moved into negative territory, indicating intense pressure from miners. Currently, the miner net position values are in the zone where Bitcoin bounced off in previous times, and the local uptrend continued,”</em> the pundit recently wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to him, miners could significantly slow down sales when Bitcoin hits the $24,000 target.</p>



<p>Bitcoin traded at $26,853 at press time, down 1.14% in the past 24 hours. In the past week, the price has only managed to gain by 1.73%, as per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Renowned Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser insists that all cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, should be classified as securities.</p>



<p>In a recent tweet, Max Keiser, an advisor to the El Salvadorian government on Bitcoin, boldly proclaimed that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">XRP</a> and all other cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities except for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Keiser&#8217;s tweet was in response to recent statements by Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, regarding the regulatory classification of digital assets. During a question-and-answer session at the 27th annual Financial Markets Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on May 15, Gensler referred to crypto markets as “generally non-compliant”, adding that they were based on the “false narrative of decentralization”.</p>



<p>In response to Gensler’s statement, Keiser tweeted on May 16; &#8211;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Gary&#8217;s right. Everything not Bitcoin, is a security (including ETH &amp; XRP). We already put this into law in El Salvador. We&#8217;re Bitcoin Country and we&#8217;re thriving. I invite Gary Gensler to El Salvador to come and see how we became the leading BTC country in the world.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>But Keiser&#8217;s criticism of XRP did not end there. On Wednesday, May 17, the self-proclaimed Bitcoin maximalist continued his tirade, labelling Ripple as &#8220;crooks&#8221; and supporting the SEC&#8217;s decision to shut them down.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Ripple are crooks. Their business model is selling unregistered securities. The SEC is right to shut them down,&#8221;</em> Keiser stated, commenting on an article highlighting Ripple’s $250 million acquisition of Swiss custody firm Metaco.</p>



<p>Keiser&#8217;s recent rants have triggered intense discussions within the cryptocurrency community, with some members of the XRP community engaging the Bitcoiner in heated conversations. One notable XRP enthusiast, Mr Huber, referred to Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; recent ruling. Recently, the judge ordered the sealing of documents related to Ripple&#8217;s XRP sales to On-Demand Liquidity clients, citing the need to protect sensitive information concerning Ripple&#8217;s primary business line.</p>



<p><em>“A judge calling to protect Ripple&#8217;s sales of XRP because it&#8217;s their main line of business also doesn&#8217;t sound the slightest like a judge who is going to shut it down,” </em>Huber wrote in a Thursday, May 18 tweet tagging Keiser.</p>



<p>That said, the assertions by Keiser, who has long been an ardent supporter of Bitcoin, highlight a growing debate on the regulatory status of various cryptocurrencies. Keiser implies that these digital assets should be subjected to stricter regulations to safeguard investors&#8217; interests by categorising cryptocurrencies as securities. On various occasions, chair Gensler reiterated that all cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin are securities and should be regulated under existing laws.</p>



<p>That said, amidst the ongoing debate surrounding cryptocurrency regulation, industry participants, investors, and regulators eagerly anticipate <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-blames-confusing-u-s-crypto-rules-for-flow-of-investment-to-europe-and-asia/">clearer guidelines</a> from the SEC or lawmakers. It will also be interesting to see what the court finally decides in the ongoing SEC vs Ripple Lawsuit with judgement day drawing near.</p>

<p>Despite a recent lacklustre performance, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/3-catalysts-renewing-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-price-as-meme-coins-see-sudden-resurgence/">Shiba Inu</a>, the cryptocurrency that gained popularity in late 2021, still has a dedicated community of supporters who remain optimistic about its future trajectory and price breakout to the highly-coveted $0.001 price. While there are concerns about its high supply and lack of utility, the Shiba Inu team is actively working on initiatives to address these issues, such as developing Shibarium, an upcoming layer-2 (L2) blockchain network.</p>



<p>2022 saw favourable conditions for the 2nd most popular meme coin as growing adoption and integration continued. More exchanges and merchants began to accept Shiba Inu as a form of payment. In addition, burn events and supply reduction permanently reduced some of Shiba Inu&#8217;s supply from circulation. If this continues, it could help reduce the supply and increase the value of the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu has one of the most loyal communities in Crypto, and the launch of Shiboshis, Shiba Inu&#8217;s own NFT project, and other NFT projects built on the Shiba Inu network could add utility and value to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. However, according to a recent interview in the international business times, the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain project is still in development, according to Project Leader Shytoshi Kusama.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/shibarium-the-project-set-to-propel-shiba-inu-beyond-predictions-of-a-0-001-shib-price/">Shibarium</a> is currently in beta test mode, and as Kusama had previously stated numerous times, all tokens on the testnet Puppynet are not real and are merely for testing. However, he once more cautioned the Shiba Inu community about this, noting that thus far, no actual tokens have been singed.</p>



<p>On the other hand, some general factors may influence the price of SHIB. First, the state of the market as a whole is probably going to have an impact on Shiba Inu&#8217;s price. For example, Shiba Inu&#8217;s price is more likely to increase if the cryptocurrency market, in general, is bullish. On the other hand, Shiba Inu&#8217;s price is more likely to diminish if the market is bearish.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu prices can also be impacted by news and events. For instance, the price will likely increase if there is good news regarding Shiba Inu, such as a new alliance or a significant advancement. In contrast, the price will probably decrease if there is bad news, like a security breach or scandal.</p>



<p>As with all meme coins, there is, of course, speculation. Shiba Inu buyers engage in speculation when they purchase SHIB in anticipation of a price increase. Speculation can cause prices to rise quickly, but it can also cause prices to fall quickly.</p>



<p>As with all meme coins, investors should proceed cautiously and only invest what they can afford to lose.</p>

<p>According to a May 8, 2023 press release, the Bank of Canada has launched online public consultations to understand the features that could be included in a digital Canadian dollar.</p>



<p>The consultation seeks to understand how Canadians would likely use a Canadian digital dollar, what security features are important, and accessibility and privacy concerns. The public consultation runs until June 19, 2023.</p>



<p>The Bank of Canada has stated that a digital Canadian dollar is not needed at this time, and any decision to issue one rests with Parliament and the Government of Canada.</p>



<p>In November 2022, the Canadian government launched a consultation on digital currencies, including stablecoins and central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Bank of Canada continues to actively research, prepare and consult on the case of a potential CBDC. The Bank of Canada will publish a report summarizing this consultation later this year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Philip Lowe, said that the RBA had issued a small amount of digital currency to explore possible use cases of new forms of digital money, including a CBDC, as part of a research project with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowe made these remarks at the Reserve Bank Board Dinner in Perth on May 2, 2023. Lowe further said that the RBA was very interested in this project&#8217;s results.</p>



<p>In an August 2022 joint media release, the RBA and the DFCRC announced a collaboration on a research project to explore use cases for a CBDC in Australia. The report on the project’s findings is expected in mid-2023.</p>



<p>According to the PwC Global Crypto Regulation Report 2023, Australia does not have a bespoke regulatory framework for digital assets unless the assets are caught through existing rules which apply to financial products and general consumer law.</p>



<p>In December 2021, the Australian Government agreed to establish regulatory regimes for digital assets, including a licensing and custody regime, decentralized autonomous organizations structures, reviewing the policy framework for digital assets taxation, token mapping and research on potential CBDC viability.</p>



<p>In May 2022, the Australian Government undertook to consult on custody obligations for third-party custodians of crypto assets and provide additional consumer safeguards. In September 2022, a draft bill, the Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill, was published for parliamentary debate and public consultation on digital assets, including stablecoins.</p>



<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) continues to support the development of a regulatory framework with a focus on consumer protection and market integrity.</p>

<p>Regulations play a critical role in reshaping the global cryptocurrency business, which is undergoing considerable changes. In a recent CNBC interview, Ripple CEO <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-tells-where-crypto-market-is-headed-as-xrp-lawsuit-heads-for-conclusion/">Brad Garlinghouse</a> underlined the regulatory uncertainty that U.S. cryptocurrency companies must deal with.</p>



<p>He voiced concerns that this unpredictability is suppressing innovation and driving businesses to look for more benevolent countries.</p>



<p>In the interview, he said, <em>&#8220;Frankly, it&#8217;s why you&#8217;re seeing entrepreneurship and investment flowing into other jurisdictions — and certainly, Europe has been a significant beneficiary of the confusion that has existed in the U.S.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Garlinghouse&#8217;s worries are shared by several industry players who contend that regulatory clarity is crucial for promoting innovation, luring investment, and guaranteeing consumer protection. Yet, while other nations have proactively worked to provide a supportive regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, the United States has come under fire for moving too slowly in this direction.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse indicated that more cryptocurrency businesses might think about moving or expanding their operations abroad due to the regulatory uncertainties in the United States. This pattern may slow the development of the U.S. cryptocurrency market and result in a talent and capital outflow.</p>



<p>In a tweet, the CEO said: <em>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s fair to say the U.S. has made it as confusing as possible as to what the rules of the road are for the crypto industry. The SEC has really been at the forefront of that confusion.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Due to their transparent and thorough regulatory frameworks, nations like Switzerland, Singapore, and Malta have become popular destinations for cryptocurrency businesses. These governments have taken proactive steps to create regulations that strike a balance between consumer protection and innovation, creating a more stable environment for the growth of crypto firms.</p>



<p>According to Garlinghouse, the regulatory uncertainty experienced by U.S. cryptocurrency companies creates serious obstacles to the growth and competitiveness of the sector. The United States runs the risk of losing its status as a major center for the cryptocurrency industry as more businesses look for chances abroad.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple is investing more money elsewhere because of the regulatory uncertainties present in the United States. He stressed that the vast majority of Ripple&#8217;s clientele—roughly 95%—is situated outside of the United States. Additionally, he stated that overseas locations would be the primary focus of Ripple&#8217;s employment efforts in the upcoming year.</p>



<p>The CEO of Ripple also spoke on the business&#8217;s financial situation, noting that it is now in a good place. This comes after Ripple&#8217;s most recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">acquisition of Metaco</a>, a Swiss company specializing in cryptocurrency custody services. Garlinghouse disclosed that $250 million in cash from Ripple&#8217;s balance sheet was used to pay for Metaco.</p>

<p>Turkey has seen a huge increase in cryptocurrency ownership as the country&#8217;s inflation rates skyrocket, according to GWI Research. With a 27.1% increase in ownership from July-September 2021 to July-September 2022, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-to-donate-1-million-in-xrp-to-earthquake-victims-in-turkey-and-syria/">Turkey</a> had the biggest growth in cryptocurrency ownership, according to the survey, which looked at people between the ages of 16 and 64. Argentina and the Philippines were close behind, with increases of 23.5% and 23.4% in crypto ownership rates.</p>



<p>The soaring inflation rates in these nations can be blamed for the rise in crypto possession. The Turkish Lira had a sharp collapse in late 2021, losing 44% of its value in relation to the US dollar. Early in 2022, the country&#8217;s inflation rate exceeded 30%; by the end of the year, it was a startling 72.31%. The daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies in Turkey reached an average of $1.8 billion due to these economic considerations.</p>



<p>The use of cryptocurrencies in these nations has broad ramifications. Over 2.4 million Turks, or about 2.94% of the population, are now considered Bitcoin owners. The devaluation of the Turkish Lira, which impacted many Turkish families&#8217; savings and investments, has improved the environment for the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the Turkish populace has come to favour cryptocurrencies due to their simplicity of use and perception of them as a hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>Trading is the only available alternative for people interested in the field due to Turkey&#8217;s lack of a regulatory framework, which has allowed cryptocurrency trading to grow. However, as the government prepares to introduce its central bank&#8217;s digital currency, the digital lira, in 2023, regulatory adjustments are anticipated in the upcoming years. Higher taxes and more precise regulations for cryptocurrency-related activity are predicted, yet a total ban on cryptocurrencies seems unlikely.</p>



<p>A loss of faith in fiat money and demand for alternative stores of value in Argentina and the Philippines has also sparked the popularity of cryptocurrencies. The public&#8217;s increased interest in cryptocurrencies is a sign that digital assets are becoming more widely accepted and that decentralised financial systems are becoming more prevalent.</p>



<p>Significant trading volumes are seen on major Turkish cryptocurrency exchanges like BtcTurk and Paribu, indicating that the rise in cryptocurrency ownership in these nations is not going unnoticed. Another sign of cryptocurrencies&#8217; expanding societal influence is their growth into other industries, like sports sponsorship and university courses.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies have become popular for people looking to secure their wealth as the global economy struggles with the pandemic&#8217;s aftermath and inflationary pressures. The rise in cryptocurrency ownership in Turkey, Argentina, and the Philippines demonstrates the growing acceptance and acknowledgement of cryptocurrencies as an alternative financial tool in times of economic upheaval, even though difficulties and concerns still exist.</p>

<p>San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">Ripple</a> has introduced a platform for governments, central banks, and financial institutions to create their own digital currency. Described as “a frictionless end-to-end solution”, the new platform is based on Ripple&#8217;s XRP Ledger and is an improved version of Ripple&#8217;s Private Ledger.</p>



<p>Ripple has also joined forces with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which acts as the defacto central bank, for the launch of the digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) pilot program.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-point-of-ripple-s-new-cbdc-platform"><strong>What Is The Point Of Ripple’s New CBDC Platform?</strong></h2>



<p>CBDCs are a hot topic right now. Unlike crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, CBDCs are controlled and managed by a centralized entity. Per the Atlantic Council’s tracker, only 11 nations have rolled out a central bank digital currency so far, but many other countries are researching and testing the technology.</p>



<p>Ripple has waded further into the CBDC game via the launch of a new platform for creating blockchain-based digital currencies. The Ripple platform allows for the oversight and customization of the entire life cycle of the CBDC, including minting, distribution, redemption, and removal from circulation. The CBDC platform will also let institutions operate and conduct inter-institutional settlement and distribution functions.</p>



<p>Ripple will leverage the power of blockchain technology used for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/automated-market-makers-finally-coming-to-xrpl-why-this-feature-could-be-super-bullish-for-1-xrp-price/">XRP Ledger</a> and provide a way for government institutions to increase financial inclusion and reduce the risk involved in domestic and cross-border payments.</p>



<p>President of the Republic of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, hailed Ripple’s new CBDC platform while describing how it’s enabling them to create their own solutions.</p>



<p>“<em>Partnering with Ripple to help create our national digital currency is part of our commitment to lead in financial innovation and technologies, which will provide the citizens of Palau with greater financial access”.</em></p>



<p>It will be possible for financial institutions to use the platform to oversee the distribution processes involving their digital currency, while end users — both corporate and retail — will be able to hold their CBDC securely and use them to pay and receive payment for goods and services, similar to how banking apps function today. This entails the convenience of offline transactions and as well as accommodating non-smartphone cases.</p>



<p>Ripple is also collaborating with Taiwan’s Fubon Bank to develop a real estate asset tokenization and equity release product using a retail version of the e-HKD CBDC.</p>

<p>Aisha Ghaus Pasha, the minister of state for finance and revenue, declared that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-adoption-gets-major-boost-after-first-in-market-remittance-corridor-between-uae-and-pakistan-opens/">Pakistan</a> would outlaw cryptocurrency services operating in the country and reaffirmed that the government has no plans to legalize cryptocurrency trading during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue on May 16. </p>



<p>This attitude has been featured in numerous local media stories, and other officials, such as the Director of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Sohail Jawad, have supported the choice. This article examines Pakistan&#8217;s stance on cryptocurrencies and their effects on the local cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The declaration by Minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha underscores Pakistan&#8217;s steadfast opposition to cryptocurrencies and its choice to outlaw their use. The government is most worried about potential cryptocurrency threats, like money laundering, financing of terrorism, and illegal activity. Pakistan wants to reduce these risks and safeguard its financial system and populace by enacting a ban.</p>



<p>Pakistan&#8217;s move to outlaw cryptocurrency services is motivated by a number of issues. First of all, the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies creates difficulties for governmental supervision and raises questions about possible abuse. Additionally, investors face risks due to the volatility and speculative character of cryptocurrencies, which may result in financial instability. The government claims to protect its citizens from these dangers by limiting access to crypto services.</p>



<p>The prohibition on cryptocurrency services has also received the approval of the State Bank of Pakistan, the nation&#8217;s national bank. Among other officials, SBP Director Sohail Jawad has emphasized the necessity of preserving the stability of Pakistan&#8217;s financial system and the possible dangers posed by cryptocurrencies. The government&#8217;s decision to outlaw crypto services in the nation was further supported by the SBP&#8217;s support of that position.</p>



<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), despite not having the authority to impose sanctions on non-compliant nations, has a considerable impact on corporate and governmental policy globally. Pakistan, which is undergoing an economic crisis and negotiating a bailout with the International Monetary Fund, may prioritise receiving a positive FATF evaluation. Both the FATF and the IMF have raised concerns over crypto numerous times.</p>



<p>Pakistan has experienced significant cryptocurrency adoption despite the government&#8217;s objections, with its residents reportedly having $20 billion worth of cryptocurrencies in 2021. Since at least January, the State Bank of Pakistan has been pushing for a cryptocurrency ban. However, Pakistan recently established a national blockchain &#8216;Know Your Customer&#8217; infrastructure and aims to introduce a central bank digital currency in 2025.</p>

<p>Despite still being fairly new, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the art and digital collectables market by storm. However, according to a recent finding, it appears that Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto anticipated this trend long before NFTs became a household name.</p>



<p>The revelation came to light when Udi Wertheimer, a prominent figure in the crypto community, made an intriguing discovery in a post on the original Bitcointalk forum. On May 14, Wertheimer tweeted about finding evidence of the first-ever real-world Bitcoin payment made in 2010 to purchase an NFT.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25.0">post</a> in question was made by a pseudonymous user named &#8220;Sabunir&#8221; on the Bitcointalk forum on January 24, 2010. Sabunir announced plans to sell a JPEG image for $1 worth of Bitcoin, which amounted to a staggering 500 BTC at the time. He then posted his address, telling any interested buyer to send him a private message.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Satoshi Nakamoto responded to the post, giving recommendations on how the seller would execute the sale using Bitcoin. Satoshi suggested sending BTC to a merchant&#8217;s static IP address with a comment or creating a new BTC address for the transaction. He even mentioned that this method could become the “standard way” for website software to handle such transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="248" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-18-1024x248.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81100" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-18-1024x248.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-18-300x73.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-18-768x186.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-18-1536x372.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-18.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And while the discussion lacks conclusive evidence of a sale, ZyCrypto conducted an inquiry into the address and discovered a <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1BHtsCnpmTvpgJEP7eMKEVhpJFunxSM8vq">transaction</a> of 500 Bitcoin on 02/24/2010. This means that if this transaction is indeed connected to the image&#8217;s sale, it will precede the well-known first Bitcoin transaction of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-reclaims-30000-as-crypto-community-celebrates-12th-anniversary-of-bitcoin-pizza-day/">10,000 for 2 pizzas</a>, which took place on 05/22/2010.</p>



<p>However, the claim of the NFT sale has been disputed by various observers, with Wertheimer suggesting that the JPEG sale was never executed, despite 500 BTC being sent to that address a month after the sale offer was made.</p>



<p><em>“It is possible that the 500 BTC were sent as a donation for a different interaction and that the JPEG sale was never executed. Only one way to know for sure… maybe one day Sabunir comes back and tells us what really happened,” </em>Wertheimer tweeted on Sunday, May 14.</p>



<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding the specific transaction, some believe that Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s assistance and guidance in executing the potential sale implies his support for the concept of NFTs.</p>



<p><em>“The most notable thing of all is that Satoshi treated this all like it was the most normal thing in the world. He&#8217;d have absolutely been pro-ordinals,”</em> Mike McDonald <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMcDonald89/status/1657862722317369344">tweeted</a>, responding to Wertheimer’s post.</p>



<p>Notably, Satoshi’s actions align with the actions of early Bitcoin developer <a href="https://zycrypto.com/remembering-the-life-of-hal-finney-early-bitcoin-user-who-received-the-first-bitcoin-transaction-from-satoshi-nakamoto/">Hal Finney</a>, who <a href="https://twitter.com/bullishbyte/status/1657882459567009792">received</a> the first Bitcoin transaction from Satoshi and expressed interest in &#8220;Crypto trading cards&#8221; in a 1993 email.</p>

<p>The SEC vs Ripple case has taken yet <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sees-new-twists-and-turns-as-ripples-counsel-exposes-secs-slippery-slope-in-crypto-regulation/">another intriguing turn</a>, as Ripple&#8217;s legal officer Stuart Alderoty reveals new findings that go against the SEC&#8217;s arguments. Alderoty took to Twitter to make the statement, sharing his perspective on the SEC&#8217;s position and highlighting a past case that serves as a precedent for the Ripple lawsuit.</p>



<p>In his tweet, Alderoty referenced a 1946 Supreme Court case known as &#8220;Howey”, where the SEC unsuccessfully argued that an investment in a &#8220;common enterprise&#8221; was unnecessary if there was a &#8220;community of interest.&#8221; Alderoty argued that the SEC was wrong then and is still wrong now, stating that &#8220;Common Interest ≠ Common Enterprise.&#8221; This statement suggests that Ripple&#8217;s case is grounded in legal precedent, giving them a solid foundation to challenge the SEC&#8217;s claims.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-vs-sec-what-s-been-going-on"><strong>Ripple vs SEC: What’s Been Going On?</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple, a blockchain-based payment protocol, has been embroiled in a lawsuit with the SEC since December 2020 over allegations of selling unregistered securities. The Ripple lawsuit has been a topic of interest for many in the crypto world, as it has significant implications for the industry. The SEC alleges that Ripple and its executives engaged in selling unregistered securities, a violation of US securities laws.</p>



<p>Ripple has maintained its innocence in the case and has been fighting to have the lawsuit dismissed. The company claims that XRP, its native cryptocurrency, is not a security and, therefore, not subject to SEC regulation. Ripple has also accused the SEC of causing &#8220;multi-billion dollar losses to innocent third parties&#8221; through its actions against the company.</p>



<p>The case has been ongoing for over a year, with both parties presenting their arguments in court. However, Alderoty&#8217;s tweet suggests that Ripple&#8217;s legal team isn&#8217;t backing down and is continuing to build its case against the SEC. The reference to the &#8220;Howey&#8221; case is significant because it established the legal test for determining whether an asset is a security. If Ripple can show that XRP does not meet the &#8220;Howey&#8221; test, then it could be a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/what-a-ripple-sec-possible-settlement-could-mean-for-xrp-as-game-changing-ruling-nears/">game-changer</a> for the entire cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>The case has seen several developments in recent months, including a ruling by the court allowing Ripple to depose former SEC official William Hinman, who allegedly made comments indicating that XRP was not a security. The SEC has fought against Hinman&#8217;s deposition, arguing that it would be &#8220;unreasonable and oppressive.&#8221;</p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s motion to seal the controversial William Hinman Ethereum speech docs has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">just been rejected</a> by Judge Analisa Torres — a move hailed by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse as a remarkable step toward transparency.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple has been controversial, with many in the crypto community criticizing the agency for its handling of the matter. Some have accused the SEC of attempting to regulate the crypto industry through litigation rather than through the proper channels of rule-making and legislation.</p>



<p>Despite the twists and turns of the case, it is clear that both Ripple and the SEC are taking the matter seriously. The lawsuit&#8217;s outcome will have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry, and it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess which way it will go. However, with Stuart Alderoty and the rest of Ripple&#8217;s legal team continuing to build their case, it seems likely that the case will continue to make headlines for some time.</p>

<p>Tether, the firm behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has revealed plans to allocate 15% of its net monthly profits towards purchasing Bitcoin.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, May 17, the company stated that it would henceforth “focus exclusively” on investing in Bitcoin with actual profits from its business operations only, without regard to unrealized capital gains generated by price increases. This means that Tether will focus on the actual gains it has achieved, which is the difference between the purchase price and the amount received from selling an investment.</p>



<p><em>“Starting this month, Tether will regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin. These Bitcoin shall be considered on top of the minimum reserve’s assets that 100% back tether tokens.”</em> The firm <a href="https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1658805845340180480">tweeted</a> Wednesday, May 17.</p>



<p>In a separate note, Paolo Ardoino, Tether&#8217;s chief technology officer, elaborated on Tether&#8217;s choice of Bitcoin, stating, &#8220;<em>Bitcoin is the epitome of a sound and secure monetary system with its decentralized nature and scarcity.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Recognizing Bitcoin&#8217;s revolutionary potential, he further acknowledged its ability to challenge traditional finance and redefine the concept of money, adding that the cryptocurrency has “<em>defied expectations, shattered boundaries, and provides access to the global financial system to anyone with an internet connection.”</em></p>

<p>According to the statement, Tether currently holds over $2.5 Billion worth of assets in company-owned “excess reserves&#8221;. It’s important to note that these excess reserves represent additional funds beyond the 100% reserves required to back Tether&#8217;s stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The accumulation of these reserves is a result of interest earned from a vast portfolio of investments, including US Treasury bills and other assets like gold. Tether’s strategy to keep excess reserves in its portfolio is driven by its need to keep its stablecoin products as resilient as possible.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s total Bitcoin holdings amount to approximately $1.5 billion, representing approximately 1.8% of its total reserves, which sat around <a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-latest-q1-2023-assurance-report-shows-reserves-surplus-at-all-time-high-of-244b-up-148b-in-net-profit-new-categories-for-additional-transparency-reveals-bitcoin-and-gold-allocations/">$81.8 billion</a> at the close of the first quarter. On the other hand, about 4% or $3.2 billion of those reserves are in gold.</p>



<p>That said, Tether&#8217;s decision to invest 15% of its monthly profits in Bitcoin demonstrates its growing confidence in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s benefits, including its ability to serve as a hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>This decision also coincides with the company&#8217;s efforts to significantly reduce its reliance on bank deposits and mitigate counterparty risks associated with recent bank failures in the US. Last quarter, Tether successfully reduced its bank deposits from $5.3 billion to $4.31 million.</p>
