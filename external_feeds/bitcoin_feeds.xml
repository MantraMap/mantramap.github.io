<h2>CCTV&#8217;s Coverage of Hong Kong&#8217;s Crypto Regulations Sparks Excitement, Says Binance CEO; Nanxin University Launches Metaverse Platform</h2>
<p>This week CZ emphasized that the coverage of cryptocurrencies by CCTV is significant, especially considering that crypto asset businesses were prohibited in China in September 2021. The Binance boss <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1661391542504902664?s=20">stated</a>: &#8220;CCTV (China Central Television) just broadcasted crypto — It&#8217;s a big deal — The Chinese speaking communities are buzzing. Historically, coverages like these led to bull runs.” He also noted that he wasn&#8217;t suggesting the &#8220;past predicts the future&#8221; and his statement was &#8220;not financial advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The specific CCTV segment CZ referred to centers on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kong-launches-digital-currency-pilot-with-16-firms-including-hsbc-bank-of-china-alipay/">Hong Kong</a>&#8216;s regulatory <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/api/consultation/conclusion?lang=EN&amp;refNo=23CP1">approach</a> for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). These entities must comply with the regulations by June 1, 2023, and the rules do not reflect a &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kong-to-have-tight-crypto-regulations-head-of-monetary-authority-says/">light-touch regulation</a>&#8221; philosophy. Following CZ&#8217;s comment, one Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/dashutiaozi/status/1661392019418419207?s=20">observed</a>: &#8220;It is not necessarily a bull market when there are Chinese people involved, but it is definitely not a bull market when there are no Chinese people involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>CZ <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1661392242341183489?s=20">admitted</a> he could not dispute this observation. In addition to the CCTV report, Nanxin University <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9RERVM48GJuz8V13HhzaKQ">established</a> the China Metaverse Technology and Application Innovation Platform just two days prior. The university&#8217;s president Li Beiqun expressed enthusiasm about metaverse development, asserting that the metaverse platform would promote progress in metaverse-related fields.</p>

<p>During the event, metaverse platform creators unveiled an augmented reality (AR) map of their platform. It was also mentioned that the China Metaverse Technology and Application Innovation Platform is part of the government-supported China Industry-University-Research Cooperation Promotion Association initiative. However, following last year&#8217;s metaverse hype wave, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-reportedly-axing-metaverse-division-amidst-company-restructuring/">interest in the concept</a> has been overshadowed by attention toward <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/artificial-intelligence-and-cryptocurrency-the-rise-of-ai-focused-projects-in-2023/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) software such as Openai&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chatgpt-pretty-intelligent-did-not-recommend-bitcoin-peter-schiff-tweets/">chatgpt</a>.</p>

The new rules were adopted to align the country’s legal framework for cryptocurrencies with global standards in the field.</strong></p>
<h2>Japan to Enforce Legislation Allowing the Tracing of Crypto Transactions</h2>
<p>The Cabinet of Japan, the executive power in Tokyo, has decided to enforce more stringent AML rules for cryptocurrency operations from June 1, the Kyodo News agency reported. The measures will bring the nation’s regulatory framework in line with international standards and allow the government to trace digital-asset transactions.</p>
<p>Japanese lawmakers amended the respective laws in December 2022, in response to recommendations by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental organization developing policies designed to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.</p>
<p>The FATF had evaluated Japan’s previous AML procedures as insufficient. Besides the legislative revisions, the country’s oversight bodies have been strengthening their monitoring of crypto assets that can potentially be used to launder illicit funds.</p>

<p>One of the mechanisms that should allow authorities in Japan to better track the movement of digital money is the so-called ‘<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel rule</a>.’ It requires service providers to identify both the sender and receiver of a crypto transfer, with this information “traveling” with each transaction.</p>
<p>Besides cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the updated regulations also cover stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or various commodities, the report notes. Entities failing to comply with corrective orders issued by Japanese regulators will face criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>The news from Tokyo comes after the recent summit in Hiroshima of the Group of Seven (G7) developed economies, of which Japan is a member. In an article published ahead of the meeting, the FATF President T. Raja Kumar <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fatf-president-urges-g7-to-lead-in-shutting-down-lawless-crypto-space/">urged</a> the G7 nations to bring an “end to the lawless crypto space.” Citing FATF requirements, Pakistan recently announced its intentions to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pakistan-to-ban-online-services-related-to-cryptocurrencies/">ban</a> online crypto services.</p>

In addition to the officials from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, Russia&#8217;s central bank governor and officials from Belarus and Afghanistan also attended the meeting.</strong></p>
<h2>&#8216;De-Dollarization Is Not a Voluntary Choice by Countries’</h2>
<p>The two-day 51st annual Asian Clearing Union (ACU) meeting began on Tuesday in Tehran, with participation from officials representing members of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) as well as several others. The meeting was hosted by the central bank of Iran and de-dollarization was a key topic discussed at the event, Tasnim news service reported.</p>
<p>The ACU currently has nine members: Bangladesh Bank, Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan, Reserve Bank of India, Central Bank of Iran, Maldives Monetary Authority, Central Bank of Myanmar, Nepal Rastra Bank, State Bank of Pakistan, and Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Apart from the top officials of the ACU members, the governor of the Russian central bank is attending as an observer along with officials from Belarus and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Commenting on the role of the U.S. dollar in the world economy and a growing number of countries shifting away from using the USD in trade settlement, Iran&#8217;s First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber said at the meeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>De-dollarization is not a voluntary choice by countries anymore, it is the countries&#8217; inevitable response to the ‘weaponization project of the dollar.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Mokhber noted that over the past few decades, the &#8220;Weaponization of the dollar&#8221; has compelled countries to distance themselves from reliance on the USD in order to mitigate the potential impact of possible future sanctions.</p>
<p>Addressing the growing trend of countries seeking to diminish their reliance on the U.S. dollar, the Iranian first vice president pointed out that the weakening of the dollar poses a significant challenge to the United States&#8217; global influence. Concluding his remarks, he emphasized that the Islamic Republic is ready to enhance its banking and trade relations with other nations, particularly ACU member states.</p>

<p>Iran has been ramping up its de-dollarization efforts, such as phasing out the USD in bilateral <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-and-iran-phasing-out-us-dollar-in-bilateral-trade-settlements/">trade agreements with Russia</a>. Earlier this month, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called on the central bank of Iran to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/president-raisi-calls-central-bank-of-iran-to-ditch-u-s-dollar-shift-to-national-currencies/">ditch the U.S. dollar</a> in trade and use national currencies instead. President Raisi also said Iran is seeking to join the BRICS economic bloc to counter Western hegemony and promote a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-seeks-brics-membership-to-counter-western-hegemony-promote-multipolar-world-says-president-raisi/">multipolar world</a>.</p>
<p>The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have also pushed to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. The economic group is discussing creating a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a> that is set to be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discussed</a> at its upcoming leaders&#8217; summit. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">Ten Southeast Asian countries</a>, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), also recently agreed to encourage the use of national currencies instead of the U.S. dollar.</p>

The two nations reportedly want to &#8220;develop and establish a bigger regional market&#8221; while ensuring &#8220;a more stable and robust global supply chain&#8221; in order to &#8220;bring real and tangible benefits to the countries in the region.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>China and Russia to Strengthen Cooperation</h2>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in Beijing on Wednesday. During their meeting, Xi told the Russian official that China is ready to strengthen cooperation with Russia, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>Xi stated that in addition to strengthening cooperation across multilateral platforms, such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the BRICS, and the G20, China and Russia should explore “potential” new economic, trade, and investment relations.</p>
<p>The Chinese leader told Mishustin: “We hope that the two sides will continue to take advantage of … the strong momentum of Sino-Russian cooperation, elevate cooperation in various fields … and continuously enrich the content of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between our two countries in the new era.” He was further quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>China is ready to work with Russia and countries of the Eurasian Economic Union to promote and connect the Belt and Road Initiative with the union in order to develop and establish a bigger regional market, ensure a more stable and robust global supply chain so [we can] bring real and tangible benefits to the countries in the region.</p></blockquote>
<p>Responding to Xi&#8217;s statements, Mishustin said Russia is “ready to work with China to promote multipolarization in the world and consolidate the international order based on international law.”</p>

<p>Xi emphasized China&#8217;s commitment to offer firm support to Russia on matters related to the two nations&#8217; respective core interests and enhance cooperation in multilateral forums. He commended the substantial level of mutual trust and coordination between China and Russia, stating that it “set an example of a new type of international relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prior to visiting Beijing and meeting Xi, Mishustin attended a Russian-Chinese Business Forum in Shanghai. At the forum, the chairman of Russia’s national economic development institution VEB.RF urged China and Russia to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-russia-urged-to-speed-up-creation-of-cutting-edge-payment-infrastructure-for-brics-and-sco-currencies/">speed up the establishment</a> of a new, “cutting-edge” payment system for SCO and BRICS currencies. Mishustin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-russia-urged-to-speed-up-creation-of-cutting-edge-payment-infrastructure-for-brics-and-sco-currencies/">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our relations with China keep getting stronger. This longstanding relationship is based on historical roots, mutual respect, and friendship.</p></blockquote>

The billionaire suggested that his companies Tesla and Twitter could partner with an AI firm similar to how Microsoft collaborates with Openai.</strong></p>
<h2>Elon Musk on AI: &#8216;There Should Be a Significant Third Horse in the Race&#8217;</h2>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk discussed a wide range of topics during a virtual appearance at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit in London on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) was among the topics the billionaire discussed. He believes that there should be a major competitor to Microsoft and Google in the AI race. The Tesla boss, who recently established an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-hires-new-ceo-for-twitter-she-will-be-starting-in-6-weeks/">AI company</a> called X.AI, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve got Openai and Microsoft, Google Deepmind … I think there should be a significant third horse in the race.</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk noted that his social media platform Twitter and his electric car company Tesla could potentially collaborate with an AI company, drawing a parallel to the partnership between Microsoft and Openai. Musk himself previously contributed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/elon-musk-used-to-say-he-put-100m-in-openai-but-now-its-50m-here-are-the-receipts/">millions of dollars</a> to Openai, the company behind the popular chatbot Chatgpt.</p>
<p>“Openai has a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">relationship</a> with Microsoft that seems to work fairly well &#8230; So it’s possible that X.AI and Twitter, Tesla would have something similar,&#8221; the Tesla executive described.</p>
<p>Musk, who recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-hires-new-ceo-for-twitter-she-will-be-starting-in-6-weeks/">appointed</a> Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter, also revealed that the social media company is not currently profitable. However, he claimed that it has the potential to achieve positive cash flow as early as next month.</p>

<h2>Musk Reaffirms Support for Dogecoin</h2>
<p>The Tesla billionaire also talked about cryptocurrency investing and his support for the meme crypto dogecoin (DOGE). &#8220;I&#8217;m not advising anyone to buy a crypto, or bet the farm on dogecoin, or anything like that,&#8221; he stressed, adding: &#8220;Maybe you should, but let me advise you that would be perhaps unwise.&#8221; Musk proceeded to reiterate his support for DOGE, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dogecoin is my favorite cryptocurrency because it has the best humor and has dogs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tesla CEO has long been a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-confirms-hell-keep-buying-and-supporting-dogecoin/">supporter</a> of dogecoin, calling it &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-real-reason-he-supports-dogecoin-many-people-at-tesla-spacex-own-doge/">the people’s crypto</a>.&#8221; He believes the meme cryptocurrency is best suited for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-bitcoin-store-of-value-dogecoin-transactions-time-names-him-person-of-the-year/">transactions</a>.</p>

This brings back key capital-efficient features such as concentrated liquidity and full range fees compounding, while incorporating significant security enhancements, including a newly audited smart contract, round-the-clock live scanning in collaboration with security partners, and the introduction of an Insurance Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KyberSwap Elastic will resume with improved smart contracts that have undergone internal audits as well as external audits with ChainSecurity and the community whitehat developer that spotted the smart contract vulnerability earlier in April. Further smart contract audits are being planned with other auditors. The comprehensive audit report by ChainSecurity can be found </span><a href="https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyberswap-elastic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to fortified smart contracts, KyberSwap has implemented enhanced security measures of its own. This includes a real-time monitoring page set to launch in Q3 2023 that continuously checks the status and security of the website, smart contracts, and more, providing the team with up-to-the-minute information and eliminating reliance on outdated data. Furthermore, KyberSwap has improved UX controls, expanded user education resources, and enhanced warning notices, empowering users with the knowledge and tools necessary to make informed decisions in the crypto space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further bolster security, KyberSwap is establishing an official Bug Bounty program to be released in June 2023 with Immunefi, inviting community developers to proactively evaluate the codebase and incentivizing their participation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our Elastic protocol resumption comes with upgraded smart contracts, a new security audit and coverage from KyberDAO, together with increased incentives, to offer users more rewarding, secure options for their liquidity,” said Victor Tran, KyberSwap Co-Founder and CEO. “KyberSwap returns to chart the path to leading DeFi in volume and protocol revenue, and make real an all-in-one, sustainable platform to help users Trade Smart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KyberSwap&#8217;s Elastic protocol is scheduled to resume operations on May 25, 2023, alongside the KyberSwap Returns campaign. This campaign brings forth exciting features such as NFT campaigns, the introduction of KyberAI, potential deployment to zkSync, and a multimillion-dollar Liquidity Mining campaign and ecosystem growth funds allocation. Notably, prominent staking and vault protocols, including Lido Finance and QiDao, have confirmed their participation, injecting liquidity into KyberSwap and reinvigorating liquidity mining incentives and other collaborative initiatives with the team.</span></p>

The study says the slowdown is probably temporary, with over half of the purloined funds being reclaimed by hacking victims in Q1 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Crime Cools: Hacks and Attacks Plummet 70% in Q1 2023</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.trmlabs.com">TRM Labs</a> approximates that close to $400 million was pilfered in Q1 2023 from almost 40 separate crypto infiltrations and attacks. This statistic has plunged by around 70% compared to Q1 2022, as <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/crypto-hacks-down-70-in-q1-2023">per the findings</a> of the blockchain analytics firm. Moreover, this year&#x2019;s first quarter recorded lower figures than any quarter of 2022 since the typical hack amounted to $10.5 million.</p>
<p>In contrast, the mean hack value during Q1 2022 reached over $30 million, experiencing a comparable count of nearly 40 incidents. A notable disparity between this year&#x2019;s and last year&#x2019;s breaches is the substantial amount of recoveries. &#x201C;To date, hacking victims have recovered over half of all stolen funds in Q1 2023,&#x201D; stated TRM Labs in its recent analysis.</p>
<p>TRM Labs investigators clarify that there is no &#x201C;obvious explanation for the lull,&#x201D; but cybercriminals might have been discouraged by two particular events. The first entails the U.S. government&#x2019;s allegations toward <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-authorities-charge-mango-markets-attacker-defendant-arrested-detained-in-puerto-rico/">Avraham Eisenberg</a> in connection with the Mango Markets occurrence last year. The second possible cause for the hiatus mentioned by researchers was the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-bans-ethereum-mixer-tornado-cash-platform-added-to-ofacs-sdn-list/">sanctions</a> imposed on ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) mixer Tornado Cash as a result of last year&#x2019;s U.S. Treasury actions.</p>

<p>The report from TRM Labs highlights that blockchain monitoring tools have advanced and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) have elevated their anti-money laundering (AML) criteria. These elements could have contributed to Q1&#x2019;s deceleration, but experts do not foresee its continuation. &#x201C;Unfortunately, this slowdown is most likely a temporary reprieve rather than a long-term trend,&#x201D; the blockchain intelligence company&#x2019;s Q1 2023 examination concludes.</p>

Moscow and Beijing intend to increase mutual trade beyond the $200-billion target this year, added the head of the Russian government. </strong></p>
<h2>Mishustin: 70% of Settlements Between Russia and China Conducted in National Currencies</h2>
<p>Around 70% of cross-border settlements between the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China are already carried out in national currencies — the ruble and the yuan, according to Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.</p>

<p>During talks in Beijing with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, he highlighted the positive trends in the trade relations between the two countries in a number of areas, stating, quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am sure that this year we will not only fulfill the task set by the heads of state to increase mutual trade to $200 billion ahead of schedule, but we will also exceed this milestone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mishustin emphasized the strategic nature of bilateral cooperation in the energy sector. “Russia ranks first in oil supplies to China, exports of natural gas, coal and electricity are growing,” the official detailed while also noting the expanding work “in the field of peaceful atom.”</p>

<p>The Russian premier also stressed that “in the new geopolitical conditions, the development of transport and logistics routes passing through the Russian-Chinese border is of particular importance,” pointing out that the two nations are accelerating the development of the necessary infrastructure to increase cargo transportation.</p>
<p>Moscow and Beijing have been fostering trade and economic ties amid confrontations with the West on multiple fronts. Considerable efforts have been made towards <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-dollarization-has-already-started-says-russias-foreign-minister-lavrov/">de-dollarization</a> of mutual settlements and transition to using national currencies within both the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">BRICS</a> bloc of emerging economies and the regional Shanghai Cooperation Organization (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worlds-largest-regional-organization-to-switch-to-settlements-in-national-currencies/">SCO</a>), of which they are members.</p>

Kwon was detained for providing false identification while boarding a flight to Dubai alongside a companion on March 23, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Co-Founder&#8217;s Bail Request Invalidated by Montenegrin High Court</h2>
<p>For the past 62 days, Do Kwon has remained incarcerated in Montenegro&#8217;s capital after being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-says-interior-minister/">apprehended</a> at Podgorica airport. Kwon, along with his accomplice Han Chong-joon, allegedly attempted to depart from Montenegro for Dubai.</p>
<p>However, their plans were thwarted when Kwon was discovered carrying forged identification documents. Montenegro&#8217;s interior minister, Filip Adzic, confirmed the arrest and subsequent detention of Kwon in Podgorica.</p>
<p>Ever since then, Kwon has found himself trapped within the confines of Montenegro&#8217;s prisons, and jails with <a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/4da56da5c.html">distressing reports</a> about the treatment of inmates and the dire state of <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/313615_MONTENEGRO-2021-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf">prison infrastructure</a> in the country.</p>
<p>At the start of May, a glimmer of hope emerged as Kwon and Chong-joon were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-to-be-released-on-e400000-bail-pleads-not-guilty-in-montenegro/">granted permission</a> by the lower court in Montenegro to secure their release by posting bail amounting to $430,500. However, the optimism was short-lived as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro">news surfaced</a> on Wednesday, May 24, 2023, revealing that a higher court had decisively annulled the lower court&#8217;s bail ruling.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, Bloomberg reporters received the news directly from Marija Rakovic, a court spokeswoman. Apart from Kwon&#8217;s ongoing legal woes in Podgorica, the co-founder of Terraform Labs also faces extradition requests from both the United States and South Korea. A <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1641554813010817025?s=20">report</a> released in late March revealed that Montenegro had allegedly decided to withhold Kwon&#8217;s extradition until he had undergone a trial and received proper legal proceedings.</p>

<p>“The basic court should now make another decision, taking into account what the high court ruled,” Rakovic informed Bloomberg during their conversation on Wednesday. This development comes in the wake of a Seoul court <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/seoul-court-greenlights-seizure-of-do-kwons-assets-worth-176-million/">granting permission</a> for the confiscation of Kwon&#8217;s assets, valued at $176 million.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/seoul-prosecutors-believe-terra-co-founder-do-kwon-still-in-possession-of-100-million-held-in-swiss-bank-account/">suspicions</a> that the co-founder of Terraform Labs may have stashed away $100 million in a Swiss bank account. Much like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the disgraced co-founder of FTX, Kwon appears to have had ample financial resources to fund his costly legal defenses thus far.</p>

Surpassing 20 alternative blockchain networks, Bitcoin-based NFT sales now secure the second position in the realm of blockchain sales, with only Ethereum reigning supreme. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin-Based NFTs Storm the Market, Surpassing 20 Blockchain Competitors</h2>
<p>Amidst the fervor surrounding the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-blockchain-continues-to-see-growth-in-ordinal-inscriptions-and-brc20-tokens/">Ordinal inscription trend</a>, Bitcoin-based NFTs have skyrocketed in popularity. The sales amassed over the past 30 days firmly established the network as the second-largest in terms of sales within this time frame. While Ethereum NFT sales saw $392.23 million, this past month Bitcoin sales tallied up to $173.28 million, up 408.29% from the month prior.</p>

<p>However, there has been a significant 47% decline in the number of buyers for Bitcoin-based NFTs, totaling 6,955 over the course of the past 30 days. Insights from <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">cryptoslam.io data</a> highlight that the leading NFT collection, in terms of sales during this period, is the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-590141 size-full" title="30-Day Bitcoin NFT Sales Surge to $173 Million, Securing Second Place in Blockchain Market" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss.jpg" alt="30-Day Bitcoin NFT Sales Surge to $173 Million, Securing Second Place in Blockchain Market" width="1280" height="575" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss-300x135.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss-1024x460.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss-768x345.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The BAYC collection garnered $39,307,853 in sales over the past month, closely followed by the Ordi BRC20 NFTs, which amassed a slightly lower amount at $38,375,984. Noteworthy sales also transpired within other Bitcoin-centric NFT collections, including uncategorized Ordinals, as well as Space Pepes.</p>

<p>Sales from uncategorized Ordinals reached $23,508,299, while Space Pepes accumulated $12,247,480 in sales. Additionally, the Bitcoin Frogs NFT collection hopped its way to $9,849,639, while $NALS NFTs secured around $6,818,592 in sales over the past 30 days. The Bitcoin blockchain took center stage as the birthplace of the top five most expensive NFT transactions during this period.</p>
<p>These included a <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/space-pepes/mint/2c2433f34d6d67cd157f86c2bccb1144fa57b467694aff5be4848456ab654c8fi0">$4.5 million sale</a> of a Space Pepe, as well as three uncategorized Ordinals that fetched prices exceeding a million dollars each. A Bitamigos NFT, for its part, commanded a <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/bitamigos/mint/367c15730877666163f438fc07518b4b28af14fc27a6f8f63b8469e000a0ea41i0">$1.3 million price tag</a>. It is also worth noting that nine out of the top-priced NFTs sold last month were derived from Bitcoin.</p>

<p>As of May 24, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain has surpassed <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/491a3f3f2967948e9ac6662e08bafa923d58643214f0b96f2b7e7fb351808ff5i0">nine million inscriptions</a>, coinciding with the surge in Bitcoin-based NFT sales. This trend has rewarded miners with an estimated value of approximately <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">1,495 BTC</a> or $40.27 million since the emergence of inscriptions on the chain.</p>
<p>Initially, skepticism surrounded the ability of Bitcoin to generate sufficient NFT activity to rival prominent NFT blockchains such as Solana and Polygon. However, the oldest blockchain network in existence so far has demonstrated its prowess as a formidable competitor.</p>
