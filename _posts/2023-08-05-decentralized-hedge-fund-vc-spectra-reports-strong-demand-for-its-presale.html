<p>London, United Kingdom, August 5th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Decentralized hedge fund VC Spectra has reported strong demand for its Stage 2 presale. The token sale has drawn considerable interest from early investors and underlined VC Spectra's potential to redefine the crypto industry.</p><p>Priding itself on democratizing access to investment opportunities, VC Spectra has carved a distinct niche for itself. The on-chain hedge fund extends the availability of early-stage investments to non-accredited investors, thereby bridging a significant market gap.</p><p>Investors opting for the SPCT token can leverage an array of unique benefits. These perks include quarterly dividends and buybacks, voting rights, and early access to initial coin offerings (ICOs).&nbsp;</p><p>The SPCT token, developed on the Bitcoin blockchain using the BRC-20 standard, provides a robust mechanism for decentralized trading, asset management, and transaction facilitation within the Spectra platform. The Spectra Token (SPCT) is the main currency within the Spectra ecosystem, enabling access to different services on the platform.</p><p>By implementing a deflationary model featuring a burn mechanism for the SPCT token, the decentralized hedge fund aims to decrease token circulation gradually. When coupled with VC Spectra's unique investment offerings, this novel approach further solidifies SPCT 's standing in the crypto market.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vc Spectra public presale is currently in Stage 2 and has already seen robust demand. The SPCT token, which started at $0.008 during Stage 1, increased to $0.011 in Stage 2. In the upcoming Stage 3, the token price will increase to $0.025. This is an increase of 213% from the initial token price. Currently, VC Spectra (SPCT) is offering a 25% bonus for all investor deposits.</p><p>About VC Spectra</p><p>Spectra is a leading firm driving innovation in Fintech and blockchain through strategic investments and ICOs, empowering financial growth by harnessing cutting-edge technologies.</p><p>Spectra VC is a venture capital fund that invests in blockchain and technology-based projects with the goal of generating returns for investors.</p><p>Find out more about the VC Spectra presale here:</p><p>Presale&nbsp;|&nbsp;Website&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;Telegram&nbsp;|&nbsp;Twitter</p>ContactPaul HubwardVC Spectrapr@hubward.co
