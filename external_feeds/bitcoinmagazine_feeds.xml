Then, <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-ordinals-a-beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-nfts">a late 2021 privacy upgrade</a> had the unintended consequence of allowing data storage on the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/quantifying-bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals">NFT-like inscriptions</a> and BRC-20 tokens, both applying <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">Ordinal Theory</a> for asset tracking. </p><p>The popularity of NFT-like Ordinal inscriptions and the experimental BRC-20 token standard has <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">driven up transaction costs</a> across the Bitcoin network. The frothy demand for “stamping” limited block space with new data pushed transaction costs so high that in May 2023, Binance twice <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/08/binance-pauses-bitcoin-withdrawals-for-the-second-time-in-24-hours/">had to pause BTC withdrawals</a>, a risky and undesirable step for a global exchange. To help manage the transaction costs, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/501886">announced it would start using the Lightning Network</a> — a decentralized, Layer 2 network designed for fast transactions bypassing the underlying Bitcoin blockchain— to process BTC withdrawals.</p><p>While some argue that Bitcoin should stick to being digital gold, I don’t see it that way. </p><p>As a store of value, bitcoin will continue to provide a trustless alternative to central banking; other uses of its immutable blockchain don’t diminish this function. On the contrary, emergent uses of the Bitcoin blockchain will drive more efficient use of the limited block space, leading to broad adoption of Lightning Network as a scaling solution for bitcoin as a global currency. The Lightning Network’s growth will provide a trustless alternative to centralized payment processors, expanding Bitcoin’s utility.</p><h2>Challenges Faced By BRC-20 Tokens</h2><p>The BRC-20 token standard is extremely new — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-brc-20-token-standard-an-overview">created in March 2023</a>. If its name sounds familiar, that’s because it’s somewhat akin to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/">ERC-20 tokens</a> such as Shiba Inu and MakerDAO that run atop the Ethereum network. Whereas Bitcoin has traditionally been about storing and transmitting value, BRC-20s allow for other assets to be “minted” in an Ordinal inscription. Now, a slew of BRC-20s have popped up for trading and speculation, many in the form of meme tokens, from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/piza-brc-20/">PIZA</a> to <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/meme-brc20/">MEME</a>. As of June 26, 2023, the market cap for BRC-20 tokens was over $260 million, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/brc-20">according to CoinGecko</a>. </p><p>But all of this minting is driving bitcoin transaction costs higher. That’s not necessarily bad for bitcoin miners, who earn BTC by processing transactions. CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/08/ordinals-upend-bitcoin-mining-pushing-transaction-fees-above-mining-reward-for-first-time-in-years/">reported</a> in early May 2023 that some BTC miners were earning more by collecting transaction fees than they were by creating new BTC. That’s quite a lot, considering each block reward currently nets miners 6.25 BTC (worth roughly $188,000 at the time of writing).</p><p>As for whether this is good for users, that’s debatable. The average bitcoin transaction fee recently hit a two-year high, <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">peaking at $30.91</a> on May 8, 2023, despite a bear market; those abstaining from BRC-20s are likely grumbling about increased fees. On the other hand, the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard has inspired deeper conversations about network scaling for Bitcoin.</p><h2>Already Making An Impact</h2><p>At the moment, BRC-20s lack some of the utility of their ERC-20 cousins. They don’t, for instance, use smart contracts, and their utility is mostly the same as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-pfp-nfts/">PFP NFTs</a>, leading many to argue they’re not worth the cost.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the demand for Bitcoin-based tokens is sustainable or whether such activity will get redirected to other, more permissive or centralized networks. </p><p>In one scenario, higher fees could force Bitcoin’s traditional users away from the network. This is unlikely. Bitcoin’s unchanging and conservative monetary policy remains the primary attraction; the network has no real competition in this regard as a hedge to monetary debasement.</p><p>But assuming Ordinal inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens show the same staying power as memecoins and NFTs on other networks — Shiba Inu, remember, has a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">market cap of $5 billion</a> and Bored Apes are virtually a household name — they will keep driving transaction fees above their historical average.</p><p>This could have long-term impacts on Bitcoin users.</p><p>In particular, higher transaction costs create a demand for more efficient transactions. While some of this can be done at a protocol level (e.g., <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-segwit">SegWit</a>, the contentious 2017 upgrade to Bitcoin that enabled leaner transaction sizes by separating the signature data from the transaction data), much of it can come from scaling technologies on a second layer. </p><p>Enter: the Lightning Network, which batches transactions via long-term smart contracts and uses Bitcoin’s underlying security to allow fast and cheap payments.</p><h2>Future Solutions</h2><p>Lightning Network fees are extremely modest compared to on-chain counterparts. While the fees do fluctuate, the overall network fees have not increased as a result of BRC-20s or inscriptions. The network currently charges fees to reward network node operators. According to data available via Amboss’ Bitcoin Lightning Network analytics platform, the <a href="https://amboss.space/stats?params=eyJtZXRyaWMiOiJmZWVfcmF0ZV9tZXRyaWNzIiwiY2F0ZWdvcnkiOiJuZXR3b3JrTWV0cmljcyIsInN1Ym1ldHJpYyI6Im1lZGlhbiIsInRpbWVFbnVtIjoiMXkiLCJzY2FsZUVudW0iOiJBYnNvbHV0ZSJ9">median fee remains 0.002%</a>. Compare that to traditional payment networks, which charge <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/credit-card-processing-fees/">2% to 3%</a> of the payment amount every time you swipe your credit card.</p><p>The Bitcoin community is currently subsidizing the creation of the payment network, driving Lightning fees extremely low. Even with increased demand over time, sustainable fee rates for Lightning should grow to around 0.03%, based on less generous operator behavior.</p><h2>Primed To Become The Default Global Payments Processor</h2><p>The combination of Bitcoin monetary policy and Lightning’s transaction network is a potent one. Bitcoin has long presented itself as an alternative to a broken central banking system. But through competitive uses of its unforgivingly tight blockchain, the efficiency gained through Lightning transactions is more prescient than ever. </p><p>Though the Lightning Network has been years in the making, it is maturing at the perfect time — ready to enable billions of transactions across the network — and become the global de facto payment processor.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jesse Shrader.

I've visited 45 countries, lived in nine and covered all continents except Antarctica.</p><p>After years of globetrotting, I thought that part of my life would have been over by now. But just when I began to feel the desire to settle down and set roots, something happened: I discovered Bitcoin. My life, then, was radically changed. Not only has it transformed my worldview, but it's also reignited a fire in me to keep moving and seek out people who have gone through the same awakening. </p><p>Combining my passions for adventure and hard money, I've recently begun to focus on visiting emerging Bitcoin circular economies across the globe. From helping me save time and money to making me feel more protected and connected with the people I meet along the way, using Bitcoin has been a game changer for my travel experiences. </p><p>In this piece, I discuss how Bitcoin has helped me fix common money issues known to travelers everywhere and how it's made my journeys more special in multiple ways. </p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin Helps Travelers Save Time</h2><p>If I had a sat for every time I've had to deal with payment-related issues in a foreign country, I'd have a big enough stack to make Michael Saylor jealous. Whether it was finding a currency exchange with decent rates, looking for a store that accepted my cards or calling my bank to resolve credit card issues, I've wasted so much precious time on these problems that just thinking about them frustrates me.</p><p>In a few scenarios, it's even resulted in the disruption of my itinerary and a significant dose of anxiety, as when it happened during a trip to a remote island in the Philippines in 2015. Though I had a great time, it wasn't long before I found myself running out of cash, with no ATMs and no currency exchange offices in the area. Ultimately, I was saved by the only Western Union office in town — when it finally opened two days after my crisis began.</p><p>Had the locals and I known about Bitcoin then, my journey would have gone as planned, and my stress levels would have remained stable the entire time. </p><p>Fast forward eight years, and I returned to the Philippines, but this time, my experience with money matters was much better. Why? Because I chose the island of Boracay, <a href="https://thechainsaw.com/business/bitcoin-island-boracay-philippines/#:~:text=Not%20only%20can%20tourists%20pay,local%20currency%2C%20the%20Philippine%20Peso.">also known as “Bitcoin Island,”</a>&nbsp;as my destination. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Thanks to the many merchants now accepting Philippine pesos via the Bitcoin Lightning Network rail, I was able to deal with all payments digitally. This prevented me from wasting time dealing with cash, ATMs and currency exchange offices and allowed me to do more of what I wanted to do: enjoy the island. </p><p>Bitcoin has helped me save time. </p><h2>Bitcoin Helps Travelers Save Money</h2><p>As a backpacker, I was always very conscious of my budget. Street food, hostels and overnight bus rides were my bread and butter, but one thing I could never avoid was those unwanted and often unexpected expenses that come with the territory. </p><p>Think of credit card fees, which, in Guatemala, <a href="https://www.frommers.com/destinations/guatemala/planning-a-trip/money">can cost up to 10%</a>, and ATM fees which, in Thailand, <a href="https://www.thethailandlife.com/atm-thailand#:~:text=Withdrawal%20fees&amp;text=The%20large%20majority%20of%20banks,per%20transaction%20(approximately%20%244.50).">can amount to $6 per withdrawal</a> for foreign bank cards plus your bank fees. Even currency exchange rates are costly, as I have found that they generally charge 10% for their services. These small numbers may not seem like much, but they add up quickly, which means a lot for someone traveling on a budget.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTg3NDc1NTAxNTI0OTQ4/bitcoin-accepted-here.png" height="371" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>But that has never been an issue when visiting Bitcoin communities. That's because the only fees involved in bitcoin payments are transaction costs, which are often negligible or non-existent. And I've also enjoyed the benefits beyond these hotspots, as many businesses nowadays offer a discount if you pay in bitcoin. If you've ever bought tickets to a Bitcoin conference, you might know what I'm talking about. </p><p>Bitcoin has helped me save money. </p><h2>Bitcoin Enhances Travelers’ Safety</h2><p>Whenever I share tales of my solo adventures, the topic of safety always comes up. While street smarts and wise decisions have helped me avoid real danger, I've had to deal with a different kind of unpleasantness multiple times: fraud. </p><p>In Vietnam, I got scammed by a taxi driver with fake Vietnamese dong notes. In Bali, my travel card was cloned, and I only found out when the culprits tried to withdraw money in the middle of the night. To this day, I have no idea how they did it. And I've lost track of how many times I felt my heart racing while using an ATM in a questionable location or at odd hours of the day or night and walking away with three days’ worth of cash in my bag.</p><p>Navigating exclusively on Bitcoin eliminates all of those concerns for me. And it makes perfect sense. When you're not dealing with cash, ATMs or credit cards, your risks are minimized, and your peace of mind is maximized. </p><p>My only goal is keeping my phone safe, though even if I lose it, I can still access my funds by recovering my wallet on a new device. That's why it's important to back up your seed phrase, people!</p><p>Bitcoin has enhanced my safety.</p><h2>Bitcoin Makes Traveling More Meaningful</h2><p>Poverty, weakening currencies and countless unbanked individuals are some of the biggest afflictions that developing countries face today. Call it selfish or exaggerated, but paying locals for their goods and services in bitcoin feels more rewarding than giving them pieces of paper that are guaranteed to lose value.</p><p>During a visit to Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala, for instance, it was wonderful to see how many merchants in the local market accepted bitcoin. It allowed them to attract more customers, make more sales and prompted more conversations about the significant changes they've gone through since using bitcoin as money.</p><p>Being able to pay hard-working people in Bitcoin feels more authentic and makes for a more memorable exchange and bonding experience. It renders tourism more meaningful and worth all the time and effort that goes into planning a trip to these unique places around the world. </p><p>Bitcoin has made my travels more meaningful.</p><p>Needless to say, my travel experience hasn't been the same since I discovered Bitcoin. Understanding money and its profound effects on every aspect of our lives has significantly changed the way I look at the world and walk through life everywhere I go. </p><p>As an avid wanderer, I want to see more places embrace Bitcoin in the future. It will help empower the communities, boost the economies and attract the attention of Bitcoiners like myself, who will want to encourage and support them in any way they can. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by HodlingCarla.

In the realm of Bitcoin heresy, before you prepare to hang me from the gallows for that statement, permit me to express my final thoughts. Allow me to provide a brief introduction — I am not a galaxy-brained, shadowy super coder. I must admit to my relative ignorance in the fields of computer science and cryptography. I do not work within the Bitcoin industry. Instead, I am an ordinary pleb, toiling away in construction to make ends meet, striving to maintain humility and gain a comprehensive understanding of the true nature of Bitcoin. So, why do I say that Bitcoin must change?</p><p>Let us commence by reflecting upon the adage, "Not your keys, not your coins," which resounds as one of the loudest mantras in the Bitcoin community, and rightfully so. When your private keys are held by a centralized exchange or custodian on your behalf, you effectively surrender control over your funds. This situation introduces counterparty risk, as you become reliant on the security practices and integrity of the third party entrusted with your keys.</p><p>The philosophy underlying "not your keys, not your coins" aligns with the broader principles of decentralization and censorship resistance. These principles seek to empower individuals with financial sovereignty and eliminate the necessity for intermediaries. It underscores the significance of personal responsibility, security and self-reliance in this digital era where governments increasingly employ technology as a tool for controlling individuals.</p><p>Now, you may ask, what is the issue at hand? Well, the truth of the matter is that, under the current implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, self custody does not scale. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts choose not to critically analyze this reality. However, we cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality. </p><p>Recently, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">BRC-20 minting issue</a> thrust this challenge into the spotlight within the community. The event triggered an explosion in the base layer fee market, resulting in exorbitant costs to confirm transactions. Regardless of your opinion on BRC-20, the incident provided us with a glimpse of the future if the network continues to expand. Try to envision, in all honesty, the exacerbation of this situation with 8 billion users. As activist Anita Posch pointed out <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1655459803957739520?t=vheLiKcJZV5pMnemaWokrA&amp;s=09">in this tweet</a>, custodial solutions would become the only means of onboarding new network participants. While there are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fedimint-adds-new-bitcoin-custody-solutions">federated protocols aiming to disintermediate custodial risk by spreading it among multiple custodians</a>, this solution remains fundamentally different from self custody.</p><p>Recently, human rights activist Alex Gladstein <a href="https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1662128272975745024?t=41V9ClnVRMa7f2s7S3WTvQ&amp;s=09">posed a thought experiment focused on this issue</a>:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1662128272975745024"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>To my dismay, over 54% of respondents to his scenario deemed it a success. This sentiment is perilous, as such a scenario undermines Bitcoin's ethos of self sovereignty and censorship resistance. It may not come as a surprise, though; this poll may indicate that more people prioritize "number go up (NGU)" over individual liberty.</p><p>Whenever the scaling issue arises, a common response is to invoke the notion that Bitcoin scales in layers, and that the base layer can ossify while additional layers facilitate the onboarding of the global population. However, <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_trollz/status/1663640665056485376?t=4W29G5__Hr04xZ93lFFlWQ&amp;s=09">as Shinobi reminds us</a>, "Layer two is not a magic incantation. For layer twos to optimize and improve, new functionality on the base layer is required. Layer twos are literally just things built on the functionality of layer one. The limitations of layer two are a direct result of layer one limits."</p><p>Accepting this reality can be daunting, especially for individuals like myself who are not computer science majors or cryptographers. We adore Bitcoin, and the prospect of change can be intimidating because we are unaware of what we don't know. There is a non-zero possibility that any alteration could lead to Bitcoin's failure. Consequently, many of us stubbornly dig our heels into the sand and advocate for the ossification of the base layer to ensure, in our minds, that Bitcoin remains intact.</p><p>If you, like me, believe that "not your keys, not your coins" should be an option for all participants in the network, present and future, we must embrace Bitcoin's malleability before it is too late. In the <a href="https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1622593393036611585?t=0vUtwlo7p7hbnCQ-MteRpw&amp;s=09">words of Jameson Lopp</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"Bitcoin is sound money. But it's not just digital gold. Bitcoin is programmable money. Unlike gold, it is a technology that can be upgraded. We need not throw that property out the window. There is still much about Bitcoin that can be improved without violating its soundness... The nature of how network protocols ossify means that the changes necessarily must happen earlier rather than later; it becomes impossible to coordinate changes once a protocol is adopted at a mainstream level.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/should-we-be-worried-about-bitcoin-ossification/?sh=73256e762b6a&amp;s=09">quote Lopp once again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Ossification is a side effect of growth, not an explicit decision unto itself. There is no way to really know when we’ve gone too far until newly proposed changes simply cease to gain any traction. Now, the real problems of ossification become clear: once we cross an invisible line in the future, Bitcoin will be ‘set’ as it is, with no more updates practically possible.</p><p>“Before this happens, developers and users need to think about what Bitcoin’s ultimate code base should look like. We can see from past debates surrounding things like the SegWit fork that bitcoiners are both divided and passionate about many issues, and there’s almost certainly no answer to this question that everyone will agree on. This is, of course, part of the problem driving ossification in the first place.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Only time will reveal whether we have already crossed that invisible line of base-layer ossification. However, until that day arrives, it is crucial for all users who cherish Bitcoin for its properties of self sovereignty and censorship resistance, as well as its potential to truly separate money from the state, to embrace changes with an open mind. Engage in the various discussions within the developer community.

Fiat food, fiat jobs… and fiat athletes. In this article, I introduce ideas about what it means to be a Bitcoin athlete — an archetype that I seek to embody in my professional pickleball career and a template for the 21st century professional athlete. </p><h2>Fiat Athletes Vs. Bitcoin Athletes</h2><p>Fiat athletes compete to earn fiat money. They store their time and energy (aka, their wealth) in manipulated money that steals from them, they trust companies not to censor them and they often live high time preference lifestyles. </p><p>Bitcoin athletes are a new breed of elite, professional athletes. Bitcoin athletes store their wealth in sound money that protects them from theft, they leverage decentralized protocols like Nostr to create uncensorable, peer-to-peer relationships with their fans, they embody Bitcoin values and they live a low time preference lifestyle. </p><p>Fiat athletes build digital identities on platforms created by companies that have the ability to censor what they say and that divide them from their fans. Bitcoin athletes build digital identities on open-source protocols that can’t censor what they say. These protocols enable Bitcoin athletes to connect directly with their fans. </p><p>Fiat athletes trust banks to hold their money and leak energy with every exchange between fiat currencies when traveling to different countries. Bitcoin athletes hold their own money and conserve energy by using global money when traveling to compete. </p><p>Fiat athletes trust politicians to maintain monetary integrity. Bitcoin athletes run nodes and verify that the monetary policy of Bitcoin is enforcing a 21 million supply cap. </p><p>Fiat athletes live fiat lifestyles and propagate fiat values to their fans. Bitcoin athletes live Bitcoin lifestyles and propagate the values of the Bitcoin protocol to their fans — the values of truth, freedom and personal responsibility. </p><p>Fiat athletes live at the mercy of banks and politicians who control their money and the companies who control their financial sponsorship. Bitcoin athletes are sovereign and without masters. Their money is governed by mathematics and they are directly supported by their fans, who zap them sats at the speed of light. </p><p>Fiat athletes are motivated by fame and fiat riches. Bitcoin athletes are motivated by the mission to spread financial literacy to 8 billion people on earth and unlock unprecedented peace and human flourishing. Bitcoin athletes play for a purpose beyond money. They’re playing to save the money. </p><p>Fiat athletes use centralized money, centralized social media and centralized sponsorship models. They have relationships with intermediaries (banks, platforms and companies) that have the power to censor or control them if they don’t tow the line. Bitcoin athletes use decentralized money, decentralized social media and decentralized sponsorship models. They use protocols in order to restore direct relationships with their fans and reduce (or eliminate) their reliance on banks, platforms and companies. </p><h2>Winning With Bitcoin</h2><p>I believe a Bitcoin world will forge Bitcoin athletes, this new type of professional athlete who is financially energized directly by their fans, lives in alignment with values of the Bitcoin protocol and uses their influence to improve financial literacy and fix the money. The elite athlete of the 21st century will build their career on Bitcoin and be powered by the Lightning Network. </p><p>As a professional pickleball player, I’m on a mission to demonstrate this new template myself. I seek to master my sport by testing myself against the best pickleball players in the world and I play for Bitcoin. </p><p>Part of my mission as a Bitcoin athlete is to help fiat athletes make the jump over to a Bitcoin world, to help them understand Bitcoin and secure their bits of information in cyberspace (property, identity, data, etc.) with encrypted energy. That process often begins with me sending them 21 sats after a game so they can experience the magic of Bitcoin firsthand and then helping them set up a Nostr account so that fans can directly support them financially. </p><p>I believe the professional athletes of the 21st century will be powered by Bitcoin. They will connect directly with their fans with zaps and will store their life energy in scarce, digital, encrypted money. They will run nodes, share proof of work and connect with fans on Nostr. They will be uncensorable, unstoppable and sovereign in their quest to financially support their careers. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Obiwan Satoshi.

The VLS solution, an open-source Rust library and reference implementation, separates a user's private keys from their Lightning node, providing an extra layer of protection against potential compromises and theft of funds. According to the announcement, VLS offers a level of security unmatched by other solutions in the ecosystem.</p><p>"We're thrilled to announce the VLS beta release, a major step forward for Lightning network security, and we're excited to share it with developers and companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem," stated the VLS team. They encouraged developers and companies to try out the VLS Beta release, participate in the feedback process and test the software with sample CLN or LDK nodes to help enhance the security of the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p><p>The VLS beta release introduces various features designed to safeguard against malicious nodes and enhance user protection. These features include working with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery capabilities, a complete set of Layer 2 and Layer 1 validation rules, heartbeat generation and an allowlist for approved destinations. However, it's important to note that while VLS is secure against common ways of stealing user funds, it may not cover all possible scenarios of fund loss. Therefore, the team advises running VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release.</p><p>VLS provides a unique approach to Lightning Network security by sequestering private keys and secrets in hardened policy signing devices. The reference implementation in Rust ensures that proposed transactions are safe to sign by applying a comprehensive set of validation rules. By incorporating UTXO Set Oracles to provide proofs of unspent UTXOs, VLS offers additional protection even in the case of a complete compromise of the node software.</p><p>Looking ahead, the VLS roadmap includes plans to run signers on platforms with limited resources, improve performance for embedded processors, and add features such as extended BOLT-12 support and VSS integration. Additionally, the team aims to enable the use of multiple signers using multi-sig with Lightning keys, pending the maturity of key protocols like Taproot, MuSig2 and FROST.</p><p>The VLS beta release represents a significant advancement in securing the Bitcoin Lightning Network and holds promise for developers, companies and users seeking enhanced protection for their funds within the network.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5ODk5NzMzNTMwMDYwNTQy/20220601_btcfinal_best-protected--a-computer-for-bitcoin-transactions-installing-linux-mint---arman-parman.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Proof Of Work?

Then they apply a cryptographic hash function of the previous block's header to the new block. Finally, they try to solve the proof-of-work problem. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/who-created-bitcoin">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> adopted a proof-of-work (PoW) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-nakamoto-consensus-bitcoin">consensus mechanism</a> to resolve the Byzantine Generals' Problem, establishing a transparent and objective protocol.</p><h2>What Is Proof Of Work (PoW)?</h2><p>Proof of work is literally proof that work has been done to validate the network’s transactions and generate new bitcoin. It is the consensus mechanism and algorithm that uses computing power to verify transactions and add them to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">Bitcoin blockchain</a>. Such a mechanism allows the Bitcoin network to be trusted and remain decentralized. </p><p>PoW resolves the Byzantine generals' problems, which may fail a distributed computer system for different reasons, not only of malicious nature, but perhaps a software defect, a hardware malfunction, or a well-coordinated attack by a bad actor. They can all be difficulties that prevent nodes from reaching consensus on distributed networks. </p><p>The Byzantine Generals’ Problem is only common to decentralized systems, where it’s more difficult to come to an agreement. </p><p>Bitcoin resolves the Byzantine Generals’ Problem by providing a way to communicate and transfer value safely without the need to trust one another through a network of nodes that agree on the truth before it is timestamped. Once one node has recorded a transaction, a copy is propagated to all other nodes in the network. PoW was created to achieve this objective. </p><h3>Why Is Proof Of Work Important?</h3><p>Proof of work is often misunderstood or underestimated, as many consider it a wasted effort on a poor system design; they claim that entering a transaction on any other digital ledger could be made instantly and with no effort. This is why proof of work is necessary for the ledger’s security and how it prevents any one party from compromising it. The effort is not wasted however, if it empowers a network to be an alternative to the current monetary system and its various flaws.</p><p>The significance of proof of work lies in its ability to serve as a tangible expense for generating bitcoin and safeguarding its credibility. It would be exorbitant to execute a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network with the intention of creating counterfeit coins or carrying out deceitful Bitcoin transactions. If any entity tries to compromise the Bitcoin network, it would have to redo all previous proof of work quickly enough to outpace the network's continuous proof of work. For this reason, Bitcoin has <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">unforgeable costliness</a> characteristics and is immutable since it is nearly impossible to change confirmed transactions.</p><p>To maintain stability in the proof-of-work system, Nakamoto implemented a simple yet genius solution referred to as the difficulty adjustment algorithm, which regulates the difficulty level of discovering a new block every 10 minutes. This is crucial to prevent the discovery of new blocks from happening too quickly as more miners join the network. It also ensures that the mining process does not become too slow if the mining activity drops. </p><h3>Proof Of Work Versus Proof Of Stake</h3><p>We’ve seen how <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-why-bitcoin-wont-change">PoW is a good use of energy</a> to secure Bitcoin while forcing everyone to adhere to the same fixed rules, including the interdiction to issue more bitcoin to increase the supply.</p><p>The security difference between the two consensus mechanisms holds great importance. Proof of work requires energy consumption to ensure that Bitcoin maintains its position as the most secure network worldwide, whereas proof of stake (PoS) does not resolve the problem of possible interference from malicious entities. Instead, PoS sacrifices security for scalability, making it a faster blockchain, albeit one that cannot be trusted. Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism is expensive, and motivates participants to only publish truthful information. </p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/proof-of-stake">Proof of stake</a> is the consensus mechanism for most altcoins, digital penny stocks, and other Ponzi schemes marketed as alternatives to bitcoin. Its consensus mechanism works through “staking,” which requires investors to lock the chosen protocol’s tokens into the system so that the token cannot be spent. However, the higher the number of tokens staked, the higher the chance of validating a block of transactions. </p><p>Considering that most altcoin tokens are issued to insiders and developers before they became publicly available, it’s easy to figure out how poorly decentralization is designed in proof-of-stake networks.</p><p>The primary differences between the two mechanisms are highlighted here:</p><h4>Proof Of Work</h4><ul><li>Validation is performed by a network of miners</li><li>Competitive nature uses lots of energy and computational power to determine the probability of finding a new block</li><li>Proof of work has a real-world physical cost to production, which insulates the network from attack</li><li>There is an economic and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-is-a-net-benefit-to-the-environment">environmental advantage to proof of work</a></li></ul><h4>Proof Of Stake</h4><ul><li>Validation is done by participants who offer their tokens as collateral</li><li>Less energy is used, but the amount of stake or number of coins determines the probability of validating a new block</li><li>Proof of stake has no real-world cost of production, which leaves the network vulnerable to attack</li><li>There is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">no environmental advantage to proof of stake</a></li></ul><p>In proof of stake, it’s easy to acquire a 51% stake and then change the rules of the protocol to one’s benefit, and relatively straightforward to censor network participation and activity, such as declining a person or entity's transactions by not including them.</p><h2>How Proof Of Work Works</h2><p>Proof of work was previously achievable using central processing units (CPUs) and graphic processing units (GPUs). However, due to the vast amount of electricity required, it can now only be performed using specialized computers operated by miners, known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).These serve to input transaction data, information from the previous block header, and a nonce (random number) to guess the result of hash functions. </p><p>Hash functions are mathematical functions. In Bitcoin, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-mining-protects-the-bitcoin-network">SHA-256 is the hash function algorithm</a> that transforms your input data — anything that can be represented in ones and zeros — into the output, a string of 64 characters, which will be unique and perfectly correlated to the input data.</p><p>From how it works, it is impossible to figure out a resulting output from a publicly visible input other than through expensive ASIC-generated rapid guessing. </p><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining">miners want to optimize their work</a>. To be profitable, they must increase the number of hashes (or guesses) per second that their devices can produce while using the cheapest and most reliable energy source.</p><p>Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment makes mining an even more competitive industry.<em> </em>In simple terms, proof of work is similar to buying lottery tickets with a prize draw every 10 minutes. The more tickets you buy, the greater the statistical likelihood of winning the lottery. In ASIC terms, a Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro can operate at 104TH/s, which basically means 104 trillion guesses, or tickets, per second.</p><p>Due to the increased competition, it's become harder for individual or solo miners to mine bitcoin since 2012, when ASICs became necessary. Yet, they can now join a mining pool to increase their chances of getting rewarded with bitcoin, though the funds would be split among the pool members. </p><h2>Advantages And Disadvantages</h2><p>Proof of work is necessary to keep Bitcoin secure, immutable, and always decentralized. Here are the primary benefits and drawbacks of Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism.</p><h3>Advantages </h3><ul><li>Decentralization, i.e., the real breakthrough of the technology</li><li>Censorship resistant, as a result of decentralization</li><li>Immutability, the blockchain is nearly impossible to reverse</li><li>It’s a fair and objective system based on robust protocol rules and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-rules-are-enforced-by-physics">laws of physics</a></li><li>High level of security: PoW economically incentivizes miners to protect the network</li><li>Carbon and methane capture: Bitcoin exploits wasted energy to issue more coins and verify transactions</li><li>By monetizing energy, PoW speeds up the rollout of renewable energy networks, and also improves load balancing on existing grids, making them more efficient and secure</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Slower transaction speeds</li><li>Mining expenses (OPEX &amp; CAPEX) are very high but necessary for proof of work</li><li>PoW consumes a lot of energy, but this has been <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-is-a-net-benefit-to-the-environment">proven to encourage</a> innovation in renewables and wasted energy exploitation</li></ul><h2>Criticism Of Proof Of Work</h2><p>Criticism of Bitcoin's energy consumption is common. Since Bitcoin requires a substantial amount of energy to protect the network, proof of work is an easy attack vector by those whose interests are more aligned with the pre-existing fiat financial system. </p><p>However, the widespread narrative fails to acknowledge that Bitcoin is, in reality, driving innovation in the technology that generates clean energy and exploits wasted energy.</p><p>How? Bitcoin miners need to find the most cost-effective energy sources to be profitable. As a result, affordable energy for Bitcoin mining is increasingly coming from renewables, as well as from wasted and "stranded" energy sources, rather than relying on fossil fuels.</p><h3>Renewables</h3><p>Since renewables — primarily wind and solar — are among the cheapest energy sources, Bitcoin miners are incentivized to subsidize their innovation, to the benefit of everyone.</p><p>Many misunderstand that energy consumption doesn’t directly produce carbon dioxide emissions, but the source may. The effect on carbon emission comes from energy production, not consumption. </p><h3>Wasted Energy</h3><p>Flared natural gas is an example of wasted energy: To avoid the high costs of transporting natural gas from remote locations, oil companies that produce it are recommended to either release the gas into the atmosphere or literally “flare” it to limit environmental impact. However, flaring it safely also has a cost, and if gas drillers could use a gas generator to power Bitcoin miners, that wasted energy is turned into good usage — producing bitcoin!</p><h3>Stranded Energy</h3><p>As Bitcoin mining operations can be located anywhere in the world, they are increasingly attracted to “stranded” energy, which is often too remote for populated areas, like ocean currents or desert sun. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/profiting-on-biogas-with-bitcoin-mining">Biogas is another such option</a>, which produces reliable energy, but is oftentimes not connected to the grid. </p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>How is the difficulty level of the proof-of-work problem determined?</p><p>Depending on how many hashes per second are mining on the network, the hash function’s complexity will increase or decrease accordingly so that it takes miners an average of 10 minutes to find a new block across the global network.</p><p>Can brute force solve the proof-of-work problem?</p><p>The only way to resolve the proof-of-work problem is through brute force, a general problem-solving technique, and an algorithmic paradigm that searches all the possible solutions to a given problem before finding the most satisfactory one.</p><p>What happens to proof of work when all the bitcoin has been mined?</p><p>When all the bitcoin has been mined, proof of work will still be needed for validating transactions, for which miners will receive a fee.</p><p>Are there any viable alternatives to proof of work?</p><p>To produce a decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant, secure cryptocurrency like bitcoin, there is no secure alternative to proof of work.</p><p>What happens if two miners solve the proof of work problem for the same block simultaneously?</p><p>The block that appears in the longest chain will be chosen, which is the one that has the “greatest combined difficulty” of the hashes used and took the most computational power to create it. </p><h2>The Final Word </h2><p>Purposely misleading politicians and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/greenpeace-intensifies-campaign-against-bitcoin-after-ethereum-merge">organizations</a> have an advantage in criticizing Bitcoin’s proof of work and financing projects to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/white-house-condemns-energy-use-of-mining-bitcoin">discredit Bitcoin</a> for its energy consumption. The advantage is to keep the current system as it is, beneficial to them, under the disguise that Bitcoin is wrong and harmful to humanity and the Earth.</p><p>Bitcoin is disruptive; it’s the hope humanity needs and must be discovered and understood to be fully appreciated. Proof of work is necessary to empower the transition to a new monetary system and a different world, and the effort required to produce it makes it even more worthy.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5MDMyNTU3MDg4NTQ4NjI1/proof-of-work-feature-image-w_text.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sabre56 Partners With Arkon Energy For Ohio Data Center Consultancy Deal]]></title><description><![CDATA[Leading hosting provider Sabre56 deepens its strategic partnership with Arkon Energy, consulting on their new Ohio data center acquisition.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sabre56-partners-with-arkon-energy-for-ohio-data-center-consultancy-deal</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sabre56-partners-with-arkon-energy-for-ohio-data-center-consultancy-deal</guid><category><![CDATA[Data Center]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 14:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTQ3/bitcoin-code.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.sabre56.com/">Sabre56</a>, a leading hosting provider and Bitcoin and digital asset mining consultancy, has signed a consultancy deal with <a href="https://www.arkonenergy.com/">Arkon Energy</a> for the management of Arkon's recently acquired data center in Hannibal, Ohio.

In a recent hearing at the Senate Banking Committee, she cited <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/chinese-businesses-fueling-the-fentanyl-epidemic-receive-millions-in-cryptocurrency-payments">a report</a> from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, indicating that digital currencies, particularly bitcoin, are being used to fund the fentanyl trade in China. But this is a clear obfuscation of the facts and a willful disregard for concepts in logic. </p><p>Let's put this into perspective: Any technology can be used for good or ill but we do have a responsibility to address and mitigate any potential misuse. The proportion of illicit transactions in digital assets is actually quite small compared to the overall transaction volumes. </p><p><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">According to Chainalysis</a>, illicit transactions made up only 0.15% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2021, down from 0.62% in 2020. In comparison, <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">according to the UN</a>, it is estimated that annual money laundering amounts to 2% to 5% of global GDP. Furthermore, the Chainalysis report argues that the transparency of blockchain technology allows for better analysis and tracking of illicit activity compared to traditional financial systems. </p><p>So, while we should certainly aim to reduce the amount of illicit activity being fueled by cryptocurrencies, it's crucial to remember that illicit activities are not unique to cryptocurrencies. Consider this quote written <a href="https://cryptoforinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/An-Analysis-of-Bitcoins-Use-in-Illicit-Finance-By-Michael-Morell.pdf">in a report by former CIA Acting Director Michael Morell</a>: </p><p>“The broad generalizations about the use of Bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated. The blockchain ledger on which Bitcoin transactions are recorded is an underutilized forensic tool that can be used more widely by law enforcement and the intelligence community to identify and disrupt illicit activities. Put simply, blockchain analysis is a highly effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.” </p><p>We respect Senator Warren’s office and her commitment to public safety, but we must also speak truth to power, especially when powerful elected officials manipulate statistics for a political agenda. The suggestion that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are primarily tools for illicit trade is absolutely false. It is a misrepresentation that is being used as propaganda to push for tighter regulation and potentially infringe on the freedoms that these decentralized systems provide. </p><h2>Why Attack Bitcoin?</h2><p>Such misconceptions about bitcoin and digital assets suggest a lack of understanding within the government about these innovative technologies. It is concerning when these misinterpretations are used to justify attempts to limit the freedoms that these systems afford. To put it more succinctly, this is a willful mischaracterization of an emerging technology that has the potential to empower individuals and decentralize power away from governments. </p><p>All governments throughout history have abused their authority of coinage and seigniorage, so a free-market tool that threatens that system would clearly be a target. Figures like Senator Warren have been issuing dire warnings about the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit transactions, while calling for greater regulation of the sector. These statements are clearly attempts to exploit the situation to push an anti-decentralization and anti-innovation agenda, resulting in greater government control and limits to the freedoms of individuals. </p><p>Instead, our mission should be to foster understanding and acceptance of this innovative technology, emphasizing the transformative potential and the inherent freedoms that Bitcoin can provide. We should defend the right to freedom and privacy that these decentralized systems protect. As such, we can't stress enough the importance of educating our legislators about bitcoin and digital assets. Accurate understanding is key to developing fair and effective regulation that protects consumers without stifling innovation. It is our responsibility as members of the Bitcoin community to ensure that our voices are heard, our technology is understood and our rights are protected.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Lee Bratcher and Mark Shut.

This move comes after several other major players in the financial industry have also made similar filings, cementing Bitcoin's position as a sought-after asset among traditional investors.</p><p>The momentum began with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">BlackRock</a>, one of the world's largest asset management firms, filing for a spot bitcoin ETF application. Although they were not the first — ARK Investments and 21Shares had already filed for a spot ETF — they initiated the cascading effect now seen. Investment firms <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/blackrock-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-filings">Bitwise</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/invesco-reapplies-for-bitcoin-etf-advocates-for-more-crypto-investment-products/">Invesco</a> both refiled for their own spot ETFs, which they had submitted previously.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/wisdomtree-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf">WisdomTree</a>, an investment management company renowned for its innovative exchange-traded products, filed its own application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Adding to the now-growing list of firms seeking to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs">Valkyrie Investments</a> joined the race. </p><p>Meanwhile, ARK, a prominent investment management firm, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1674055780058771463?s=20">amended</a> its 19b-4 filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF, solidifying its position in the race for approval. With the inclusion of a surveillance sharing agreement between CBOE and a crypto exchange (likely Coinbase), ARK's filing aligns with BlackRock's strategy and places them at the forefront to potentially be approved first, given their early filing.</p><p>However, amidst this competition, Fidelity Investments has reentered the fray by reapplying for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Fidelity, a trusted name in the financial industry, brings its significant expertise and reputation to the bitcoin market, further solidifying the notion that Bitcoin is gaining acceptance among institutional investors.</p><p>Jaymes Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg,<a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1674469367466143745?s=20"> took to Twitter</a> to share his guesses at when the filings may be addressed, noting that the dates for when the filings will be approved or denied are not exact. </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1674469367466143745"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>This series of events serves as a testament to the growing recognition of Bitcoin's potential as a mainstream asset class.

The plebs that make up the group have wide-ranging skill sets across multiple industries, such as education, finance and information technology, in addition to holding blue-collar jobs. This grassroots movement has lofty goals. As early member Mark Maraia stated in an interview for this article, CLOs have embarked on a mission of helping “Lightning rails rule the Earth.”</p><h2>Diagnosing Before Prescribing</h2><p>While Maraia and many others in the group have sales experience, the goal is not about “closing the deal”: Self-appointed members of CLO, who call themselves “chief Lightning officers,” meet local, prospective Lightning point-of-sale (PoS) merchants with a fact-finding mindset: they build relationships with these local merchants and uncover their pain points. While it’s easy for Bitcoiners to say “Bitcoin fixes this,” CLOs attempt to, as Maraia puts it, “diagnose before you prescribe.” </p><p>The biggest frictions discussed by the group have been high fees, delayed settlements, the security of in-house funds, friction during international business transactions and overreaching government regulations. But, as anyone who has studied the Lightning Network enough has realized, it has boundless potential to reduce fees, “lightning” quick final settlement, increased security and privacy, not to mention its ability to be borderless and permissionless.</p><p>The goal of the first few meetings of CLO was to determine which industries were ripe for Lightning adoption. Of the early suggestions were cannabis dispensaries, coffee shops (oh, the irony — paying for coffee with bitcoin), food trucks and non-chain restaurants, local sports teams and craft brewers, to name a few. During each meeting, the group brainstorms other industries that would benefit from utilizing the Lightning payments network (LPN). The group agrees that local Bitcoin meetups should all be working toward having merchants at their meetup spot accept Lightning payments. Some already are, like <a href="https://www.meetup.com/boulder-bitcoiners/">Boulder Bitcoin</a>, which created an LNURL/QR code that funds meetup event items such as drinks and pizza. <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCLincolnLand">Lincolnland Bitcoin</a> is in the process of obtaining the <a href="https://geyser.fund/project/bitcoinlightningatm">World’s Smallest Bitcoin (Lightning) Hobby ATM</a> so that local plebs can convert their spare change into bitcoin.</p><h2>Member Successes</h2><p>One CLO member, <a href="https://twitter.com/midsummer21mil">Holly Young</a>, recently shared <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/onboarding-portugal-to-bitcoin-lightning">her experience hosting a Lightning workshop in Portugal</a> for merchants and local small business owners. Aside from being called a “spammer” and accused of “promoting a Ponzi scheme or profiteering,” Young had a productive experience. Thanks to the help of a tech-savvy family member, attendees of her workship were able to successfully create Coinos accounts. In <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/onboarding-portugal-to-bitcoin-lightning">an article for Bitcoin Magazine</a>, Young described her motivation, “For me personally, the possibility of hooking the vendors up with the Bitcoin community and the Bitcoin community with people producing goods of genuine value is a key driver in organizing events of this kind.” </p><p>Since that workshop, Young has received several requests for similar one-on-one support. She is increasingly assured of Lightning’s potential “as more and more of us devote time and energy to helping it along its natural path to success,” she told me.</p><p>Another CLO member, <a href="https://twitter.com/the_brischster">Ryan Brisch</a>, has had recent success onboarding a local restaurant to accept bitcoin via the Lightning payments network. Brisch, who recently started a business called “Lightning Network Solutions” which helps merchants set up the ability to accept Lightning payments, explained the process in his own words for this article. </p><p>“Thanks to my local Bitcoin group, I learned about a <a href="https://bitcoin-grill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/menu-bitcoingrill.pdf">new restaurant called Bitcoin Grill</a>, but that they weren't yet set up to accept bitcoin payments on chain or via Lightning,” he said. “After having my discussions with a couple business owners, including a restaurateur, I decided to call the restaurant and asked to speak to one of the owners. From there I scheduled a meeting. The first attempt was a dud, the owner had something come up and left me hanging.” </p><p>As any Bitcoiner knows, this is a common problem; most people require multiple touchpoints before being able to grok Bitcoin/Lightning. </p><p>Brisch continued, “After learning their Bitcoin journey, I showed him the IBEX solution. He was blown away by how easy it was to use and asked if he could sign up for it on the spot! So, we walked through the sign-up process and created a couple of BPTs (Bitcoin payment terminals) on a couple of their iPads.” </p><p>From there, Brisch took the time to follow up by training the servers. As previously stated, the goal is not to close the deal but rather to build a relationship with local merchants. Brisch foresees more follow-up training to ensure a smooth transition.</p><p>Another tool in the CLO members’ toolbelts is inviting and interviewing businesses built on Lightning. The CLO members realize that every merchant has needs specific to their situations. Therefore, they don’t prescribe one solution; rather, they stay platform agnostic. The group has so far sought out the expertise of the following: <a href="https://twitter.com/AnalysFalchuk">Analys Falchuk</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ibexpay">IBEXPay</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dooowta">Michael Atwood</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/OshiApp">Oshi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/adamsoltys">Adam Soltys</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/coinoswallet">Coinos</a>. In addition, a large part of meetings discuss the pros and cons of various Lightning infrastructures. And it’s not like there are just a few to sift through (see image below). Of the many options, <a href="https://twitter.com/walletofsatoshi">Wallet of Satoshi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PhoenixWallet">Phoenix</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MuunWallet">Muun</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lightsats21">LightSats</a> and <a href="https://blixtwallet.github.io/">Blixt</a>, as well as payment processors like <a href="https://twitter.com/BtcpayServer">BTCPay Server</a> and plenty of others, have been analyzed.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Maraia believes Lightning adoption will gain traction in 2023. His reasoning is as follow:</p><p>“(There are a) dizzying number of companies that are innovating like crazy. Lightning companies are like Legos. People will use the Lightning payments network without knowing it. The Lightning payments network is the Trojan horse (for bitcoin adoption). (We’re) building a community of problem solvers in payments. Lightning can go places and do things fiat can’t.”</p><p>If you run a Lightning business or you’re a pleb wanting to help further Lightning adoption in your area, consider reaching out to the <a href="https://t.me/+46xTJG4PnEE5NGJh">CLO Telegram group</a>. Find a <a href="https://bitcoin-only.com/meetups">Bitcoin meetup</a> in your area. Locate <a href="https://btcmap.org/">merchants accepting bitcoin and Lightning</a> in your area. Adoption won’t happen on its own. It takes individuals like you and me willing to go the extra mile. </p><p>Like nodes on a network, we are the ones disseminating the boundless benefits of these revolutionary technologies in a peer-to-peer payment system that is soon to cover the globe.

Rather than the energy expenditure necessitated by PoW, PoS requires validators or miners to make contributions to the network from their own holdings of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, i.e., their “stake.”</p><p>To avoid losing their stake, validators are incentivized to operate honestly and reach a consensus on the order and validity of transactions. PoS miners are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold or "stake" in the network; therefore, the more cryptocurrency a validator stakes, the more likely they will be chosen to create the next block. </p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoiners-guide-to-proof-of-stake">Technical Guide To Proof Of Stake</a></p><h2>Comparison With Proof Of Work</h2><p>Instead of stakes, PoW requires considerable computational resources and energy consumption to validate transactions and create new blocks. For this reason, people assume proof of stake is more energy efficient and less resource intensive than PoW. Yet, we will learn later in this article that this is a somewhat false assumption.</p><p>Both consensus mechanisms aim at producing new blocks and validating transactions. They must also maintain the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/proof-of-work-is-objective-proof-of-stake-is-not">security and integrity</a> of the blockchain network, but they do so in different ways.</p><p>In PoW, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining">miners compete</a> to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem faster and reach a consensus on the validity of transactions. The quickest miner to complete the target hash creates a new block and receives the block reward, the network's token of value. By selecting the chain with the most work, the network overcomes any ambiguity, and double spending is prevented due to requiring at least 51% of the global hash power for a double spend block to catch up. </p><p>In <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum’s</a> PoS, by means of comparison, the double-spending problem is solved using “checkpoint blocks” at various points in time, approved by a two-thirds majority vote through a stake to “assure” everyone in the network about the “truth” of the system.</p><p>Another significant difference between PoS and PoW is the incentives and the ethics behind them. In a PoS network, incentives hide a negative (penalty-based) connotation since validators may lose their stake if they act maliciously. This contrasts with PoW, where miners are only incentivized to behave honestly to be rewarded with cryptocurrency through a positive (reward-based) incentive system. </p><p>Bitcoin miners who attempt to break the rules by producing poorly formatted blocks or invalid transactions will find their blocks ignored by full nodes. As a result, they will incur substantial electricity costs. Moreover, they would need to command 51% of the hash power to build upon older blocks; otherwise, these chains will lag behind, leading to even more costly energy waste. </p><p>One of the most heated debates in consensus mechanisms is decentralization and the ability to maintain this decentralization. PoW decentralization is secured by an active network of full nodes, in addition to miners, a vital feature that isn’t reflected in PoS consensus mechanisms. The importance of nodes in PoW was marked in the blocksize war of 2017 when the small block supporters won the battle against big blockers by starting the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-independence-day-how-this-watershed-day-defines-community-consensus">user-activated soft fork (UASF) movement</a> and voting for the BTC chain instead of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). That historic Bitcoin event emphasized how nodes could win against big corporations and that miners do not control the network, unlike PoS validators.</p><h2>How Proof Of Stake Works</h2><p>In a proof-of-stake network, participants can be miners or validators who verify and authenticate transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency they hold or "stake" in the network. </p><p>Validators are randomly selected to add the following block based on their stake; the more cryptocurrency a validator has staked, the more likely they will be chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks.</p><p>When a validator is chosen to create a new block, they need to validate all the transactions in the block and add them to the blockchain. To validate the transactions, the validator must check that they are valid, are not “double spending,” and that the sender has enough cryptocurrency to make the transaction.</p><p>Once all transactions are validated in the block, a new block is created and added to the blockchain. At that point, the successful validator is rewarded with native tokens for their work.</p><p>In a proof-of-stake network, consensus is achieved when most validators agree on the state of the blockchain. If a validator creates a block that is not accepted by the majority of validators, the block is rejected, and the validator may lose their staked cryptocurrency.</p><h2>Valid Criticisms Of Proof Of Stake</h2><p>Although proof of stake is often perceived as more energy efficient and less resource demanding when compared to proof of work, these assumptions can be easily refuted, showing that decentralization and security are compromised with proof of stake and that PoS is a mirror image of the current monetary system, which is known to be particularly energy inefficient, as well as unfair to the majority of participants. </p><p>One key argument against the perceived advantages of proof of stake is the concentration of wealth and power this can lead to. In a PoS system, validators with more stake (or wealth) have a higher probability of being chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks. This results in a rich-get-richer scenario, where the wealthiest validators gain even more control and influence over the network. The table below from Nansen Research provides a clear picture of the staking landscape within the Ethereum proof-of-stake system.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This concentration of power contradicts the principles of decentralization, as a small number of validators can potentially dominate decision-making processes. Unlike proof of work, where miners have to invest in computational power, proof of stake allows validators to accumulate wealth and control the network based on their initial stake, rather than their ongoing contributions to the system.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Another valid criticism of proof of stake is the pre-mine configurations many cryptocurrencies, including ether (ETH), are based on. Mining tokens before their public launch means that founders, stakeholders, and developers may access a lot of wealth and have a considerable advantage over any other investors or validators who later join the network. While such a design could also apply to proof-of-work blockchains, it is more often used in the proof-of-stake ecosystems, because in such systems, it’s possible to have a greater share of the validation process, due to the absence of nodes.</p><p>Common critiques of the PoS consensus mechanism:</p><ul><li>Lack of decentralization: validators who hold a large amount of cryptocurrency have a higher chance of being selected to create new blocks, receive rewards, and they have more influence over the network, leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few validators. This could lead to a situation where a small group of validators controls the network and its rules, potentially compromising its security and decentralization and reinforcing existing wealth inequalities. </li><li>The validation process can be manipulated: since the network could be manipulated by owning 51% of the tokens in circulation, it is easier to influence the transaction validation than with a 51% attack on PoW, which requires controlling 51% of a network’s current computational power.</li><li>Security: in PoS, the network's safety depends on the amount of cryptocurrency held by validators, making it more vulnerable to attacks if a large number of validators were to collude.</li><li>Complexity: there are various types of proof of stake, such as delegated PoS (DPOS), leased PoS (LPOS), pure PoS (PPOS), and other hybrid types. These are all variants of an overengineered system, which is difficult for anyone to truly explain and understand. The more complex a system is, the more likely it is to fail.</li><li>Environmental impact: proof of stake (PoS) is often criticized for its environmental impact, mirroring the concerns associated with the existing monetary system. Unlike proof of work (PoW), which <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">incentivizes the expenditure of energy</a>, PoS systems are considered less energy intensive. However, the proliferation of blockchains relying on inefficient PoS mechanisms collectively exacerbates their environmental footprint.</li><li>Nothing-at-stake problem: the nothing-at-stake problem is a theoretical weakness in PoS, where validators have little to lose by creating multiple versions of the blockchain. In a PoS network, validators could create multiple versions of the blockchain, hoping that one version will become the "correct" version. This could lead to a situation where the network is unable to reach a consensus, compromising its security.</li><li>Difficulty in determining the right amount to stake: determining the optimal amount of cryptocurrency to stake in a PoS network is challenging. Validators must balance the desire for higher rewards with the risk of losing their stake.</li></ul><h2>Would Bitcoin Ever Move To Proof Of Stake? </h2><p>Ethereum’s recent shift from PoW to PoS in September 2022 sparked ideas across the corporatized environmental world that Bitcoin should do the same and therefore abandon the “extreme energy consumption” required by its consensus mechanism. </p><p>Changing Ethereum to a PoS system <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">won’t/didn’t reduce energy consumption by 99.95%</a>, as it fails to take into account that expensive enterprise farms and corporations use enormous amounts of energy to subsidize the work necessary to complete PoS transactions globally.</p><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/greenpeace-seeks-to-change-bitcoin-code">Greenpeace “Change the Code” campaign</a> funded by Ripple Labs to discredit the energy usage of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system is a typical example of how the corporate world does not encourage change and, instead, promotes the perpetration of an elitist system that is now fully mirrored in Ethereum’s consensus mechanism.</p><p>Besides proposing a new revolutionary and fair monetary system, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-energy-revolution-happening-now">PoW fosters renewable energy innovation</a> and the use of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/profiting-on-biogas-with-bitcoin-mining">stranded and wasted energy</a> which will benefit the environment more than a supposedly energy-efficient PoS system in the long term. Proof of stake is merely better at concealing the energy purchases made by the corporations that enable its validating mechanism.</p><p>Thankfully, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-will-never-change-to-proof-of-stake">Bitcoin’s code is highly resistant</a> to these types of attacks and was purposely developed this way. It is improbable that a proposal to change the code would even pass any initial stage of consideration by the developers, let alone the community. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In free markets, it is important to allow both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms to coexist and evolve in ways that are profitable and beneficial to their respective supporters. Bitcoin, as an innovative monetary system, not only brings about technological advancements but also strives to have a positive impact on the environment. Educating individuals about the significance of PoW in this transformative process is a responsibility that Bitcoin enthusiasts understand and embrace.</p><p>If you're concerned about wealth protection, financial inclusion, and fostering a better environment for all life on earth, the ideal choice is a currency that is borderless, permissionless and embodies pristine hard money and freedom technology.</p><p>This type of money, which is impervious to censorship and safe from confiscation, highlights the superiority of proof of work over proof of stake. In years to come, Bitcoin may likely be the only token of value, and the decision to support proof of work will be seen as obvious in hindsight.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4OTkwMTMzMjgwNjQ2OTI5/proof-of-stake-feature-image-w-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTkwMTA0ODI2NDg4Nzg4/unnamed.png" height="302" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTkwMTIyODExNjY0MzQw/unnamed-1.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MicroStrategy's Aggressive Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Secures 0.726% of Total Supply]]></title><description><![CDATA[MicroStrategy continues to dominate the corporate bitcoin space with an aggressive acquisition strategy.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategys-secures-0-726-of-total-bitcoin-supply-with-latest-buy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategys-secures-0-726-of-total-bitcoin-supply-with-latest-buy</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[michael saylor]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin treasuries]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[microstrategy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 17:02:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>MicroStrategy, the leading public corporation in terms of bitcoin holdings, has once again demonstrated its aggressive bitcoin acquisition strategy. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 12,333 BTC for approximately $347.0 million, at an average price of $28,136 per bitcoin. This brings MicroStrategy's total holdings to an impressive 152,333 BTC, acquired at an average price of $29,668 per bitcoin. With a total of 21 million bitcoins set to ever exist, MicroStrategy now controls approximately 0.726% of the total available supply.</p><p>This latest move by MicroStrategy further solidifies its position as the largest public corporation holder of bitcoin. MicroStrategy's journey with bitcoin began in August 2020, and despite <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-buys-2500-btc-despite-sale">selling some of its holdings</a> for tax loss harvesting in December 2022, the company has consistently increased its bitcoin collection. In fact, shortly after the sale, MicroStrategy acquired an additional 2,500 bitcoin, further bolstering its already significant holdings. With their current holdings, MicroStrategy now controls approximately 0.726% of the total 21 million bitcoins that will ever be mined.</p><p>In addition to its relentless accumulation of bitcoin, MicroStrategy has recently revealed plans to leverage <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-launch-bitcoin-lightning-apps-2023">Lightning</a> for enterprise infrastructure services and content monetization solutions.

Any Bitcoiner who's done the research knows that bitcoin the asset is radically undervalued. And I wholeheartedly agree! But even though bitcoin, the asset, is undervalued, it pales in comparison to how much the Bitcoin network is undervalued. I have long held that Bitcoiners, as a group, are undervaluing the Bitcoin network as much or more than no coiners are undervaluing bitcoin the asset.</p><p>So, it is with some amusement that I observe the fierce debate between the Bitcoin purists who believe that the use of the Bitcoin network (i.e., the immutable digital ledger) is <em>only</em> for sending value (bitcoin), and the inscriptions, Ordinals and BRC token crowd which says and does otherwise.</p><p>In my opinion, what most Bitcoin purists are missing is the difference between bitcoin the asset and the immutable digital ledger, also called “the timechain.” The highest and best use for the immutable ledger is holding and sending value, but it is <em>not</em> the only use, as inscriptions and BRC tokens are showing us. </p><p>In addition, I’ve always thought of the network and protocol (the immutable digital ledger) as a place where I can post a message <em>that cannot be changed</em>. Hence, when the <a href="https://declarationofmonetaryindependence.org/">Declaration Of Monetary Independence</a> (DoMI) was first published on October 31, 2021, I had a fellow Bitcoiner make permanent note of it in the timechain. </p><p>I believe it can be found at block height 707,575. And when we created the 2023 version of DoMI that people signed in Miami at the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/declaration-of-monetary-independence-to-reappear-at-bitcoin-2023">Bitcoin 2023 event</a>, I had another Bitcoiner create an inscription for it. Both can now be found on the immutable ledger. I totally understand why many want to use the timechain only for money, but I consider it naive to think it will only be used for that purpose. </p><h2>One Man’s Nonsense Is Another Man’s Meaning</h2><p>Where I get worked up is in how little the market (<em>all of us</em>) values the timechain. In my opinion, there isn’t a single person on the planet who values the network properly… yet. </p><p>What inscriptions and BRC tokens do is increase the perceived value of the timechain. Overall, that’s a plus. Until the network is valued at 250 sats per $1, it’s <em>insanely</em> underpriced!</p><p>Even in the era of inscriptions and BRC tokens, the immutable ledger is still <em>radically</em> undervalued and the cost for putting data on it is way below where an intelligent market will put it. </p><p>It’s as if Satoshi Nakamoto invented two things: One, a new kind of scarce digital money <em>and</em> two, an immutable ledger to keep track of every satoshi. Using a metaphor to make the point, he/she/they invented a new kind of railcar <em>and</em> the tracks the railcar runs on. </p><p>We silly human beings, who are slavishly obsessed with money, give 99.9% of our attention to the asset and almost none to the network (i.e., the timechain) even though the network is as mind blowing as the asset. More impressively and often ignored is this: Nakamoto had to invent a new way to keep time in order to allow the immutable ledger to remain decentralized. Do we celebrate, applaud and value this new method of keeping time? Not really. As of this writing, at block height 794,076, we still just assume and take for granted that this new timekeeping method will keep working for decades. Tick tock, next block. </p><p>We all need to be a bit more humble and, I dare say, reverent about this immutable ledger and appreciate that some people will “waste” block space putting stuff in the timechain that will endure as long as it keeps ticking. Who am I to tell another how to value it? <em>Today, every single Bitcoiner undervalues and underpays for the use of this immutable digital ledger.</em></p><p>Consider this carving into a 300-year-old, majestic oak tree: “Satoshi loves the timechain.” </p><p>To those who love majestic oak trees, such an inscription might be seen as vandalism or horrific. To the person who did the carving, it might represent a labor of love to have inscribed that message into the tree. The tree doesn’t care, only people do. </p><p>Rather than waste any more human energy arguing about inscriptions and Ordinals, I’m going to take my cue from Bitcoin’s timechain. The timechain is absolutely neutral about how we humans make use of it in the same way that the tree does not care what carvings you make into its trunk.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mark Maraia.

The Division cited concerns about Prime Trust's unsafe and unsound operations as well as its insolvency. This move follows a Cease-and-Desist Order issued on June 21, 2023.</p><p>The court petition revealed that the company owes more than $82 million in fiat cash, and that the company lost access to what it describes as “legacy” wallets holding cryptocurrency in 2021. </p><p>The petition states:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"In January 2021, PRIME reintroduced specific legacy wallet forwarding addresses to customers (“Legacy Wallets”). It is understood PRIME did so because of limitations associated with creating new wallets within the Fireblocks platform. PRIME purportedly believed that these legacy wallets existed on the Fireblocks platform or were configured to forward to wallets accessible on the Fireblocks platform. However, it is understood that on or about December 2021, PRIME discovered that it was unable to access the Legacy Wallets and the cryptocurrency therein. It is understood that from December 2021 to March 2022, to satisfy the withdrawals from the inaccessible Legacy Wallets, PRIME purchased additional digital currency using customer money from its omnibus customer accounts. PRIME is reported to have been making efforts to regain access to the Legacy Wallets. However, as of the date of this Petition, PRIME has been unable to do so.”</p></blockquote><p>On top of this previously unknown blunder, the petition detailed the “unsafe” financial state of the firm, saying:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“In addition to the above, it is reported that the frequency of customer withdrawals from PRIME have recently increased. Furthermore, many of the withdrawals were for large sums. As such, at or about the time of the instant Petition, it is understood that PRIME’s financial status is such that it owes, in fiat currency, $85,670,000 to its clients but has $2,904,000 in fiat currency (equaling an $82,766,000 fiat currency liability).

Vishal, who previously worked for a financial regulator in Abu Dhabi, explained that MiCA is a comprehensive set of regulations for cryptocurrencies that treats them as financial services. He highlighted that MiCA brings uniformity to the registration and anti-money laundering requirements for crypto asset service providers across Europe, allowing for passporting of licenses throughout the region.</p><p>When asked about the impact of MiCA on Bitcoin specifically, Vishal stated that MiCA does not differentiate between different cryptocurrencies and treats them all equally. He mentioned that while MiCA is not the first regulatory framework in the world, it is the first in Europe and similar to what the UK is doing with its regulation.</p><p>Regarding the implications for companies operating as crypto asset service providers (CASP), Vishal explained that they will be regulated based on the services they provide rather than the underlying asset class. “...your cap requirements, your risk mitigations, everything is around the services that you're doing.” Different services such as custody, trading platforms and advice will have specific requirements and risk mitigations.</p><p>Vishal also mentioned that the MiCA regulation will have varying requirements based on the size of the service providers. Larger providers will have more capital and governance controls to ensure consumer protection. He noted that there is still more to come in terms of guidelines for marketing and treatment of stablecoins and NFTs, remarking that “There will probably be separate tools developed for them in the future, but not yet.” </p><p>When asked about the regulatory environment in Europe compared to the U.S., Vishal emphasized that regulators often need time to catch up with innovation, and the power of innovation drives the industry. He believes that Europe's crypto-friendly regulations have been attracting firms and he expects more players to set up shop in the region. “It's just a matter of time before you see a lot more of these players and new startups coming up with new, more innovative products or services,” Vishal stated.</p><p>In terms of the global impact of MiCA, Vishal suggested that other regions may adopt similar regulatory stances or incorporate aspects of MiCA into their own legislation. However, he noted that growing the talent pool within the industry is also crucial for its development.</p><p>For everyday cryptocurrency users, Vishal emphasized that they need to understand that industry firms are now treated as financial service providers under MiCA. He also highlighted the importance of the ability to passport licenses and serve the wider European market from a single center.</p><p>Overall, the MiCA regulation in Europe aims to provide a comprehensive framework for regulating crypto assets as financial services, bringing uniformity and consumer protection to the industry. While some aspects are still under development, MiCA is set to become law by the end of next year, with potential implications for the global industry.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNTY1MTQ0NDExNjEyODM1/ac-btc.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Things Are Brewing In Prague]]></title><description><![CDATA[At BTC Prague, techno ambiance permeated, meandering paths collided and a rockstar moment stole the show.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-conference-summary-from-btc-prague</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-conference-summary-from-btc-prague</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Prague]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Conference]]></category><category><![CDATA[michael saylor]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Joakim Book]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Joakim Book, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research and contributor to HumanProgress.org and the Mises Institute.</em></p><p>The first thing that met attendees when entering the venue at BTC Prague’s inaugural conference was the smell: a strong, new-rubber-type of scent that permeated most of the main stage area. The second was the light — or the absence thereof: it was dark, with massive screens at regular intervals and neon lights shining elegantly across the ceiling. </p><p>What likely remains etched into participants’ memories is the dim, purple haze and those comfy, white VIP sofas in the front (paying up for VIP tickets has its perks!). A large BTC logo and slowly bobbing lamps hanging above the panelists on the main stage brought a spooky, somewhat nauseous feel — like the whole stage was slowly twirling. As if I weren’t already lightheaded from my travels, endless conversations and lack of sleep that I wholeheartedly blame on the many pre-, side- and after-events going on in Prague’s thriving nightlife.</p><p>As I took it all in, I pulled out my notepad and scribbled, “The techno raves of my teenage years called and want their ambience back.” </p><p>For the first few sessions of all three days, it was empty in the main hall. Eerie, even. <em>Where is everybody?</em></p><h2>Meandering Paths</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsQPHcX8WyM&amp;ab_channel=Trezor">expo hall</a> seemed to be where most of the cool kids hung out; the rest perhaps basking in the morning sun along the river in downtown Prague. </p><p>Littered with hundreds of Bitcoin companies and thousands of participants, the expo hall was dominated by a two-story centerpiece booth occupied by SatoshiLabs. It reached out, symbolically, into the four corners of the space with each section dedicated to its four business brands, one of which, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index">Vexl Foundation’s KYC-free, peer-to-peer bitcoin app</a>, launched during the conference. Around it, lining the edges of the football-field-sized hall were miners, hardware wallet makers, a dozen or so different backup-on-steel products, book publishers and plenty of merch and consumables. There were so many booths hidden behind something else, in fact, that after several walkthroughs I <em>still</em> found new companies or conference booths I hadn’t noticed before. I live and breathe the Bitcoin space and yet I didn’t know half of these companies or their products: Bitcoiners truly are prolific, new products and companies popping up like mushrooms after the rain (to anglicize a <a href="https://english.radio.cz/theyre-springing-mushrooms-after-rain-8598408#:~:text=The%20phrase%20to%20listen%20out,like%20mushrooms%20after%20the%20rain%E2%80%9D.">Czech saying</a>). </p><p>The official language of the conference, by the way, was broken English of that comical and vaguely European kind; it was a nice change from the avalanche of Americanesque that otherwise <a href="https://youtu.be/WZ6Rl46k-HU?t=41">dominates the Bitcoin space</a> and Bitcoin conferences. </p><p>What was not different about this event was that the audience mostly consisted of pretty fit dudes in the primes of their lives. Some brought their wives and kids, too, giving the venue a somewhat family-friendly vibe. It’s palatable that self-responsibility in money also translates into self-responsibility in other domains. In the age of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dr-jordan-peterson-bitcoin-2022-blessing">Jordan Peterson</a>, Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro, it’s not too surprising that this message resonates most powerfully with young(-ish) men. </p><p>Somewhere between the venue and the stop at the end of the red metro line went a clear transition from the fiat world to the Bitcoin world. As I traveled toward the conference each day, I started seeing colorful wristbands, Bitcoin-themed clothing and the kind of fit, confident and extravagant clientele that outs us as Bitcoiners. Upon entering the venue, I switched out my Google Pay for a Lightning wallet app since absolutely everyone accepted Lightning. Once in a while, a merchant politely asked if I wished to pay with card or Lightning, but most of the time, they just presented me with an invoice. Exchange of monetary energy can be precisely this simple; never does the difference between the Bitcoin world and the outside world feel more pronounced. </p><p>The coffee barista at the grand El Salvador booth diligently made the conference’s best coffee, all day, every day — for anyone with the patience to stand around and watch him carefully brew it, anyway. Then again, if you wanted to <em>buy </em>coffee from one of the food trucks outside, have fun staying in line for 20 minutes. But the food was great, as were the benches and beanbags for socializing and soaking in the Prague summer heat — until the humid summer cascades shoved the thousands of participants inside, crowding everything into festival-like proportions. </p><p>Among the many impromptu meetings and reunions, scheduled or happenstance, some stood out: the selfie with an idol, thanking a podcaster or author for their valuable work, connecting in real life with personas or nyms that before were nothing but words, voices or profile pics. </p><p>In the middle of the expo hall, I suddenly felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around to see a tall, slick, dark-haired man about my age. The face was familiar — <em>very</em> familiar — but from another time, another place. <em>“Do you remember me?”</em> My brain worked like an overclocked ASIC to find the solution to this cryptographic puzzle; in the five-second block time expected for this sort of interaction, I couldn’t quite do it. He reminded me that we studied economics together at university in what felt like a lifetime ago; we were on the same study abroad program to the same city but hadn’t kept in touch since. He returned there for a few years after we graduated but was now back in his native Prague. He told me that he finds the money broken, the runaway prices absurd. He’s a new arrival to Bitcoin, having won his ticket to the conference at his first Bitcoin event just a few months back. </p><p>“I’m learning so much,” he said. </p><p>Two meandering paths, united by Bitcoin: Everyone comes here eventually, in their own way, at their own time. It’s a beautiful thing. </p><h2>The Rockstar Moment</h2><p>For the oversized main stage to be filled up, we would have to wait for Michael Saylor’s two appearances. Saylor, who’s rapidly approaching rockstar status in the Bitcoin world, gave an absolutely mesmerizing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mhu6dxj7qk&amp;ab_channel=BTCPrague">keynote speech</a> on the third day, but the hall had also been clogged up for a fireside chat he had with <a href="https://twitter.com/Eric_BIGfund/status/1667220927204020224">Eric Weiss</a> the day before. The overflowing room that had echoed somewhat empty for many previous sessions was now so littered with spectators that the air conditioners running at max capacity couldn’t keep up. As his characteristic “Bitc-<em>oing</em>” echoed across the hall, Saylor’s talk literally took our breath away. </p><p>Bitcoin is an ethically good thing, it’s a moral imperative, he pointed out. Bitcoin and Bitcoiners carry a superior ideology that we “don’t have to apologize for.”</p><p>The tour de force that was the keynote lecture dealt with the U.S. dollar’s collapse against hard assets. That’s not a revolutionary notion in these circles, but the way Saylor packaged the message might be: By holding cash, you’re “on the wrong side of an economic war.”</p><blockquote><p>“There’s an endless economic war raging worldwide and it’s been raging since the beginning of time and it’s going on right now. That war is over the redistribution of economic energy, and we call that <em>wealth</em>…</p><p>“No amount of hard work is going to solve the problem of being on the wrong side of that economic war.”</p></blockquote><p>Technology is an order of magnitude more important than hard work; it doesn’t matter how hard you dig or how good you are with a shovel when the next guy shows up with an excavator. What Saylor added is that <em>government policy</em> is an order of magnitude more important than technology. On a decadal or centennial timeframe, the gains from technology — always in competition with the next thing that makes it obsolete — are siphoned away, drowning under the never-ending money expansion at the root of society’s many troubles. </p><p>The energy in the room was as fever-pitched as during the “Satoshi Rockamoto” concert the night before. The uncomfortable realization began to shine through: “Maybe your work doesn’t matter as much as government policy.” I can’t outwork the pernicious effects of a crumbling money inflating away my economic contributions. </p><p>The conclusion, blatantly obvious to most participants, is that you need to exit — physically as well as monetarily. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/erik-dale">Erik Dale</a>, the Norwegian influencer and podcast host of “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6ZfuSe6OyxCSKK12qitC6m">Bitcoin For Breakfast</a>,” told us as much in his <a href="https://twitter.com/EuroDale/status/1668194678372458496">opening lecture</a> the day before: The week of the conference, “might have been the first time we have seen net immigration of Bitcoiners <em>to</em> Europe,” he said. Usually, we Europeans just take our “FU money” and exit our crumbling museum of bureaucrats and overburdened, public Ponzi schemes. </p><p>But perhaps we overlooked the Bitcoin hub that is Prague — home to <a href="https://satoshilabs.com/reach-out">SatoshiLabs</a>, to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/braiins">Braiins</a>, to a <a href="https://www.generalbytes.com/en/contact-us">company behind Bitcoin ATMs</a>. Martin Kuchař, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-kuchar/?originalSubdomain=cz">the co-founder of the conference</a>, kept praising the Czech Bitcoin scene every chance he got: “I see BTC Prague as another Czech project that confirms the importance of the Czech Republic for Bitcoin,” he said in a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/legendary-investor-michael-saylor-speak-130300777.html">pre-conference interview</a>.</p><p>Things are indeed brewing in Prague. Perhaps not all is lost for Europe.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Joakim Book.

This development marks a notable shift in the stance of traditional banks towards bitcoin, as HSBC has previously been cautious in embracing it.</p><p>Reporting by CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/hong-kongs-hsbc-allows-customers-to-trade-bitcoin-ether-etfs-but-thats-not-really-news/">highlighted</a> that HSBC's decision to enable bitcoin ETF trading for its customers comes after several prior developments that saw other banks also allow such activity. Notably, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/samsung-launches-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong">Samsung Asset Management launched</a> the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prior to that, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/hong-kong-bitcoin-etf-receives-53-million">CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF</a> launched on the same platform, receiving approximately $53 million in initial investments. </p><p>The decision by HSBC to allow its customers to trade bitcoin ETFs comes amidst a surge of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs">institutional interest</a> in bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., potentially igniting a race between countries to attract capital with these products. </p><p>The developments are also indicative of the evolving attitudes towards bitcoin among financial institutions. As traditional banks begin to embrace bitcoin, it signals a potential shift towards wider adoption and integration of bitcoin into the mainstream financial system. The merits of this are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/apocalypse-fednow">debatable</a>, but on the surface, that appears to be what these moves signify.<br><br>ETFs are popular investment vehicles, and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs would open up new opportunities for institutional investors to participate in the bitcoin market within a regulated framework. While this comes at the cost of many of the inherent properties that make bitcoin valuable, institutions prefer the rails of regulation and are more likely to be trusting of firms like BlackRock. There are, of course, exceptions to this such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-purchases-6455-btc-pays-off-205m-loan">MicroStrategy</a>, a company that holds its own bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzOTk5NDg5MTkzODEzNTA5/bitcoin-domino.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MicroBT Brings ASIC Manufacturing To America In Partnership With Riot Platforms]]></title><description><![CDATA[One of the largest Bitcoin miner producers has partnered with America’s largest mining firm to bring ASIC production onshore.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microbt-brings-asic-manufacturing-to-america-in-partnership-with-riot-platforms</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microbt-brings-asic-manufacturing-to-america-in-partnership-with-riot-platforms</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Asics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Riot Platforms]]></category><category><![CDATA[whatsminer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[MicroBT]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 13:47:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxOTg3NjIy/img_4431.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="http://bitcoin/">Riot Platforms</a>, the largest public U.S. Bitcoin mining company in terms of developed capacity, has made a groundbreaking announcement regarding a partnership with Bitcoin ASIC manufacturer, <a href="https://www.microbt.com/#/">MicroBT</a>. The two major bitcoin companies will bring the production of MicroBT’s ASICs to America. The collaboration aims to secure miners for Riot's Corsicana facility, significantly boosting the company's mining capabilities. According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, this development comes as Riot's Corsicana facility is set to increase the company's developed capacity to 1.6 GW.</p><p>“This agreement directly repudiates every major criticism of our industry,” the press release stated. “For those concerned about our energy consumption, these machines will be more efficient than ever … For those who say Bitcoin mining data centers do not actually create jobs, we are helping to create hundreds of jobs, between the MicroBT manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, and our state of the art data center coming to Corsicana, Texas.” </p><p>One of the key highlights of this partnership is the expected increase in Riot's self-mining hash rate capacity. The press release states that by mid-2024, upon the full installation of the machines from this order, Riot's self-mining hash rate capacity is projected to surge by approximately 61% to over 20 EH/s. This significant boost in capacity further establishes Riot's position as a leading player in the Bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>Moreover, this partnership between Riot and MicroBT also marks a pivotal moment for the industry. Bitcoin miner manufacturing has traditionally been concentrated in Asia, but this new partnership with Riot strengthens the domestic supply chain in the United States. It expands the options available to Bitcoin miners, offering them a robust selection of machines.</p><p>Importantly, the collaboration between Riot and MicroBT will not only have a positive impact on the industry but also on local job creation. The machines will be manufactured by MicroBT at a new facility in the United States, generating employment opportunities in the local area.</p><p>Riot's partnership with MicroBT signifies a major milestone within the Bitcoin mining industry. With the increased hash rate, domestic manufacturing and job creation, this collaboration is set to shape the future of Bitcoin mining in the United States and contribute to the growth of the industry as a whole.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxOTg3NjIy/img_4431.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[BTC Prague And The Value Of In-Person Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[The BTC Prague event showcased the importance of live Bitcoin education, connections and celebration.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/btc-prague-demonstrated-the-value-of-bitcoin-events</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/btc-prague-demonstrated-the-value-of-bitcoin-events</guid><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Prague]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Conference]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marek Feder]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTky/bitcoin-adoption-map.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Marek Feder, the editor in chief of Investro and a Bitcoin journalist who recently attended the BTC Prague event.</em></p><p>Let’s start with a disclaimer: I am not associated with the organizers of BTC Prague in any way, so in this article, I only provide my personal experience and views as an attendee. And one more disclaimer: I have not been to many Bitcoin conferences, so my takes and impressions from BTC Prague might be old news for some of you. However, I do believe that it was the first “huge” Bitcoin conference not only for myself, but also for countless others from Central Europe, so it might be nice to sum up the whole experience. </p><h2>A Conference Literally For Anyone</h2><p>The fact that the cheapest ticket to BTC Prague was only <a href="https://blockdyor.com/btc-prague/">9 euro</a> (about $11) means that this conference was literally for anyone. There were obviously some limitations to this access, but the cheapest ticket got people to the exposition area as well as to two stages, which was definitely well worth it. This was probably one of the nicest touches by the organizers, as they made this conference available for masses, even outside of Bitcoin. </p><p>This was further enhanced by the fact that the programming on the “Czech Stage” was entirely about Bitcoin basics. It contained talks about what money is; introductions to Bitcoin, privacy and self-custody; explanation of the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum; and much more. </p><p>For two days, newcomers to the Bitcoin world could have listened to some of Bitcoin’s finest from the Czech Republic and Slovakia and receive educations equal to those gained from studying for hundreds of hours. I believe this highlights the importance of in-person conferences and affordable events that can help with orange pilling the mainstream. </p><h2>Industry Day Rulez!</h2><p>While the main conference presented on the Czech Stage and programming for Bitcoin beginners took part on <a href="https://www.btcprague.com/program/">June 9 and June 10</a>, the industry day content focused on businesses started on June 8, and I believe this was the best day for making connections and new friends. </p><p>First of all, during the day, there were “only” two stages with talks and keynotes (the Czech Stage was not open at that time), meaning that there was less of an official program. This allowed people to spend more time in the well-thought-out and inspiring exposition area, where they could find dozens and dozens of companies and Bitcoin organizations.<a href="https://www.btctimes.com/news/three-booths-at-btc-prague-2023-that-benefit-all-bitcoiners"> With more than 70 stalls and booths</a>, attendees had a chance to talk to mining businesses, wallet providers, Bitcoin book shops, education organizations and countless other Bitcoin-related businesses. </p><p>And since the expo area was not as crowded on industry day, it provided the best chance for attendees to have in-depth conversations with all of the attending businesses. Having spent much of the first day in the expo area, I was really surprised by not only the openness and friendliness of all the participants, but also their willingness to have very thorough and informative discussions with anyone who was willing to listen and ask questions. </p><h2>A Top-Notch Program </h2><p>Michael Saylor, Adam Back, Eric Weiss, Giacomo Zucco, Stephan Livera, Marek “Slush” Palatinus, Ben Perrin, Peter McCormack, Rockstar Dev and many, many others <a href="https://www.btcprague.com/speakers/">spoke at the event</a>. The BTC Prague conference had an incredible lineup with Bitcoin experts, developers, entrepreneurs, influencers and business people flying from literally all across the globe. The keynotes, discussion panels and talks were incredible. </p><p>As of this writing, the recordings for only two of the on-stage presentations have been released on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BTCPrague"> official YouTube channel</a>. However, both of them are well worth a watch. Saylor’s “The Future Of Bitcoin” and Zucco’s “Ordinals Are Retarded,” for instance, filled the main hall to the last seat as people listened to these inspiring and educational keynotes. I highly recommend watching both of them.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Mhu6dxj7qk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>The talks also included some<a href="https://www.investro.com/most-important-bitcoin-related-announcements-from-btcprague"> interesting announcements</a> from the speakers, but detailing what was announced would probably take up a whole article alone. Nevertheless, the announcements by<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index"> Vexl Foundation</a>, AmityAge, Fedimint and Aleks Svetski are worth looking into in particular</p><h2>A Plethora Of Fascinating Side Events </h2><p>Before the conference, some of my Bitcoin friends had mentioned that the most important parts would be the expo area and side events. As weird as that may sound, I now understand why they felt that way. While I was not able to personally attend all of the side events, I heard only the best feedback and opinions about the likes of “<a href="https://www.btcprague.com/dev-hack-day/">dev/hack/day</a>,” a Nostr meetup and other events. </p><p>If the attendees really wanted to enjoy the talks and keynotes, and thus did not spend a lot of time in the expo area, the side events were an ideal chance for talking to people in a less formal way. From my observation, the vast majority of the employees from the conference stalls and booths were out and meeting with people even during the side events, giving the attendees a chance to talk with them in a more relaxed manner. Often, this was accompanied by a pint of renowned Czech beer at a restaurant serving homemade specialties of the local cuisine, making it even more pleasant. </p><h2>Room For Improvement</h2><p>Well, there is not much that I would have changed or that I believe is necessary to improve to make this event even more spectacular. However, one minor improvement might have led to even more satisfaction from attendees, yet, it was not related to the program, speakers or booths:</p><p>The food trucks were a source of friction that might be improved in the next event. At times, extremely long queues meant that people were waiting for their food for way longer than they should have, which could cost them precious time in such a tightly-packed conference schedule. </p><p>Additionally, while Lightning Network payments were available in all of the possible food court areas, with the exception of common areas of the hall, where I assume it was just not possible to accept Lightning payments, the food trucks often battled with this payment option.</p><p>I witnessed several problems with accepting Lightning as a payment method for food or drinks myself. Whether that was due to internet connection, problems with the operations of point-of-sale devices or mobile wallets, or just the pure frown on the face of a food vendor who was obviously tired of yet another “Bitcoin freak” paying with this internet money, the whole payment-in-Lightning experience could have been improved. </p><p>Obviously, this was not a big deal and I can hardly imagine a conference of this size being completely without flaws. And it should be noted that Lightning payments were available, if the vendors and buyers showed a bit of patience. </p><p>All in all, this was not critical to the overall feeling and outcome of the conference, but should the organizers strive for improvement for the next year, I would probably start here. </p><h2>Will You Attend BTC Prague 2024? </h2><p>And, speaking of next year, the organizers have officially announced that the<a href="https://www.btcprague.com/"> second BTC Prague conference</a> will take place, unsurprisingly, in Prague, between June 13 and June 15, 2024. If the level of the next year’s conference should be anywhere near the event I attended, it will be a blast for sure.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Marek Feder.

However, time is scarce, so we can't talk to everyone. But what if you could multiply your efforts and help someone close to you benefit from Bitcoin in the process? If you're looking for an orange-pilling opportunity with the most asymmetric upside, consider talking about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network with your barber or stylist.</p><h2>The Perfect Environment</h2><p>Once you sit down in the chair and that cape goes around your neck, you know you’re both going to be there for a while. As a Bitcoiner, that can only mean one thing: You have been given the gift of time to talk about Bitcoin.</p><p>Few routine interactions last as long as a haircut or salon appointment. Even fewer grant you the freedom to discuss any topic of your choosing. Additionally, the setting naturally limits distractions, such as phone usage. That makes the time you spend in your barber's or stylist's chair the perfect environment to talk about Bitcoin.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>A Trusted Relationship</h2><p>How long have you been with your current barber or stylist? Relationships between clients and stylists often span years, if not decades. There is a bond between you that is rooted in trust, and this connection fosters a level of intimacy rarely found outside of familial settings. People often share secrets with their stylists and barbers that they wouldn't disclose to anyone else. Clairol's iconic ad campaign captured this sentiment with the tagline, "Only her hairdresser knows for sure."</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>A Force Multiplier</h2><p>Your barber or stylist likely has the broadest network of anyone you know. People from every walk of life, including business owners, accountants, teachers, firefighters and politicians, sit in their chairs, sometimes for hours. It is likely that no one else in your sphere of influence has the amount of time and trust to help others learn about and understand Bitcoin. The same unique factors that create the ideal environment for you to talk with them about Bitcoin are the exact reasons why they have the potential to orange pill others.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Right Approach</h2><p>To discuss Bitcoin with your barber or stylist, consider their interests and what might best resonate with them. Are they concerned about rising costs? Do they have family members living in authoritarian countries? Choose your approach based on your understanding of their needs.</p><p>If you're unsure about your approach or just recently began going to a new barber or stylist, don’t talk to them about Bitcoin. Talk to them about Lightning instead.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Lightning As A Cheat Code</h2><p>As the saying goes, "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach." Similarly, the way to a business owner's heart is through their wallet. People naturally follow their incentives, and your barber or stylist will be intrigued if you discuss how Lightning payments can increase their profits. Share some benefits of accepting Lightning payments, such as:</p><ul><li>Fast: Funds are available immediately</li><li>Cheap: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">Significant savings</a> compared to typical credit card fees</li><li>Final: No chargebacks</li><li>Growth: Reaching a new client base and expanding their business</li></ul><p>Once they are curious, demonstrate the ease of using Lightning by having them download your favorite Lightning wallet and sending them some sats. Then, have them send you half the sats back. Show them the minimal fees and remind them that those funds are theirs (final) the moment they receive them. The combination of hearing you describe the benefits, seeing how easy it is to use and doing a transaction themselves is a powerful, persuasive mechanism to pique their interest and demystify the process.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Is your color still processing, or are you getting a shave? If you are there for a longer appointment, they might have time to express concern about bitcoin's volatility. If they do, explain that, just as the price of Visa’s stock doesn’t affect the value of their credit card transactions, the price of bitcoin doesn’t have to affect the value of their Lightning payments. You can also introduce them to services like <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/">Ibex</a> or <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a> which can protect them against price fluctuations. </p><p>If they wonder how accepting Lightning can help them find new customers, show them how tools like <a href="https://btcmap.org/">BTC Map</a> and <a href="https://satmap.app/">Satmap</a> offer free marketing for their shop or salon, or how tools like <a href="https://www.oshi.tech/">Oshi</a> and <a href="https://joltzrewards.com/">Joltz Rewards</a> make it easy for them to engage with and retain their new Bitcoin clients. </p><p>Most importantly, remember that they do not need to commit to the Bitcoin revolution on day one. Instead, get them interested and experiencing the benefits of Lightning first. They'll want to know more soon enough.</p><p>Finally, you do not have to cover all of these elements in one visit. Conversion can take time. Luckily, you’ll be back in a few weeks for your next visit and can pick up where you left off.</p><h2>The Finishing Touch</h2><p><br>Introducing your barber or stylist to Lightning payments can enhance their business and help you promote Bitcoin to a broader audience by leaning on the unique relationship you share with them.

Yet, every year, the debate continues about whether bitcoin should evolve to become something more. Can “digital” gold also be the world’s currency? Could Bitcoin’s blockchain be used to register assets of value? Should it?</p><p>This conversation has peaked with the launch of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens</a>, driving even more demand to the Bitcoin blockchain. And understandably so — Bitcoin’s peerless security and stability made it known as the blockchain of value. Now that it is possible to store a growing range of assets there, people want to. This is welcome news for the store-of-value proponents, as demand for bitcoin should drive up the price. </p><p>But more transactions also mean more competition, and if you want your transaction to go through, that means more fees and longer confirmation times. This is not ideal for the supporters that prefer bitcoin as a currency and the growing competition for block space is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space">already affecting the ability to register assets</a>. </p><h2>The Economist’s Evolutionary Theory</h2><p>This dilemma isn’t new for Bitcoin. Its intentional restriction of the block size and transaction capacity has pioneered great tech, like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-does-the-lightning-network-work">Lightning Network</a>, and instigated debates over adopting <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/colored-coins">colored coins</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-miners-and-core-developers-release-segwit-hard-fork-agreement-1457018394">SegWit</a> and other Core changes.</p><p>And Bitcoin is not an exception. When other blockchains came into the market, their ability to handle ERC-20 tokens, NFTs and other operations restricted their popularity. Ethereum was faced with similar limitations, but somewhat resolved them with technical upgrades. However, this led DApps to find shelter in alternative chains. This led to severe interoperability issues, but the economist’s "evolutionary theory" held true: The market moves in the direction of maximum opportunity.</p><p>Looking from an economist's perspective, it's crucial to note that bitcoin's utility as a store of value is still not widely adopted beyond our sector. During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, we were curious to see how the crisis (the very kind that Bitcoin was designed for) would stimulate demand for the cryptocurrency. What surfaced instead was that, while some people did buy and HODL, others clearly still preferred to save in their fiat currency and happily accepted fiat currency support payments. Even as these fiat payments, unfortunately, have been severely depreciated due to inflation, widespread global investment and adoption of bitcoin didn’t materialize. </p><p>But what is happening behind closed doors? Bitcoin is entering the treasury reserves of many institutions, banks and countries. They realize its value, and are already using it as a hedge against the next financial or global crisis. </p><p>When considering the future, the pandemic is really an example of why we should be optimistic about the point that Bitcoin has reached. Although it is not the global reserve (yet), it has succeeded. It took Google around 17 years from its founding, and 11 years from its IPO, to reach a <a href="https://disfold.com/company/alphabet-inc/marketcap/">$500 billion market cap</a>. Bitcoin did this <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/data-insights/financial-services/bitcoins-market-capitalization-history/">in less than 12 years</a>, and didn’t sell our data to advertisers to do it. Not only that, but it has advanced significantly while still being a proof-of-work blockchain. There are many other chains that have continuously and expensively iterated, facing diminished returns. Not Bitcoin.</p><p>However, we know it is impossible for Bitcoin to evolve into what everyone wants it to be. There is no way (yet) to create a blockchain that can be a store of value, a mode of transaction and a home for NFTs, tokens and other valuable assets. But if the market seeks a one-stop blockchain for all of these uses, then either Bitcoin will become it or another blockchain will. </p><h2>Bitcoin’s Race To Lose</h2><p>Of course, this “one blockchain to rule them all” thinking drove many people to Ethereum, and its domination has yet to materialize. Bitcoin could learn from Ethereum’s mistakes and use this time to re-define its identity and purpose in the market. For certain, it will remain the first and still most successful example of widespread digital currency that also solves the problem of trust. A truly decentralized, self-sovereign monetary system needs trust. Bitcoin provides that trust — and brilliantly does so with trustlessness. Whatever it evolves into, this is core to its value as a system.</p><p>And Bitcoin, being the freest market that has ever existed, will indeed continue to evolve. Its independence drives its adaptability to changing market conditions, and that is what makes it, still, the blockchain of choice for many. </p><p>Of course, as a free market, we can only influence it through our daily actions. That is not a flaw of Bitcoin. This is its best feature, and the surest predictor of its ongoing successful evolution.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Paolo Tasca.

While many are too scared of thinking about it, a large number of people simply feel that they lack the know-how for setting one up or want to wait until they have children before they feel the need to sort out their afterlives.</p><p>Over the last year or so, I decided to have this “will” discussion with myself, and after much thinking and many hours of research, the answer for the best method of inheritance to establish in my own will seemed obvious: Bitcoin. </p><p>As things stand in the world today, you are bound to end up with issues if you don’t set up a will. Let’s say that you kick the bucket tomorrow without an inheritance plan drawn up. The first thing that might happen is that all of your <a href="https://trustandwill.com/learn/dying-without-a-will">assets could be frozen</a> until the courts take their sweet time digging through every detail of your estate. This alone can take from several months to several years, depending on where you live and the assets that are in your name. If you were married and died intestate (without a will), your spouse might end up having to find an executor, which often costs a lot of money, and then comes the months of paperwork and infighting with long-lost relatives who might suddenly start showing up at your doorstep. Along with all of this drama could come the taxman, ready to act as the grim reaper of the assets you leave behind, often taking huge percentages of your life savings. </p><p>With all this in mind, setting up your will with BTC can solve many problems for those who you leave behind in the land of the living. I will be going through some of my thoughts on this and explaining exactly why I have decided to set up my will with Bitcoin.</p><h2>Advantages Of Bitcoin Over Traditional Assets</h2><p>To me, it all came down to two aspects, with the first being accessibility. With physical assets, you end up having to do more than just paperwork when passing on your property after death. Whether it is gold bars, a cellar of investment-grade whisky or expensive paintings, there is a certain level of expertise needed to move these items from one place to the next and then to look after them properly. </p><p>Bitcoin solves this for me. Here you have an asset that doesn’t need anything other <a href="https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/wallets.html">than a 256-bit long combination</a> to be accessed globally, without your next of kin having to wait months to gain access to frozen accounts. This combination can hold all of the value that I wish to pass on, without the need for any fancy, temperature-controlled room or two-ton safe. This way, value can easily be transferred to and accessed by beneficiaries across the globe without the need for intermediaries.</p><p>The other aspect of BTC that makes it good to use as an inheritance device is its privacy aspect. We all know that Bitcoin's blockchain technology is as safe as can be, thus eliminating any security risks, but what about privacy? Sure, it might be possible to track who owns BTC if you know who a wallet belongs to, but as with most of us HODLrs, we tend to keep things on the downlow. </p><p>So, BTC offers security, accessibility and privacy, but it also occurred to me that there might be some issues with this scheme, so I got to listing them and thinking each one through.</p><h2>The Challenges And Risks Of Transferring Bitcoin</h2><p>Security seemed a no-brainer with respect to keeping my stash of coins safe for those I want to leave it to, but then again, how does one transfer said coins or pass a wallet on in a safe way? Setting up a smart contract that will execute upon your demise seemed to be the perfect solution, but then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/science/elon-musks-neuralink-gets-us-fda-approval-human-clinical-study-brain-implants-2023-05-25/">Elon Musk started those human trials with his brain implants</a>, so this idea might still be a few years off. </p><h3>Knowhow</h3><p>So, you might be thinking, go old school and get a safety deposit box at a normal bank to leave your private key in a well-protected spot, and include instructions in your will that will make the situation clear to those you left behind. But even then, there is a certain amount of technical competence that will be required for your beneficiaries to be able to navigate the intricacies of Bitcoin ownership. </p><p>Using BTC has become significantly more straightforward than it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinoconnell/2019/12/23/the-2010s-in-bitcoin-the-year-2010/">back in 2010</a>, but it still requires a level of technical understanding which can pose a challenge for heirs who may not be familiar with cryptocurrencies. The solution here is obvious: Educate your people about the glories of Bitcoin before you end up six feet under.</p><h3>Value And Distribution</h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052014/why-bitcoins-value-so-volatile.asp">Bitcoin's price fluctuations</a> might be something that could scare people off from even considering this asset as a store of value that can be passed on, but there is no doubt in my mind that one day, even a single satoshi will be worth a pretty penny. </p><p>The problem comes from the fact that, while I am still alive, I want to continue using crypto exchanges to trade and add to my supply of bitcoin. So, how can an ever-evolving bitcoin stack be evenly divided after my death? Well, this is really quite simple, just allocate a percentage of your coins to each beneficiary. This way, you can keep adding to your nest egg, and it doesn’t matter how many coins you have or how volatile the market might be, the right percentage will make it into the right hands.</p><h2>Tools For Bitcoin Inheritance Planning</h2><p>OK, so, in my dive down the BTC-will rabbit hole, I did manage to find a few tips and tools that should be helpful when planning what happens to your stuff once you enter the eternal rest. Let me just briefly touch on two of them:</p><h3>Multi-Signature Wallets</h3><p>This one is perfect for those who are scared that one of their relatives will try to swindle the rest or something like that. One way you might use multi-signature wallets can be in your lawyer and beneficiaries each having to authorize a transaction in order for it to be carried out. This added layer of security can be an easy way of setting up your will without going through too much technical trouble. For me, this multi-signature wallet approach is a fantastic idea and one I have already implemented.</p><h3>Bitcoin Estate Planning Services</h3><p>Believe it or not, I wasn’t the first person to think of this. Specialized bitcoin estate planning services are out there and they offer solutions to securely manage and transfer bitcoin holdings after you breathe your last. These services can help a ton by providing expert guidance and reducing the risk of loss or mishandling of the bitcoin by those who are not too clued in with blockchain technology.

Built using LDK and BDK, LDK Node provides a straightforward interface and an integrated on-chain wallet, allowing developers to quickly and easily establish a Lightning node within a day.</p><p>Unlike its predecessor LDK, which offers extensive customization options but requires a deeper understanding of protocol fundamentals, LDK Node focuses on simplicity and ease of use. With a reduced API surface comprising around 30 API calls, LDK Node simplifies the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in various use cases while hiding protocol complexities.</p><p>The initial release of LDK Node includes several design choices and modules. The integrated BDK wallet handles on-chain data, and chain data can be sourced from an <a href="https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora">Esplora</a> server, with support for <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a> and bitcoind RPC planned for the future. Gossip data can be obtained via Lightning's peer-to-peer network or the Rapid Gossip Sync (RGS) protocol. LDK Node also offers the means to source entropy for Lightning and on-chain wallets, as well as generate and persist entropy bytes to disk.</p><p>LDK Node is specifically designed to facilitate the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in mobile applications. Its features are tailored for mobile deployments, with integration options available for Swift, Kotlin, Python and Flutter. By offering language bindings and compatibility with mobile environments, LDK Node aims to simplify the process of deploying self-custodial Lightning nodes on end-user devices.</p><p>Looking ahead, the development team behind LDK Node has already started working on the next release, which will introduce support for sourcing chain data from Electrum or bitcoind RPC and persistence to a Versioned Storage Service (VSS) backend. Integration with the Language Server Protocol (LSP) specification is also in progress. The team is actively considering adding server-grade modules in the future.</p><p>For developers interested in exploring LDK Node, the <a href="https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node">GitHub repository</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/ldk-node/0.1.0/ldk_node/">API documentation</a>, and <a href="https://crates.io/">Rust Crate</a> provide further resources. Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/reez/Monday">there is a showcase called Monday Wallet</a>, an example wallet built with LDK Node Swift bindings, demonstrating the capabilities of the library in real-world applications.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Catawba Nation Is Seeking Seasoned Banking Regulators To Help Grow Their Bitcoin-Friendly Jurisdiction]]></title><description><![CDATA[With state-level jurisdictional sovereignty, the Catawba Digital Economic Zone seeks to create an environment conducive to the growth of the digital asset industry.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/catawba-nation-is-seeking-seasoned-banking-regulators-for-bitcoin-friendly-jurisdiction</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/catawba-nation-is-seeking-seasoned-banking-regulators-for-bitcoin-friendly-jurisdiction</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Banking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 16:27:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The Catawba Nation, a sovereign federally recognized tribal government, has established the <a href="https://catawbadigital.zone/">Catawba Digital Economic Zone</a> (CDEZ), a special jurisdiction within the Catawba Reservation in South Carolina, aimed at empowering emerging digital technology companies, including Bitcoin companies.

    </figure><p>In the cryptocurrency world, bold bets and outrageous predictions are not uncommon. And yet, Balaji Srinivasan, a prominent and occasionally-controversial figure in crypto and tech, made major finance headlines when he announced a daring wager that bitcoin <a href="https://qz.com/balaji-srinivasan-lost-1-million-in-a-bizarre-bitcoin-1850399034">would reach a staggering $1 million per coin within 90 days</a>. </p><p>The Bitcoin and larger crypto community immediately began analyzing what drove him to make such a daring statement. Srinivasan predicted this <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636797265317867520">on March 17, 2023</a> — when bitcoin was trading at $26,000 in the middle of a bearish market. The <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1637625020792049664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1637625020792049664%7Ctwgr%5E5fa19b38c10dd3afc5c1d0bf3ab065dec500e95b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fbalajis%2Fstatus%2F1637625020792049664image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935">terms of the bet</a> stated that if the bitcoin price did not reach $1 million by June 17, 2023, he would pay out $1 million to the other party, Twitter pundit James Medlock. The bet would settle in USDC stablecoin. Srinivasan estimated the odds at forty to one. </p><p>Many were skeptical about the pronouncement, calling it clout chasing, a marketing ploy and even a pump-and-dump scheme. Swan Bitcoin co-founder Cory Klippsten brought up Srinivasan's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/03/20/who-is-balaji-srinivasan-and-why-should-we-care-about-his-1-million-bitcoin-prediction/?sh=3b00ac1a5bd1">history of promoting altcoins</a>, which earned him the ire of Bitcoin Maximalists. Many in the crypto world were dumbfounded yet intrigued enough to investigate what made him take the bet and whether he would be good for the money if he were to lose. </p><p>Along with his audacious prediction, Srinivasan talked about the Federal Reserve's money printing and dollar devaluation. He <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638731349489238017">warned</a> against the Fed's rate hikes, saying they weren't anti-inflation but <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/balaji-srinivasan-warns-about-the-fed-s-trillion-dollar-printing-press/ar-AA18YPfU">a smokescreen aimed at propping up a banking system</a> on the brink of collapse. </p><p>Fast forward to May 2, 2023, when Srinivasan <a href="https://decrypt.co/138632/balaji-srinivasan-burns-1-million-bitcoin">conceded his bet early</a> and said it had been closed out "by mutual agreement." Medlock <a href="https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1653453502365196288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1653453502365196288%7Ctwgr%5E9d6fe1ce7435b7059c327214211d5aa604b56bc2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjdcmedlock%2Fstatus%2F1653453502365196288image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07">acknowledged the payment</a> on his Twitter account. </p><p>In a video <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409">posted and pinned on his Twitter profile</a>, Srinivasan explained the previously-veiled reasoning behind his public relations stunt. Outside of his explanation, this article delves into the possible motivations behind Srinivasan's audacious bet, explores his background and involvement in the crypto industry and reviews the impact of such announcements on the global Bitcoin community. </p><p>Furthermore, I will discuss why, despite the short-term failure, Srinivasan's stunt may hold some validity for the future, exploring the financial and economic conditions in which bitcoin could potentially be an <a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/how-to-open-crypto-account-for-minors/">ideal long-term investment</a>, and could eventually reach a value of $1 million.</p><h2>Understanding Srinivasan's Background</h2><p>To properly dissect the controversial bet, it's essential to understand its maker's significance within the crypto industry and beyond. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaji_Srinivasan">Srinivasan is a well-known entrepreneur, technologist and investor</a> who has significantly contributed to the cryptocurrency industry. </p><p>He co-founded 21 Inc., a Bitcoin mining startup that later became Earn.com, a model allowing senders to pay users in crypto to reply to emails. Earn.com was subsequently acquired by Coinbase in April 2018 and launched as Coinbase Earn. Balaji then became the first CTO of Coinbase. Coinbase Earn shut down in 2019.</p><p>Srinivasan is renowned for his deep understanding of technology and ability to identify emerging trends in the industry. He joined venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a general partner in 2013. He holds a master’s degree in chemical engineering and in electrical engineering. He has previously taught at Stanford University. He has sometimes been hailed as a polymath because of his multiple involvements in various tech spaces. </p><h2>Possible Motivations Behind The Bitcoin Bet</h2><h3>Attention And Publicity</h3><p>By making such an extravagant bet, Srinivasan courted substantial attention and media coverage. As such, Srinivasan's bet may have been a strategic move to gain visibility for himself and his viewpoints within the crypto community. </p><h3>Challenging Conventional Thinking</h3><p>Through a publicity stunt, Srinivasan may have sought to challenge skeptics and provoke discussions on the transformative power of Bitcoin. Such bold statements can spark debate and encourage critical analysis of cryptocurrencies' underlying technologies and economic principles.</p><h3>Advocacy For Bitcoin</h3><p>While he has been criticized for promoting altcoins and pump-and-dump schemes, Srinivasan remains an ardent supporter of Bitcoin and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. The $1 million bet could have been an attempt to showcase his unwavering belief in Bitcoin's future success and encourage others to consider its potential. </p><p>Some critics, however, saw it as an attempt at price manipulation. It could also have been an attempt on his part to regain credibility and position himself as a “mostly Bitcoin” advocate after his previous, alleged attempts at alt-crypto promotion. </p><h3>A Means Of Raising Public Alarm</h3><p>It also may be that he genuinely feels strongly for a cause and saw the bet as a means of starting a robust discussion around a pressing economic issue involving inflation and the benefits of bitcoin as a safe haven asset.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Effects Of Exaggerated Bets On Bitcoin Culture</h2><p>Exaggerated bets and pronouncements have become a part of the Bitcoin culture, with enthusiasts and experts constantly making predictions about future prices and market movements. While these bold claims generate excitement and media attention, they can contribute to unrealistic expectations, market manipulation and excessive speculation. </p><p>Influencers need to exercise restraint because the Bitcoin and larger cryptocurrency communities are highly reactive and trade the news. Moreover, investors and participants in the space need to exercise caution, conduct thorough research and base their decisions on sound analysis rather than relying solely on sensational predictions.</p><h2>Burning $1 Million To Prove A Point</h2><p>As noted above, on May 3, 2023, Srinivasan <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409?s=20">posted a video</a> on his official Twitter account with the stark caption, "I burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions."</p><p>Whether this is a genuine and sincere effort to sound the alarm on the U.S. government and the Fed's harmful policies or a mere save for a failure at price prediction is best left to the reader to judge. However, Srinivasan made several valid points that push his argument about hyperinflation and its dangers.</p><p>"I wanted to tell you in a provable way — to send a provable signal — that the economy was wrong. I'm not in the habit of burning a million bucks for the sake of it," he said in the video. "There's something wrong with the economy, and the state is not telling you about it. And things could unwind very fast." </p><p>He then pointed to the speed of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) to the government's subsequent printing of $300 billion. He also mentioned that after SVB, there have been $500 billion in outflows from small lenders to money market funds and big banks. </p><p>He compared the speed of these phenomena to the span from concrete COVID-19 announcements to the sudden implementation of lockdowns — from Ben Bernanke's announcement of a "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2008/04/10/bernanke-says-us-could-be-facing-a-mild-recession.html">mild recession</a>" in 2008 to a full-fledged global financial crisis, which took just two quarters to unravel. </p><p>"In each of these cases," Srinivasan added, "too slow was being too late."</p><p>Srinivasan argued that in today's U.S. economy, "many things are breaking at once." The most glaring issue, in his opinion, is the U.S. debt ceiling, wherein markets were predicting a high probability of sovereign default. He quoted "Dr. Doom" economist Nouriel Roubini, saying that most U.S. banks are near insolvency. Roubini has confirmed this sentiment, saying that U.S. regional banks <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nouriel-roubini-us-regional-banks-certainly-face-credit-crunch-2023-5">face a credit crunch</a>. </p><p>Furthermore, he drew parallels to 2008, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/briefing/bank-failures-first-republic-bank.html">successive bank failures</a> within a short period and commercial real estate prices crashing by double digits. Traditional safe havens like bonds, he contended, aren't safe. Insurance is under pressure as well. </p><p>He also mentioned the phenomena of <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/de-dollarization-what-happens-if-the-dollar-loses-reserve-status">de-dollarization</a>, decreasing U.S. dominance on the global stage, as manifested by the movement of other countries away from the USD as their medium of exchange or store of value. He also pointed out the reallocation movements of smart money and central banks toward gold. </p><p>Afterward, he asked whether anyone sees infinite dollar printing continuing for centuries or whether other — shorter — timelines are more probable. Could the system collapse happen within months, years or decades? He made a probability estimate for each. He proceeded to recommend that if you believe the system collapse may happen sooner than the highly-optimistic span of centuries, you must take appropriate action.</p><p>He then confirmed his reason for the bet: to raise public alarm at his own expense. While this is a radical way to draw attention to a thesis, it does put the spotlight on brewing economic problems and on Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Will Bitcoin Reach $1 Million Anyway?</h2><p>While Srinivasan's bet did not materialize as expected, it does not necessarily discredit the possibility of bitcoin reaching a value of $1 million per coin in the future. Several economic and financial conditions could contribute to such a scenario:</p><h3>Widespread Institutional Adoption</h3><p>Increased acceptance and adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors, banks and governments could drive significant demand and price appreciation. Institutional involvement would provide legitimacy and stability to the market, attracting more capital and increasing the price.</p><h3>Limited Supply And Halving Events</h3><p>Bitcoin's scarcity is a crucial factor in its value proposition. As the supply of new coins decreases due to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-the-halvening">halving events</a> that occur roughly every four years, the reduction in the inflation rate could exert upward pressure on the price, potentially leading to substantial appreciation.</p><h3>Global Economic Instability</h3><p>Economic crises, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp">hyperinflation</a> or a loss of faith in traditional financial systems could prompt individuals and institutions to seek alternative stores of value, such as bitcoin. In such circumstances, the demand for bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty could skyrocket, potentially driving the price to extraordinary levels.</p><h2>Future Potential</h2><p>Balaji Srinivasan's bold bet on Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin within 90 days was a daring move that captured the attention of the crypto community and the media. Despite the short-term and possibly intentional failure of the bet, Srinivasan's bet raised essential questions about the future potential of Bitcoin. </p><p>Given the right economic and financial conditions, including widespread institutional adoption, limited supply and global economic instability, bitcoin could very well reach $1 million per coin. But, as with any investment, caution, thorough research, and a long-term perspective are essential when considering the possibilities and risks associated with bitcoin.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ivan Serrano.

Last week, the Powell-led central bank had decided to temporarily pause rate hikes&nbsp;— the fastest and most aggressive interest rate increases in U.S. history —&nbsp;in their mission to battle the massive <em>price</em> inflation found downstream from the lockdown-induced <em>monetary</em> inflation via stimulus measures. Less than a month away from the announced July launch of FedNow, an inter-bank communication platform, Powell finds himself at a crossroad of monetary policy, regulation and capital requirements before the formal founding of the digital dollar system.</p><h2>The New Dollar: FedNow &amp; USTs, Not Retail CBDCs </h2><blockquote><p>“The status of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency is very important.” <br></p><p>- Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>The dollar has been digitized for a long time; be it the Zelle or Venmo credits in your retail account, or the dollar balance in your checking account at Bank of America. But generally speaking, the mechanisms behind the transfer of Treasuries and other reserve assets backing these numbers on a screen have remained at the technical agility of a fax machine. The dollar may be the world reserve <em>currency</em>, and can be transacted via intermediaries on obvious centralized banker rails, or less obviously on Ethereum rails via ERC-20 tokens in the form of popular retail stablecoins, but the U.S. Treasuries held by these novel credit creators remain the world reserve <em>asset</em>. These bonds are strictly issued by the U.S. Treasury to be sold to the private sector to create dollars, incentivized with yields dependent on the federal funding rate set by the Federal Reserve. The public has generally feared the direct issuance of some form of retail CBDC (central bank digital currency) due to surveillance concerns and currency seizure from a centralized issuer, but fewer realize both the level of financial surveillance already imposed by banks, never mind the ability for these trusted third parties to censor, blacklist and even expose retail to their counter-party risk. All of these actions are made increasingly possible via the digitization of the currency with an encroaching reliance on centralized payment rails, but up until next month, the communication network for interbank asset trades has remained lossy and slow.</p><p>FedNow, slated to launch next month, serves multiple purposes, but perhaps none as important as creating a much more efficient lever for the Fed to have 365/24/7 control on overnight banking rates, such as SOFR, effectively setting the cost of borrowing short-term liquidity between fractionalized private banks attempting to meet their depositors’ withdrawals. You have probably heard the phrase “reverse repo” once or twice, but the underlying mechanic is often misunderstood. The “repo” stands for a repurchasing agreement; essentially a contract between two entities in which Bank A, with excess dollar liquidity, agrees to lend cash to Bank B, with overnight liquidity needs, via a short-term loan collateralized by Bank B’s assets such as USTs, with the conditions that Bank B will <em>repurchase</em> their securities, usually the next morning (“overnight”), plus a percentage-based fee that Bank A gets to keep. A reverse repo is essentially the same behavior, except that Bank A is bond-rich, cash-poor and thus asking Bank B for dollar-denominated liquidity. This exact scenario came to fruition within the recent regional bank failures in the U.S., and the Fed created new mechanisms to backstop the liquidity needs of the depositors. In the case of the ever-growing reverse repo market, Bank B is routinely the largest American banks, and sometimes even the Fed directly. FedNow is a digital lever, made possible via the internet, for complete centralized control on the overnight rate of borrowing dollars, the necessary transferring of Treasuries between banks, and thus the reshoring of dollar-denominated activity away from the Eurodollar market, and back to the United States within the scope of the Fed and the Treasury. </p><h2>Private-Entity Dollar Issuance</h2><blockquote><p>“We would not support a central bank digital currency for individuals. If we did have a CBDC, it would be intermediated by banks.” <br></p><p>- Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>Shortly after the fall of FTX last fall, the NY Fed launched their digital dollar pilot program, featuring BNY Mellon, PNC Bank, Citi, HSBC, Mastercard, TD Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, as well as cooperation with SWIFT. Notable within this quorum of too big to fail private sector banks is the inclusion of BNY Mellon, the largest U.S. bank, who holds treasuries for popular stablecoin USDC, and PNC Bank, the former 22.4% owner of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, who only earlier this week filed with the SEC for approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has recently made waves themselves by filing their own notices against Binance and the publicly listed Coinbase for brokering sales of unregistered securities in the form of cryptocurrency tokens. While BUSD, the Binance-issued USD stablecoin, was listed as being an unregistered security, USDC, the Circle-issued USD stablecoin, second in market cap value behind only Tether, was left off the notices, despite listings on both exchanges. Powell took the idea of stablecoins being important to the Fed and the greater U.S. dollar system a step further this morning when he insinuated that not only are stablecoins not a security, they are money. "We do see payment stablecoins as a form of money, and in all advanced economies, the ultimate source of credibility in money is the central bank…We believe it would be appropriate to have quite a robust federal role in what happens in stablecoins going forward."</p><p>He went on to further articulate his views on not needing a direct-issued government dollar, and instead relying on the private sector banks to continue their role of government debt purchasing via USTs in order to create credit via dollars in retail accounts. "We would not support accounts at the Federal Reserve by individuals…such accounts would be managed through the banking system.” In February, the SEC served a Wells Notice to Paxos, the issuer of BUSD, directly limiting Binance’s ability to compete in the dollar creation industry. Via the signatures from the arms of regulation from the Fed, the Treasury, the SEC and even the Department of Justice, the entities allowed to make digital dollars are being hand selected in front of our eyes. In order to continue the cycle of needing to purchase government-issued debt to create dollars, the U.S. government has moved to direct policy, regulatory comment, and even disciplinary action on off-shore dollar creation, changing the landscape for stablecoins, and even the dollar itself, forever, mere moments before the founding of the digital Federal Reserve. </p><h2>Basel III</h2><blockquote><p>“Basel III is an international capital requirement we should go ahead and complete.”<br></p><p> - Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>As American commercial banks begin to integrate digital assets such as bitcoin and dollar-derivatives such as stablecoins, the need to ensure the public that on-sheet liquidity for speculative action on commodities exists creates a unique opportunity to tilt regulation in the favor of the dollar. Basel III would require any bank wanting to hold bitcoin, other digital assets, or even gold, would also be required to hold an equal-part dollar to dollar-denominated valuation of their investments. This sudden comment on adoption of this international capital requirement would force a net-demand for dollars in the U.S banking system, despite a high monetary inflationary environment. For banks or registered investment vehicles looking to offset inflationary effects by purchasing alternative reserve assets such as bitcoin, this regulation would mean that an increase of valuation of bitcoin in a dollar-pair would also increase the need for dollar liabilities on their balance sheet. Want to run a responsible bank and meet capital requirements while also holding bitcoin on your balance sheet? Better be prepared to also hold a lot of dollars. The idea of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-birth-of-the-bitcoin-dollar">Bitcoin-Dollar</a> is a parallel to the petro-dollar system, which was upheld from the gold window closing via the Nixon shock until only somewhat recently. By creating a monopoly on the in’s and out’s of oil to strictly U.S. dollars, the U.S. was essentially able to re-peg their inflating dollar to an ever-demanded energy commodity, and create a mass buyer of dollars. As the Fed and SEC circle the waters on both regional banks and private issuers of stablecoins, the downstream effect of Basel III will create permanent demand for dollars, even in a “hyperbitcoinization” environment. Powell mentioned the Fed doesn’t have specifics on proposals for capital requirements at this time, but that there will be a future proposal that comes to the Fed board later this summer.</p><h2>BlackRock ETF</h2><blockquote><p>“Let me tell you, it’s not who the President is. It’s who’s controlling the wallet of the President.” <br></p><p>- Serge Varlay, BlackRock Recruiter</p></blockquote><p>The recent application filing from BlackRock, an investment firm with assets under management totalling $10 trillion, has kicked off a filing spree from other institutional asset managers in the race for the first approved exchange-traded fund offering exposure to bitcoin. WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Invesco have all since filed to the SEC seeking to launch Bitcoin ETFs, despite a universal rejection of every spot Bitcoin ETF application previously filed, notably including NYDIG, CBOE, and Fidelity. The newly found resurgence in confidence of approval perhaps comes downstream of BlackRock’s near perfect record of getting ETFs approved, sitting at a 575 to 1 success rate. Within iSHARES Bitcoin Trust Form <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htm">S-1</a> Registration Statement was their disclosure of using Coinbase for bitcoin custody, as well as a notice of potential conflict of interest within an affiliate of theirs acting as investment manager to a money market fund, the Circle Reserve Fund, which the issuer of USDC uses to “hold cash, U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations insured or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Treasury and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations or cash, which serves as reserves backing USDC stablecoins." It later states that “an affiliate of the Sponsor [BlackRock] has a minority equity interest in the issuer of USDC." The S-1 includes a line stating the “price of bitcoin may be affected due to stablecoins (including Tether and USDC), the activities of stablecoin issuers and their regulatory treatment." The Cash Custodian and Trust Administrator of the BlackRock ETF is listed as the aforementioned digital dollar pilot program partner Bank of New York Mellon.</p><p>While ETFs are often used as a mechanism to short commodities by large financial institutions, the recent signaling from the most important U.S. regulatory bodies reveals a real possibility of increased digital dollar creation and an increased purchasing power of the demand-inelastic reserve asset, bitcoin. There is perhaps no larger investment firm than BlackRock, and no larger banking entity than Bank of New York Mellon. There are few government bodies more influential on the global economy than the Fed and the SEC. </p><p>Welcome to institutional adoption. Just don’t fucking dance.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4ODI5MTkzNjA4ODk3ODk5/goodpicture1.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valkyrie Investments Joins Flurry Of Firms Filing For Spot Bitcoin ETFs]]></title><description><![CDATA[A newly updated spot bitcoin ETF by Valkyrie Investments adds to a slew of institutional filings following BlackRock’s.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs</guid><category><![CDATA[Valkyrie]]></category><category><![CDATA[Spot Bitcoin Etf]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[ETFs]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 21:01:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Amidst a surge of activity within the ETF space, Valkyrie Investments has made significant moves to establish its presence once again.

Notably, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">filed a spot bitcoin ETF application</a>, perhaps taking advantage of recent regulatory scrutiny to facilitate its entry into the market.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at the price increases over the past few years after our conversation and I wondered: Will this alternative currency continue to rise in value, or is it a big Ponzi scheme that will soon collapse in on itself?</p><p>I started to read up on the subject and quickly realized that the influencers on Twitter were often playing with the emotions of their audiences — with fear and greed, to name the most common ones. I could hardly believe some of the exaggerated posts, and yet they drew me in.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1379127189321420808"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>It was obvious to me that social media influenced private individuals in their actions when it came to Bitcoin. In my studies, I learned about many theories and models in media psychology, which I can apply to the Bitcoin market and which might help others do the same.</p><h2>Media Psychology Concepts And Bitcoin Twitter</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_and_gratifications_theory">uses-and-gratifications theory</a> assumes that recipients choose the medium that can best satisfy their needs. Depending on the medium, a person seeks information, entertainment, personal identity (reinforcement of one's own values) or integration and social interaction (exchanges among like-minded people). For me, I mix all four motives right away. </p><p>The involvement concept, which suggests that a recipient can still be involved with the content of an article even days after reading it, if that person is directly affected by the developments or the views represented. However, this does not mean that attitudes can be permanently changed. The more involved a judging individual is in a topic, the less he or she can be influenced by persuasion from other opinions. The interplay between the emotions of greed and fear and the resulting experienced tension diminishes over time and with experience. </p><p>In my environment, everyone, without exception, has confirmed this phenomenon. After your first bitcoin purchase, for instance, you are susceptible to being easily manipulated. With every additional hour that you deal with the matter, your opinion becomes stronger. You may accept price distortions more and more easily and, in the meantime, see the incentive to buy sats at a lower price.</p><p>Remaining mindful of why you are on Bitcoin Twitter in the first place, and how the content there is impacting you, will help you navigate it.</p><h2>How To Handle Bitcoin Twitter</h2><p>The enormous price gains are, in my opinion, the strongest narrative that draws retail investors into the bitcoin market. The most common type of posts that I see on Bitcoin Twitter are positive price forecasts. These generate clicks, have the potential to trigger fear of missing out (FOMO) and entice private investors to make rash purchases.</p><p>How strongly an individual reacts to information with positive connotations, or to information with negative connotations in a phase of strong price decay, and whether an action results from this, ultimately depends on the motive and the experienced emotions of a recipient, as well as the behavior of the influencers consumed. But the natural human trait of being guided by emotions means that new investors could pay the highest prices at the end of an upswing and sell these positions at losses when prices correct, in fear of a total collapse. This is why anyone entering the Bitcoin space this way should keep in mind the psychological factors at play.</p><p>One suggestion I have is to remain strong-minded. If someone’s investment goes into the red, their mood usually dips. But losses and gains don't materialize if you don't cash out. But I believe that four out of five people don't hold to this, emotionally. That's where you have to be tough as nails. There is an age-old wisdom that should be drilled into every private investor: You can never catch two things, the top and the bottom. "Simply doing nothing" is historically best in a market that is going up in the medium to long term.</p><p>Another valuable lesson for me was to realize that, in today's globally-connected world, it has become increasingly difficult to separate the clickbaiters and scammers from the valuable content with strong communities. This means that someone who wants to learn about Bitcoin via Twitter should first do the work of "separating the junk from the good sources" in their own research. An investment should never be made based on just one opinion or source.</p><h2>Manipulation Via Media</h2><p>Manipulation via media is by no means a new phenomenon and media history shows that it can hardly be eliminated with regulation. </p><p>But social media accelerates the impact of contributions and enlarges spheres of influence, accentuating the problem. My goal is to motivate critical engagement with media, even knowing that, globally, this is a difficult endeavor. After all, the ability to critically examine media and one's own emotional reactions would be a considerable benefit in all areas of life.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Thierry Berger.

Although the name indicates a trust, both WisdomTree’s filing and BlackRock’s filings function as spot ETFs, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyWcmqD6ibM">explained further here</a>.</p><p>While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected previous applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, it has approved Bitcoin futures ETFs. The filings by BlackRock and WisdomTree reflect the industry's push to provide investors with regulated options for participating in the bitcoin market, albeit at the cost of properties exclusive to sovereign bitcoin usage.</p><p>The consecutive filings by BlackRock and WisdomTree highlight the increasing recognition of Bitcoin's potential in traditional finance. By applying for spot ETFs, these asset management giants are acknowledging the demand for regulated investment vehicles in the space. The filings may pave the way for broader adoption and a new wave of institutional investors entering the bitcoin market.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNDgzNTg3/bitcoin-to-the-moon.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine PRO And Samara Asset Group Launch Bitcoin Alpha Competition, Offering $1 Million Seed Capital For Top Bitcoin Fund Manager]]></title><description><![CDATA[The competition aims to connect participants with high-net-worth Bitcoin investors, institutional allocators and the vibrant Bitcoin community.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-magazine-pro-and-samara-asset-group-launch-bitcoin-alpha-competition</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-magazine-pro-and-samara-asset-group-launch-bitcoin-alpha-competition</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Amsterdam]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 18:38:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4ODAzNjU4Njg1NTU2NDg3/bitcoin_alpha_press_release.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>Disclaimer: BTC Inc. is the parent company of both Bitcoin Magazine and Bitcoin Amsterdam.</em></p><p>Bitcoin Magazine PRO and the Samara Asset Group have announced the Bitcoin Alpha competition, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at discovering the next top bitcoin fund manager.

Instead, it serves as a marketplace where firms can execute trades. This eliminates the risk of bank-run style failings that the industry witnessed in 2022 with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and others.</p><p>The development comes just as American exchange <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/coinbase-sued-by-the-sec-for-securities-violations">Coinbase</a> and worldwide exchange <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sec-sues-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-alleging-securities-laws-violations">Binance</a> face lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the crackdown indicated increasing scrutiny from regulators, it seems that larger institutions are viewing this as an opportunity to swoop in for market share. These firms often have close ties to regulators and are much more effective at complying with regulations as a result of their scale, and as such, the current environment is seemingly ripe for disruption.</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">a recent filing by BlackRock</a>, the world’s largest asset management firm with more than $8 trillion under management, for a spot Bitcoin ETF is another sign that these institutions see the current environment as an opportunity for expansion into the sector. </p><p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has repeatedly <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1541421073262120960?s=20">claimed</a> that bitcoin is <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1629573858104582144?s=20">not a security</a>, but a commodity, effectively keeping it out of the realm of SEC regulation. As a result, institutions like BlackRock may perceive bitcoin to be the safest cryptocurrency to offer products for, although this newly announced EDX exchange will feature other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><p>Overall, the development indicates that BlackRock is not the sole major traditional finance institution paying attention to bitcoin — everyone wants their slice of the pie, and regulators have served up that pie fresh out of the oven.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDg4MTA1ODc5ODczMDI5/economic-chart-analysis.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Brink Renews Grant For Sebastian Falbesoner's Review Of BIP324 To Enhance Bitcoin's Censorship-Resistance]]></title><description><![CDATA[The focus of Falbesoner’s work seeks to bring greater privacy to Bitcoin node operators through encryption.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/brink-renews-grant-for-sebastian-falbesoners-review-of-bip324</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/brink-renews-grant-for-sebastian-falbesoners-review-of-bip324</guid><category><![CDATA[brink]]></category><category><![CDATA[encryption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Grants]]></category><category><![CDATA[Privacy]]></category><category><![CDATA[development]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bip]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxOTg4NDM3NTk3ODg5OTkx/20220830_better-the-four-pillars-of-bitcoin-adoption---stefan-ristic.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin research and development center, Brink, has <a href="https://brink.dev/blog/2023/06/20/bip324/">announced</a> the renewal of a year-long grant for Sebastian Falbesoner, also known as theStack. “As part of his grant renewal application, he emphasized the importance of BIP324 Version 2 P2P transport and why he plans to spend his review time on the project,” the announcement read.</p><p>BIP324 aims to address the vulnerability of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) communication layer, where messages are currently transmitted unencrypted. Sebastian highlights the need for opportunistic encryption between Bitcoin nodes to combat censorship, privacy breaches, and other attacks. He explains, "BIP324 tries to counter these deficiencies by adding opportunistic encryption between Bitcoin nodes, making it significantly harder for adversaries to conduct these attacks."</p><p>The proposal incorporates a protocol that obscures the initiation of connections between peers, ensuring minimal information is revealed to external observers. This is achieved through the use of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/759.pdf#page=25">ElligatorSwift</a>, a modern elliptic curve point encoding scheme. Additionally, an extra chunk of random bytes, known as "garbage," is exchanged during connection initiation to further obfuscate the size of packets, hindering detection by potential attackers.</p><p>Sebastian expressed his fascination with BIP324's pseudorandom approach, stating, "If we imagine a world where this v2 encrypted transport protocol is used predominantly ... censorship of any Bitcoin participant on the network level will be significantly harder." He highlights that deep packet inspection and man-in-the-middle attacks would become far more challenging to execute.</p><p>Recognizing the significance of BIP324 for ensuring Bitcoin's censorship-resistance on the P2P layer, Brink has extended Sebastian's part-time grant for another year. Sebastian plans to conduct thorough code reviews, test the remaining BIP324 pull requests, and run a publicly accessible BIP324-compatible node once a functional pull request is available.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxOTg4NDM3NTk3ODg5OTkx/20220830_better-the-four-pillars-of-bitcoin-adoption---stefan-ristic.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Is Actually A Store Of Energy, And That Changes Everything]]></title><description><![CDATA[Serving as a currency backed by energy of any source, bitcoin has solved problems that have been tied to money throughout history.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-currency-that-stores-energy-unlocking-the-future</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-currency-that-stores-energy-unlocking-the-future</guid><category><![CDATA[energy consumption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fiat]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[The history of money]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shane Neagle]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMzg0NjM5NzQwOTQ2MDc3/20220916_better-five-factors-making-bitcoin-miners-unique-energy-consumers---jaran-mellerud.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Shane Neagle, the editor-in-chief of “The Tokenist.”</em></p><p>Time and time again, we see the mainstream media <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">taking advantage</a> of Bitcoin’s perceived exploit: energy consumption. For the Bitcoin network, this path has become all too familiar.</p><p>Just look at what happened in May 2021, when Elon Musk effectively “broke” bitcoin’s price as Tesla <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">announced</a> it would no longer accept BTC as payment, citing environmental concerns. The price of a single bitcoin <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/13/bitcoin-tesla-elon-musk-climate/">dropped by nearly $8,000</a> in the two hours following the announcement. There are countless similar cases as well.</p><p>But the takeaway is this: It’s very clear that the perception of Bitcoin’s fundamentals goes far beyond the security of the network, the soundness of the code and the asset’s limited supply. Bitcoin’s energy consumption plays a role, too. So big of a role, that it significantly impacts not just the price of bitcoin, but its regulatory framework as well. For better or for worse, this really can’t be argued.</p><p>But what if Bitcoin’s energy consumption was <em>actually</em> a good thing? What if Bitcoin functioned as a “store of energy” that provides a superior alternative to any monetary system we’ve ever seen?</p><p>Fortunately, the concept of an energy-backed currency is not as radical or novel as people may think — it has been around for more than a century. But the necessary conditions (i.e., the technology) did not yet exist to facilitate such a game-changing development for civilization.</p><p>That technology now exists, however, and it’s called Bitcoin. Let me explain.</p><h2>Money And ‘Life Energy’</h2><p>The evolution of human civilization largely centers upon the resolution of one key question: How do we appraise the true value of goods and services?</p><p>More specifically, how do we assess such value in the most uniform and effortless manner possible?</p><p>Consider the era of <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/the-bottom-line/managing-your-finances/a-history-of-the-trade-and-barter-system">ancient barter systems</a>, when a uniform system of fiat currency had yet to be conceived. Exchanging crops or livestock for services was commonplace. However, this system was fraught with inefficiencies, as it was heavily reliant on the mutual coincidence of wants. Consider a fisherman looking to trade his fish — but only for salt which he needed to preserve his future catch from spoiling. Any individual looking to trade for fish, must now have precisely what the fisherman wanted: salt.</p><p>In such a scenario, it’s easy to see how the principle of supply and demand is skewed.</p><p>Determining an equitable exchange for unique, non-fungible items poses a distinctive challenge. How do we ensure that both parties are duly rewarded for the energy they’ve invested — their “life energy” — in producing the product or service they’re selling?</p><p>This concept of “life energy” refers to the time, effort and creative energy that individuals pour into their work. Every human has a finite time span that they convert into tangible, productive output — a <em>measurable</em> form of energy.</p><p>But in this system of bartering, <em>life energy</em> isn’t appropriately accounted for. Rather, external factors heavily influence the value of a product or service — frequently to the detriment of the life energy devoted to its production.</p><p>Ideally, we need a system that allows for the accumulation and storage of this expenditure of energy — which we can refer to as “surplus energy” — and its associated value.</p><p>The advantages here go far beyond the individual who expended such energy. The metaphorical lifeblood of any economy is this concept of “surplus energy.” If this flow is impeded or clots, it leads to a less vibrant, stagnant economy. If it’s properly stored and fluid, it can lead to innovation and breakthroughs which benefit the society at large.</p><p>If we don't establish accurate mechanisms, capturing and storing surplus energy or value becomes impossible.</p><p>Hence, it becomes vital to measure this energy output in the most streamlined manner possible, to ensure fair compensation for — and ability to capitalize on — the energy expended. In this respect, a significant landmark in civilization’s journey was the evolution from bartering to commodity money, eventually leading to the use of portable, interchangeable and standardized metal coins.</p><h2>A Historical Devaluation Of Life Energy</h2><p>The Roman Empire built itself on economic efficiency by minimizing money friction. Its blood was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">denarius currency</a>, molded out of the limited supply of precious metals. The limited nature of the denarius allowed for it to serve as a store of value.</p><p>Concurrently, the denarius’ portability as a store of value allowed it to spread across every corner of the empire, easily transported and traded by various merchants. Consequently, the economic circulatory system <a href="https://www.moneymuseum.com/en/for-sunflower/the-fall-of-the-roman-denarius-460">overflowed with energy</a>. As the friction within the exchange of goods and services was minimized, new specialized labor markets could form, which increased productivity and innovation.</p><p>In monetary terms, all was good. The Roman civilization achieved a commodity currency which facilitated economic expansion. Such a standardized currency, portable and limited as it was, stored and efficiently captured Roman energy into productivity and economic growth. </p><p>Until it didn't, by decree.</p><p>As each Roman emperor desired to expend more energy than the currency allowed, they started to erode the denarri’s store of value. </p><p>The denarius remained portable and fungible, yet it began to falter in its ability to accurately represent people's life energy outputs. The silver content of each denarius became smaller and smaller, eroding the currency’s ability to maintain value and, ultimately, purchasing power.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Today, we understand this as inflation. With each currency debasement cycle, people lost confidence that their life’s energy output was properly measured, quite <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/how-does-money-supply-affect-inflation.asp">similar to what’s happening today</a>:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The United States is in a peculiar historic position in which <a href="https://kenaninstitute.unc.edu/kenan-insight/how-the-u-s-exports-inflation-through-a-strong-dollar/">it can export domestic inflation</a> thanks to the status of the dollar as the global reserve currency (GRC). Therefore, wages can keep growing at an inflationary pace. But, <a href="https://tokenist.com/the-us-debt-ceiling-crisis-explained/">as debt ceilings have become debt ladders</a>, no one knows for sure for how long this will be sustainable.</p><p>And it is definitely not sustainable in many other countries with double- and even <a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/triple-digit-inflation/">triple-digit</a> inflation rates.</p><h2>Money: What Needs To Be Fixed?</h2><p>So, what patterns can we observe from our monetary history?</p><p>First, to properly measure life’s energy outputs, the gauge needs to be fungible and standardized, facilitating a feasible calculation of the value of nonfungible goods and services. Second, the gauge needs to simultaneously <em>store value</em> and <em>be</em> <em>portable</em>.</p><p>These baseline elements provide people with a tool to accurately transform their limited time and energy — life energy — into a productive, well-compensated energy output.</p><p>When we look at all modern fiat currencies, their stores of value rest on shaky grounds. The problem is, central banks have replaced emperors — but their decrees are no less disruptive.</p><p>At a fundamental level, the exchange of funds between employers and employees is the exchange of energy. But neither employers nor employees control this compensatory energy’s current(cy). That energy’s current is provided through <em>currency</em> — and it’s entirely controlled by central banks.</p><p>Thus, it is central banks that uniquely possess the authority to modify that energy current over time, echoing the practice of ancient Roman emperors.</p><p>The biggest influence on a currency’s store of value is its supply and issuance schedule. Central banks and Roman emperors alike have had a tendency to radically change available supply, negatively impacting this attribute.</p><p>In turn, this negatively impacts people’s ability to capitalize on their expended energy.</p><h2>Energy Currency As New Milestone Technology</h2><p>From bartering and commodities, to metal coins and fiat paper currency, history’s monetary experiments have delivered actionable conclusions. </p><p>Alongside portability, maintaining the integrity of the currency’s store of value is of the utmost importance. For this to be achievable, it must not rely on arbitrary decrees.</p><p>And this is precisely the revolution Satoshi Nakamoto brought with his <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>. The trust must be removed from the centralized entities which have complete control over monetary systems — and the ability for individuals to capitalize on their expended energy through labor: “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,” as Nakamoto <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">put it</a>.</p><p>The question then shifts to: How do we <em>secure</em> that new component of trust?</p><p>Past intellectuals have argued for backing money with units of energy. Namely, in John Maynard Keynes’ <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/collected-writings-of-john-maynard-keynes/keyness-early-lectures/37A3CBC28BAA6C04725F688B410E3E5D">lectures of 1912 to 1913</a>, which provided the intellectual framework for a means of measuring money “in terms of units of electrical energy.”</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin: An Energy-Secured System Of Energy Transference</h2><p>In the case of Bitcoin, that new component of trust is secured through <em>energy</em>.</p><p>Bitcoin is not only portable but digitally portable, complementing our digital era. It’s not merely scarce, but its scarcity is defined in an energy-agnostic way. This links back to Ford’s dream of an energy-backed currency, but with a fundamental difference. Ford’s envisioned energy currency, tied to the world’s largest power plant, would have been susceptible to vulnerabilities associated with centralization. In contrast, Bitcoin leverages energy from any source available.</p><p>The decentralized nature of computing power creates a resilient and robust system. It is through this energy itself that the Bitcoin network secures this new component of trust — cryptographic proof.</p><p>In this light, it is no coincidence that <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1330150691671846919?lang=ta">Michael Saylor</a> paints the vision of Bitcoin as the solution to the problem of how to store energy over time and across space.</p><p>Returning to one of the first points mentioned, where Bitcoin’s perception goes beyond its own fundamentals, two questions remain: How durable should Bitcoin be to external factors? Are there any legitimate threats out there?</p><p>Just look at new technology which is developing at breakneck speeds. Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to heavily impact the finance world — from <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/book/rf-lit-review/2020/rflr-artificial-intelligence-in-asset-management.pdf">long-term investing</a> and portfolio management to <a href="https://thetradinganalyst.com/human-vs-ai-trading-signals/">shorter-term options trading</a>. Yet with the development and mass integration of AI, reality and illusion will become intertwined. Separating the two will become an arduous task.</p><p>How will such significant innovations impact Bitcoin?</p><p>Bitcoin is poised to endure such technological revolutions. The immutable nature of the blockchain allows for a degree of verifiability which the development of AI will create a greater need for. Yet even more importantly, Bitcoin advocates see how Bitcoin represents something of a vocation, rather than an asset merely for speculation and profit. This type of “larger than life” support will only help Bitcoin to endure life-changing innovations, political regime changes or any other existential “threat” that may arise in the future.</p><p>Yet there remains an ongoing absence of the proper framework when it comes to Bitcoin’s energy consumption, as I’ve tried to articulate here.</p><p>According to a recent poll, for example, <a href="https://www.creditdonkey.com/buy-bitcoin.html">76% of investors</a> want BTC to be more “environmentally friendly” — which misses the mark when it comes to the relationship between Bitcoin’s energy use (or, in other words, its means of securing the network) and our ability to effectively capitalize on the life energy we devote.</p><p>With its distinctive ability to store and transfer energy, the Bitcoin network fixes this dilemma.</p><p>Not only is the network secured by energy, but it has the potential to effectively enable individuals to properly capitalize on the use of their life energy. This means Bitcoin has already ventured into the unprecedented territory of an energy currency — not just for the benefit of the individual, but of society at large.</p><p>History is here and the journey has just begun.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

While Bitcoin Layer 2 options like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> offer low transaction fees, it may not be practical for Bitcoin hodlers to migrate their entire holdings to Lightning, as many Lightning wallets are custodial, meaning users must rely on a trusted third party to hold their funds. While this custodial approach may be suitable for small amounts that users are likely to spend, many Bitcoiners will feel uneasy about not having self-custody of their bitcoin. Additionally, achieving self-custody of a substantial stack on Lightning would require significant technical knowledge and still necessitate dealing with the Bitcoin timechain. However, the appeal of low transaction fees has driven some Bitcoiners to explore alternative solutions.</p><p>A particular challenge faced by Bitcoiners who follow a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) stacking strategy is withdrawing small amounts, ranging from $5 to $100 worth of bitcoin, from exchanges to the timechain. This practice often leads to a buildup of numerous and small unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), complicating coin control management and potentially leading to higher fees when combining UTXO inputs for larger transactions. Consequently, alternative low-fee options have emerged to address this issue.</p><p><a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000630846-How-do-I-get-Liquid-Bitcoin-L-BTC-">Liquid-Bitcoin (L-BTC)</a> on Blockstream's <a href="https://blockstream.com/liquid/">Liquid sidechain</a> and <a href="https://wbtc.network/">wrapped bitcoin (WBTC)</a>, an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, are two prominent alternatives that aim to enhance liquidity and functionality while, in theory, minimizing transaction fees. Let's delve into the differences between L-BTC and WBTC, as well as the pros and cons of each:</p><h2>Liquid-Bitcoin (L-BTC) On Blockstream's Liquid Sidechain:</h2><ul><li>L-BTC operates on the Liquid sidechain, which is a separate blockchain built on top of the Bitcoin network.</li><li>Liquid employs a <a href="https://liquid.net/">federated consensus</a> model, where a group of trusted functionaries validate transactions on the Liquid network.</li><li>L-BTC facilitates interblockchain transactions with other assets issued on the Liquid sidechain, providing <a href="https://blog.liquid.net/the-truth-about-liquid/">enhanced privacy features and confidential transactions</a>.</li><li>Pros of L-BTC: Faster transaction confirmations due to shorter block times, improved privacy features, compatibility with other assets on the Liquid sidechain, and the ability to leverage Bitcoin's liquidity in cross-chain transactions. Participants in the network can <a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900002026026-How-do-I-set-up-a-Liquid-node-">run their own node</a> to <a href="https://blockstream.com/assets/downloads/pdf/liquid-whitepaper.pdf">verify proof-of-reserves</a> and <a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000632703-How-do-I-peg-in-BTC-to-the-Liquid-Network-">peg in their bitcoin into Liquid without the need for a federated third-party member</a>. <a href="https://blog.liquid.net/the-truth-about-liquid/">Liquid does not perform KYC / AML procedures for users to obtain L-BTC</a>.</li><li><em>Cons of L-BTC:</em> Reliance on a federated consensus model, limited availability of “decentralized” applications compared to Ethereum, and the need for trust in the functionaries. Additionally, users <a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001551783-What-is-a-Liquid-peg-out-">require a federated third-party member to peg out from Liquid to the main chain</a>.</li></ul><h2>Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) On Ethereum:</h2><ul><li>Originally jointly initiated by <a href="https://kyber.network/">Kyber</a>, <a href="https://www.bitgo.com/newsroom/press-releases/wbtc-brings-bitcoin-to-ethereum">BitGo</a>, and the now defunct <a href="https://twitter.com/renprotocol/status/1600559366440390657">Republic Protocol (REN)</a>, WBTC is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing Ethereum's smart contract functionality to lock up bitcoin and issue WBTC tokens.</li><li>WBTC's governance involves <a href="https://wbtc.network/dashboard/partners">multiple entities</a> that form part of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), merchants who provide liquidity, a single custodian, <a href="https://www.bitgo.com/">BitGo</a>, who holds the bitcoin reserves, and token holders who participate in voting.</li><li>WBTC benefits from the extensive Ethereum ecosystem (if that’s what you’re into), enabling seamless interoperability with Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.</li><li><a href="https://www.securities.io/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin-wbtc-and-why-its-so-important/">Faster transaction transfers and cheaper fees</a> compared to Bitcoin’s main chain.</li><li>Pros of WBTC: Integration with the Ethereum ecosystem, wider availability of so-called “decentralized” applications, <a href="https://wbtc.network/assets/wrapped-tokens-whitepaper.pdf">decentralized governance involving multiple stakeholders</a>, and the ability to leverage Bitcoin's liquidity within the Ethereum network.</li><li>Cons of WBTC: Slower transaction confirmations and higher fees during network congestion on the Ethereum network, reliance on a single custodial entity for holding bitcoin reserves, and the need to trust the custodian. In contrast to L-BTC, WBTC carries less certain counterparty risk, as its governance is not as well defined. You cannot run your own node, and peg ins and peg outs are solely dependent on the WBTC merchants. Finally, WBTC <a href="https://wbtc.network/">merchants are required to perform KYC / AML procedures to verify the user’s identity</a>.</li><li><em>Note: </em>WBTC has some limited use for those using the <a href="https://wbtc.network/dashboard/order-book/wbtc-tron">Tron protocol</a>.</li></ul><p>Regarding possible failures or potential risks, it's important to note that both L-BTC and WBTC rely on trusted intermediaries and custodians for their operations. Failures in custody, governance, or regulatory compliance could pose risks to users' funds or the stability of these systems. While there have been no major reported failures, risks exist and users should exercise caution and perform due diligence when engaging with L-BTC or WBTC.</p><p>It bears noting that 11 of the 15 Liquid Federation functionaries would need to collude in bad faith to rug-pull users from their pegged-in bitcoin, thereby, reducing the possibility of acting in bad faith. The way by which a rug-pull would take place in WBTC is less certain, but with only a single custodian of their locked-in BTC, a central point of failure is one of WBTC’s major weaknesses. What is evident is that for both L-BTC and WBTC, there are increased risk trade-offs from self-custody.</p><p>From a Bitcoin-only perspective, using L-BTC or WBTC may raise ethical implications, as it could be seen as deviating from the original vision of Bitcoin as a standalone, decentralized network. Bitcoiners could argue that tokenizing Bitcoin undermines the core principles of the network and introduces additional risks and complexities. They emphasize the importance of Bitcoin's sovereignty, security, and censorship resistance.</p><p>However, proponents of L-BTC and WBTC may contend that tokenized versions of bitcoin can enhance liquidity, scaling, and functionality, thus benefiting the overall ecosystem. Both tokens could be alternatives that allow bitcoin hodlers to access the advantages of other blockchain networks — such as faster transaction confirmations, interoperability with dApps, and additional financial instruments.</p><p>WBTC has an advantage over L-BTC when accessing other crypto ecosystems and activity. However, Blockstream's Liquid Network provides a platform where L-BTC can be exchanged for various digital assets, including stablecoins like <a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005355626-How-do-I-get-Liquid-based-Tether-USDt-">USDT (tether)</a> and <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/en-bull-bitcoin-launches-l-cad-on-the-liquid-network/">L-CAD (Canadian dollar-denominated gift certificates issued by Bull Bitcoin)</a>. This feature enables users to access different digital assets and expands their options for trading, remittances, and other financial activities within the Liquid ecosystem.</p><p>Additionally, as per previous announcements, <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/el-salvador-to-issue-1b-in-tokenized-bonds-on-the-liquid-network/">the Liquid Network will be utilized for the issuance of the El Salvador Bitcoin Bond</a> (recently amended to a <a href="https://youtu.be/DnlA1vyxRBc?t=917">Volcano Mining Equity</a>). This demonstrates the network's capability to facilitate the issuance and management of tokenized financial instruments, further expanding the use cases beyond simple asset exchange.</p><p>Everything considered, L-BTC is a superior option compared to WBTC due to its distinct advantages over transaction fees and the speed of transfer times. While WBTC relies on the Ethereum (and Tron) network, which are prone to frequent <a href="https://crypto.news/ethereum-gas-fees-spike-to-a-one-year-high-amidst-pepe-craze/">congestion issues and high fees</a>, L-BTC provides faster and more cost-effective transactions. By leveraging the Liquid Network, L-BTC offers low fees, quicker confirmations, and improved scalability, making it a more efficient and practical solution for willing bitcoin holders. With L-BTC, users can enjoy the benefits of Bitcoin's main chain while bypassing the limitations and challenges associated with WBTC on the Ethereum network.</p><p>To make the most of L-BTC for the purpose of low fees, it is well-suited for short-term and medium-term holding strategies.</p><h2>Three-Step Process To Leverage The Benefits Of L-BTC</h2><ol><li>Withdrawal from exchange to L-BTC: There are a number of <a href="https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000629383">exchanges which support L-BTC</a> and allow you to withdraw directly to a wallet that supports L-BTC (<a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Green Wallet</a> or <a href="https://aquawallet.io/">Aqua</a>). This allows you to bypass additional conversions or transfers, ensuring that you retain the advantages of L-BTC throughout the process. An additional advantage is an option to store L-BTC in cold storage with a hardware device such as <a href="https://blockstream.com/jade/">Blockstream Jade</a>.</li><li>Wait for ideal UTXO denomination: Keep adding to your L-BTC stack until you accumulate a sufficient amount of satoshis to create a desirable unspent transaction output (UTXO) denomination. This step helps optimize coin control and simplifies future transactions.</li><li>Peg out using SideSwap or a similar service: When transaction fees are low you should peg out to reappropriate the funds back to the Bitcoin main chain. You can utilize a service like <a href="https://sideswap.io/">SideSwap</a>, which facilitates the conversion of L-BTC to BTC, taking into account the <a href="https://sideswap.io/faq/fees/">conversion fee of around 0.1%</a>. It's important to consider this fee when planning your transactions to ensure accurate cost calculations.</li></ol><p>By following this flow, you can effectively utilize L-BTC for short-term and medium-term hodling, and take advantage of its low fees and faster transaction confirmations. This approach can be particularly useful in a permanent high-fees environment, where L-BTC offers a cost-effective solution compared to on-chain Bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Currently, popular Bitcoin exchanges like Swan, Strike, CoinCorner, Relai, Amber, River and Bitonic do not currently have support for L-BTC withdrawals. However, just like many have integrated Lightning withdrawals, they will likely respond to a demand for L-BTC.</p><p>For Bitcoin hodlers seeking an alternative to the main chain, L-BTC offers a compelling option compared to WBTC on Ethereum. L-BTC's advantage lies in its utilization of bitcoin itself, ensuring a closer alignment with the principles and vision of the Bitcoin network. By leveraging L-BTC, users can benefit from faster confirmations, enhanced privacy features, and compatibility with other assets on the Liquid sidechain. From the perspective of preserving the integrity of Bitcoin's core principles, L-BTC stands as a preferable choice for Bitcoin hodlers seeking alternative low-fee options while maintaining a direct connection to the Bitcoin network.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4Nzc2MTkxODMyODI3MjQz/liquid-bitcoin-versus-wrapped-bitcoin-feature-image-w_text.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ordinals-Focused Infighting Is Bad For Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Ditch the wizard hats, and turn off the laser eyes.

    </figure><p>Over the last few weeks, I’ve noticed a disappointing trend that has divided the Bitcoin community into two warring factions. On one side, the “Bitcoin transaction maximalists” believe that Bitcoin Layer 1 should be used purely to process transactions. On the other side of the spectrum, the “Ordinal enjoooyers” want to use Bitcoin’s Layer 1 to inscribe arbitrary data and generally want to experiment with the base layer.</p><p>I personally don’t have a dog in this fight. I think both sides make compelling arguments for their use cases. The purpose of this article isn’t to say one is right and the other side is wrong, it is to raise the alarm about what happens if the infighting continues and how this could hinder the movement.</p><h2>Sympathy For Bitcoin Transaction Maximalists</h2><p>The current schism in the Bitcoin community appeared right when Ordinals showed up on the scene in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals">January 2023</a>. The Ordinals protocol essentially allowed for NFTs on Bitcoin. Until then, NFTs were generally left to the Ethereum crowd and their ilk. Ordinals changed that dynamic and brought the creators who were minting NFTs on Ethereum to Bitcoin, and this new influx brought new developers and, of course, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">higher transaction fees</a>.</p><p>As we all know, the Bitcoin blockchain is not optimized for speed. This is why we have the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 solutions. The purpose of mainchain Bitcoin is to transfer value ultra securely and consistently.<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/"> </a>The Bitcoin network <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/">has an uptime of 99.98%</a>, which is a remarkable achievement. This is exactly what we want in a base money that can be trusted: not to debase over time.</p><p>When new participants come into the Bitcoin ecosystem and want to transact on the network, inevitably, transaction fees are going to go up. It comes down to the simple issue of supply and demand. With every block, there is only a limited amount of block space, so users have to compete to get their transaction into the next block.</p><p>This leads to users getting outbid and having their transaction action languish in the mempool or priced out of sending a transaction in the first place.</p><p>As someone who is lucky enough to live in the Western world, this isn’t a huge deal for me because I can wait for transaction fees to come back down. Many users in the global south don’t have that same luxury.</p><p>They are using Bitcoin as a monetary network to conduct day-to-day business, so Layer 1 fee spikes are a detriment to their daily survivals. This is where I am sympathetic to the argument that Bitcoin should be primarily used for transactions.</p><h2>Sympathy For Bitcoin Ordinal Enjoooyers</h2><p>But the rules are the rules, and Ordinals follow the parameters of Bitcoin. Since Ordinals launched, there has undoubtedly been an explosion of activity on the Bitcoin network. Before Ordinals, transactions could be sent for pennies, but after Ordinals,<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ordinals-upend-bitcoin-mining-pushing-224350412.html"> fees spiked to over $19.20 in May 2023.</a> This represents a 560% increase.</p><p>Obviously, this is a massive spike in fees, but on the flip side, it has shown the Bitcoin community that fees can replace the block subsidy in time.<a href="https://decrypt.co/139345/bitcoin-transaction-fees-surpass-block-rewards"> With block 788,695, for instance, there was 6.7 BTC in fees</a>, versus the standing block subsidy of 6.25 BTC.</p><p>Ultimately this is what we want to happen, but from what I can venture to guess, Bitcoin transaction maximalists didn’t want this to happen so early in the Bitcoin adoption cycle. Considering how early we are, I can see why they would be upset with the Ordinal enjoooyers.</p><p>Many of these maximalists think Ordinals enjoooyers are nothing but degenerate altcoiners, bringing their garbage to the Bitcoin network and clogging it up with monkey pics and d**k butts. Fair point, there is some of that going on. But there is nothing that can be done about it.</p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone, right? It is permissionless, and people can do whatever they want with Bitcoin as long as it doesn’t violate the rules. </p><p>But this tension in Bitcoin right now is creating two distinct camps in Bitcoin, which is sad to see because we should be united in the mission of getting the world on a Bitcoin standard.</p><h2>We Are The Emissaries For Bitcoin</h2><p>The division between the pro-Ordinal and anti-Ordinal camps mainly existed on Bitcoin Twitter, but it definitely came to a head at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami. </p><p>If you watched the “Great Ordinals Debate,” you saw the tension from the get go. Both camps, represented by speakers on stage, came out swinging against each other, accusing one another of harming Bitcoin and Bitcoin adoption:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdYsQ2DWt5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>The debate came off as childish, and the arguing over BRC-20 tokens was little more than a sideshow. This schism was the front that was presented for the world to see, four guys arguing over something the general public doesn’t understand. Perception is everything right now, and if the goal is to onboard billions of people around the world, arguing over wizard pictures and obscure protocols isn’t the way to go.</p><p>In my view, this debate highlighted the struggle for the soul of Bitcoin right now. What does it mean to be a Bitcoiner? How should the network be used? Do Bitcoiners get to tell other Bitcoiners how to use the network? </p><p>These are questions that will probably continue to come up as long as Bitcoin exists and other use cases are created for Bitcoin.</p><p>I don’t like the infighting on Bitcoin Twitter or at the conference as it makes the Bitcoin industry look bad and like it isn’t ready for the big leagues. How can bitcoin become the world’s reserve currency when we don’t have our own house in order? Don’t s**t where you eat, guys. We are the emissaries for Bitcoin, and we should always be cautious of how Bitcoin is shown to the world.</p><p>The mission of Bitcoin is to offer a better alternative to the world and take away the power from the people who corrupt society with fiat currency. The powers that be won’t take Bitcoin seriously until we get serious numbers of people adopting it. If we want to change the world, the community needs to stay focused and presentable to a wider public. Ditch the wizard hats, and turn off the laser eyes. We are all on the same team and working toward the same goal. Let’s not forget what brought us to Bitcoin. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

However, there is still space for banking in a Bitcoin world; though a variation from the system with which we are currently familiar. </p><p>Caitlin Long has tirelessly fought for sound banking practices especially as it relates to the dangers of leverage in bitcoin.

She has been met with senseless <a href="https://custodiabank.com/press/custodia-stands-firm-in-response-to-the-fed/">opposition</a> from the Federal Reserve during this process, but Long has met these setbacks with stoicism, professionalism and integrity and continues to fight for Fed access for Custodia through a lengthy court battle. </p><p>It was a privilege to interview Long about her outlook on the Bitcoin space and the future of finance, and I know you will find her responses insightful.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what <em>specifically</em> drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I first learned about it in 2012 from alternative schools of economic thought. I was a member of an email group and started noticing people talking about it back then. For those who are not familiar with alternative schools of economic thought, Bitcoin has sparked a lot of interest within the various schools of thought. For example, those who follow Austrian School economics would generally see bitcoin as a digital version of gold due to its limited supply and decentralized nature. It’s an alternative store of value. They also would argue that, because Bitcoin is apolitical and deflationary in nature, it is a better alternative to fiat currencies that are dependent on inflationary monetary policy. </p><p>There are several other arguments to be made surrounding Bitcoin and alternative schools of economic thought, but we don’t have the time to get into those.<br></p><p><strong>As a leader in the Bitcoin banking sector, you have seen the highs and lows of policy in the U.S. Do you think Custodia will eventually be granted a Fed membership and account?</strong></p><p>I will have to let the lawsuit speak for itself regarding Custodia. However, I am optimistic regarding the policy issue generally. The people in power in Washington, D.C. today think they have the power to kill Bitcoin, which should give all of us a good laugh. Bitcoin has already died <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/">474 </a>deaths and it still lives — it’s just code, and 8 billion people in the world already have the capability to run code on their smartphones. When organizations make decisions out of fear, they tend to get exactly what they feared. U.S. policymakers are going to get what they fear here as a result of pushing Bitcoin services into the proverbial shadows: they will face a stronger, more globally-distributed and therefore more resilient Bitcoin network, over which they have less visibility and control over U.S. dollar on-/off-ramps than they have today.</p><p><strong>Do you see bitcoin as an asset that will help to keep the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency? Or as a means to an apolitical monetary system globally?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are definitely strategic and national security benefits to the United States maintaining its leadership in this technology. Yes, dollars can be issued on the Lightning Network, for example, and the United States should embrace this. The fact that stablecoins gained as much traction as they have is a testament to the world wanting the dollar to run on internet-speed payment rails.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is a tough question, and it is broader than just Bitcoin. It applies to the tech sector as a whole, as well as to the STEM fields generally. It’s no secret that I funded a scholarship for female engineers at the University of Wyoming in 2017 with appreciated bitcoin. In doing this, I am trying my best to encourage women to stay in the engineering field once they matriculate in an engineering major. </p><p>Aside from women speaking out, the best thing the Bitcoin space can do to attract more women, and indeed people of all backgrounds, is to keep adding blocks. Adoption will continue over time!</p><h2>Afterword</h2><p>There is a fair bit of irony in the fact that Long and the team at Custodia are doing things in the most compliant way possible and yet they are experiencing resistance from deep within the banking regulatory establishment. The concept of fully-reserved deposits just does not compute with banking regulators due to decades of indoctrination at the altar of debt and rehypothecation. Pioneers like Long deserve not only our respect, but also our support as they are the first ones into the breach. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

However, my journey has also revealed the true costs of overlooking privacy in bitcoin transactions. </p><p>Through firsthand experiences and lessons learned, I've come to appreciate the paramount importance of protecting personal information and maximizing privacy levels. In this article, I will share my insights on the perils of sacrificing privacy in Bitcoin transactions and the steps I've taken to reclaim control over my financial freedom.</p><h2>The Price Of Transparent Transactions</h2><p>My initial enthusiasm for Bitcoin's privacy potential was met with a harsh reality: without the appropriate privacy measures, my transactions were anything but anonymous. I felt that this made the risk of theft loom large, as hackers could identify and target wallets holding substantial sums of bitcoin. Witnessing others<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/18/history-of-bitcoin-hacks-alternative-currency"> fall victim to these attacks</a> made me realize the grave financial losses that could result from a lack of privacy.</p><p>And beyond my individual concerns, I began to feel that neglecting privacy in bitcoin transactions held broader societal implications. When transactions lack anonymity, they can become tools for profiling and targeting individuals for various purposes. This erosion of privacy could in turn breed a loss of trust in Bitcoin, as users are likely seeking a more secure and permissionless alternative to the fiat monetary system. Bitcoin's true potential can only be realized when privacy is given the importance it deserves.</p><h2>Reclaiming Privacy And Financial Freedom</h2><p>Awakening to the costs of negligence, I made a conscious decision to reclaim control over my financial privacy. I took some proactive steps to protect my personal information and enhance my privacy levels. Here are the strategies I adopted:</p><ol><li>Embracing privacy-enhancing technologies: I employed a virtual private network (VPN) and Tor to encrypt my internet traffic and shield my identity, making it more challenging for prying eyes to track my online activity.</li><li>Harnessing <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-are-bitcoin-mixers">CoinJoin and Whirlpool</a>: CoinJoin technology, particularly through solutions like Whirlpool, allowed me to mix my bitcoin transactions with those of others, significantly bolstering my privacy and making it arduous for outsiders to trace my bitcoin activity.</li><li>Labeling and management: By meticulously managing my unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), I decoupled my transaction history, embraced stealth addresses and exercised coin control, enhancing my overall privacy.</li><li>Breaking the address reuse habit: I committed myself to avoiding address reuse, opting for unique addresses for each bitcoin transaction that I conduct. This simple yet crucial practice minimized the ability of others to track and monitor my bitcoin transactions.</li><li>Peer-to-peer purchases: To minimize the exposure of my personal information and transaction details, I shifted towards peer-to-peer transactions instead of relying solely on exchanges.</li><li>Mindful information sharing: I became vigilant about the personal information I shared online, understanding that every piece of data could be exploited to identify and track my financial activities. Utilizing pseudonyms and aliases whenever possible shielded my identity.</li></ol><h2>Reclaiming Control</h2><p>Through my own experiences, I've witnessed the true cost of sacrificing privacy in bitcoin transactions. However, by taking proactive measures to protect my personal information and enhance my privacy levels, I've reclaimed control over my financial freedom. </p><p>Bitcoin's promise of decentralization, security and pseudonymity can only be fully realized when we prioritize and safeguard our privacy. Let us stand together, empowered by the knowledge that protecting our assets and privacy leads to a more secure and liberated future.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Prasad Prabhakaran.

Captains had been struggling with poor navigation since the onset of global trade. Though sailors could easily measure latitude by gauging the sun’s height, longitude was very hard to determine and inapt techniques veered vessels of course. Without visual bearings, humans were sailing blind on the open seas. The increased travel time led to scurvy, delays and ships smashing on the rocks — losing crew and cargo forever to the deep.<br><br>Fortunately, a genius Brit came up with the solution — the <em>chronometer</em>, a clock that could keep its beat on the volatile seas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison">John Harrison</a> was this genius and his invention outperformed crude astronomical techniques that relied on clear skies, number tables and hours of calculation. There was no second best. <br><br>But his innovation wasn’t adopted!<br><br>According to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_(book)">Longitude</a>” by Dava Sobel, it took until 1828 for the Board of Longitude to be disbanded and the chronometer to reach mass adoption.<br><br>Why on Earth did it take so long?</p><h2>Going Beyond The S Curve</h2><blockquote><p>“...the diffusion of innovations is a social process, even more than a technical one.”<br></p><p>–Everett M. Rogers, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Another timekeeping device was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is a decentralized clock in cyberspace enabling accurate economic calculation and financial navigation in the uncertain waters of life. Though its properties are superior in the eyes of its users, the rate of adoption is not as spectacular.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Many claim it’s at the brink of crossing the chasm: “This is the internet of 1995!” But in our bullishness, we expected an <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-iphone-users#:~:text=Statista%2C%20The%20Verge-,What%20Percentage%20of%20People%20Have%20iPhones%3F,at%207.33%20billion%20in%202023.">iPhone-like adoption</a>. Certainly, ideas spread faster than ever before, but to consider this trend as the sole variable governing adoption rate is oversimplifying it. The longitude story shows us that, even when an innovation is a complete no-brainer, it may take longer than you think to catch on.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Rogers’ adopter categories (blue) and the S curve of cumulative adoption (orange). </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations"><em>Source</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Everett Rogers was the social scientist who popularized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations">observation of how innovations diffuse across the social medium by a normal distribution</a>. By aggregating adopters over time, the uptake looks like an S curve that hockey-sticks upward after a <em>critical mass</em> of users has been reached. This model gained popularity early this century as it explained the exponential growth of mobile phones and the internet.</p><p>But Rogers’ research encompasses more than just this memorable model. In his book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diffusion-Innovations-5th-Everett-Rogers/dp/0743222091">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>,” he discerned five parameters that govern a technology’s adoption rate.</p><h2>The Five Perceived Attributes Of Bitcoin</h2><h3>One: Relative Advantage</h3><blockquote><p>“Diffusion is a particular type of communication in which the message content that is exchanged is concerned with a new idea.”</p><p>–Rogers, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin’s perceived value is determined by two things: needs and price. <br><br>In order to have a need, one has to experience a problem. The issues with fiat money have long been recognized within the cypherpunk and sound money communities, and they were the first to adopt. But outside of these social cliques, the awareness of dollar debasement is low. A lack of financial education and fiat immersion leads people not to seek solutions. Without a <a href="https://bitcoin-graffiti.medium.com/emerald-city-syndrome-b554ee43945c">proper diagnosis</a>, nobody needs a cure. <br><br>Bitcoin’s price is slowing adoption and unit bias makes the coin look expensive. People don’t know it's subdividable. The price is also volatile, obfuscating its store-of-value function. You can contrast this with other adoption cases. For example, mobile phone users perceive value instantly — calling anyone, anytime, anywhere. But with Bitcoin, 80% drawdowns and “number go down” for years are not uncommon. It takes a high level of abstraction to see Bitcoin's value and high conviction not to be shaken out of the market.<br></p><h3>Two: Compatibility</h3><blockquote><p>“Potential adopters may not recognize that they have a need for an innovation until they become aware of the new idea or its consequences.”<br></p><p>–Rogers, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Diffusion Of Innovations</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The first version of a new technology is rarely a perfect match for the entire market, catering only to a niche group of innovators. According to Rogers, an innovation needs to be <em>reinvented</em> to find product-market fit. <br><br>Bitcoin is currently compatible with the financially educated. But beyond this group, Bitcoin is not perceived to be in line with people’s value and belief systems. It’s still a niche product in the innovator stage.<br><br>For Bitcoin to reach more early adopters, it has to be reinvented for different global markets. Currently, two distinct paths are emerging: its narrative and medium-of-exchange (MoE) usage. Here are three examples:</p><ol><li>“Banking the unbanked”: Bitcoin can help people in developing countries to leapfrog the legacy banking system. <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">Starlink</a> and smartphones enable adoption where an MoE, system for remittances and a bank account in your pocket have high value. Leaders in countries like <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1526029996787216387?lang=en">El Salvador</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKydH0bLA0k&amp;t=45s">Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUU8ms63-e4&amp;t=1463s">Indonesia</a> use such narratives to explain Nakamoto’s invention.</li><li>“Cyber warfare”: In his book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Softwar</a>,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery">Jason Lowery</a> uses military language to reinvent bitcoin as a geopolitical asset to be fought over by states in cyberspace, creating a new domain of war. Through the military lens, he recoins Bitcoin as “Bitpower,” creating a vision in which ASICs convert energy to raise a cryptographic wall, increasing the cost of attack on financial data. Lowery is a change agent, someone who translates Bitcoin to make it compatible with the U.S. army.</li><li>“Grid balancing”: This is the language for the energy sector clique. Proof-of-work mining can be used to make energy grids more resilient, balance supply and demand and turn a profit out of stranded energy sources.</li></ol><p>These narratives are designed to make Bitcoin more compatible with specific social groups that speak different languages. With increased understanding, these groups will drive the creation of new uses and applications.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Three: Complexity</h3><p>The chronometer was far ahead of its time and it took years before crafty entrepreneurs copied and manufactured the device. Similarly, Nakamoto had to introduce his invention to its first adopters on the <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/">Bitcoin Talk forum</a>. Since then, entrepreneurs have had to join and build services on top of the protocol, including cold storage solutions, mnemonic seed phrases and exchanges. These upgrades improved the user experience, but compared to the mobile phone, Bitcoin’s still relatively complicated.<br><br>This also holds true at Bitcoin’s development level. New software developers experience a steep barrier of entry implementing Bitcoin in applications — the ecosystem is not as well developed as regular web development. And while it’s true that Bitcoin is not what it was back in 2008, and upgrades continue to make it more accessible — with groups like <a href="https://lightningdevkit.org/">Spiral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk">Breeze</a> having recently launched software development kits to make integration easier, for instance — where is the Steve Jobs “boom” moment? </p><p>We are still waiting for the out-of-the-box killer app.&nbsp;</p><h3>Four: Trialability</h3><blockquote><p>“One must learn by doing the thing, for though you think you know it, you have no certainty until you try.</p><p>–Sophocles, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FylP8XOYd8oC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=%E2%80%9COne+must+learn+by+doing+the+thing,+for+though+you+think+you+know+it,+you+have+no+certainty+until+you+try.%22+sophocles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FjCEN6bW6Q&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Vw_aWYOdY6weUoGyotX2vP5jjOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjsse6_36z_AhV8j4kEHdl5BKAQ6AF6BAgGEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9COne%20must%20learn%20by%20doing%20the%20thing%2C%20for%20though%20you%20think%20you%20know%20it%2C%20you%20have%20no%20certainty%20until%20you%20try.%22%20sophocles&amp;f=false">The Trachiniae</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The chronometer had a long trial period. By the time captains could update their peers on improved navigation, months of trial and travel had passed. The device was deemed good only if it was accurate along the full sailing journey. On top of that, a ship was underway for months, retarding the word of mouth.<br><br>The Bitcoin journey takes time, too. Since price is volatile, it is not uncommon to be "under water" for some time. This can have an effect on the advantages perceived by the user, but may also deter peers from adopting. The trial period may be as long as the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769">reward halving</a>, and true advocates are only minted after enough time in the market.<br><br>Though trialability of Bitcoin is easy — one can just buy a little — the overall net benefit is only great with a larger purchase, proving the point that the full trial period might be as long as one halving.</p><h3>Five: Observability</h3><p>Bitcoin is digital and thus poorly visible. It is not like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T">Ford Model T</a> racing over the roads with its advantages on display. Most people only learn about Bitcoin in news reports when it has broken through its all-time highs, which can last only for a relatively-short duration.</p><p>Adoption speeds up with more visible applications. Perhaps in the not too distant future, Bitcoin miners may be integral parts of power plants and homes. People might send Bitcoin with their phones to friends on the street. Or they see the Lightning buttons on a <a href="http://iris.to/">Nostr client</a> and discover it’s possible to zap satoshis to their favorite influencers.<br><br>Also, increased wealth through bitcoin is hard to spot. Unless Bitcoiners start wearing Gucci and driving orange Lambos, rich HODLers are hard to observe. But wearing a giga-chad t-shirt might not be in vain and could potentially speed up the spread.</p><h2>Reward</h2><p>Harrison slaved away at his timekeeper alone for 20 years. His invention got blocked and retarded by bureaucracy, but he finally got his £20,000 bounty. Smart entrepreneurs were able to scale his ingenious design to mass production, bringing chronometers aboard ships where they saved time, cargo and lives. It took a long time, but the chronometer eventually floated to the top.<br><br>Today, the people of Earth are financially adrift. Like ships ignorant of longitude, they sail blindly through the treacherous waters of life, unable to financially calculate. We are barbarians living in the pre-science Stone Age of money. Future generations will look at us in dismay.<br><br>But this is about human psychology and how people embrace new ideas. In hindsight, world-changing technologies all appear self-evident. You’re right in the middle of a paradigm shift, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ignites-a-scientific-revolution">the ignition of scientific revolution</a>, and it is hard to see where things are going.<br><br>Bitcoin won’t diffuse rapidly like Facebook, the internet or the iPhone. Much needs to be built, reinvented and translated before the masses get onboard. Like with electricity, base layers are hard to grok without the actual appliances.<br><br>We will get there.<br><br>But it will take longer than you think.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Bitcoin Graffiti.

Among the concerning trends I have observed is the growing number of patients who not only suffer from poor health but also find themselves trapped in a cycle of financial struggle and dependency.</p><p>In this article, I will explore the connection between fiat currency and the emergence of what can be called "fiat people" — individuals with high time preferences, unhealthy lifestyles, poverty and an increasing inability to care for themselves. Additionally, I will delve into how Bitcoin offers a potential solution to these challenges. </p><h2>The Health Impacts Of Fiat Currency</h2><p>“Fiat currency” refers to a form of money that is not backed by a physical commodity such as gold or silver but is instead declared as legal tender by a government. This system allows for the creation of money by central banks and is based on trust in the issuing authority. While fiat currency has its advantages, such as flexibility and ease of transactions, its inherent characteristics have unintended consequences that impact individual behavior and society as a whole, including manufactured inflation and monetary debasement.</p><p>Fiat currency, with its characteristics that can be easily manipulated and inflated, fosters a culture of instant gratification and short-term thinking. When the value of money becomes uncertain, individuals are incentivized to spend rather than save. Consequently, people develop a high time preference, prioritizing immediate consumption over long-term planning and investment.</p><p>This mindset leads to detrimental effects on personal health and well-being. People are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as excessive consumption of processed foods, lack of exercise and neglect of preventive healthcare measures. The consequences of these choices manifest in a rise in chronic illnesses, obesity rates, mental health issues and substance abuse problems. Individuals who cannot afford to regularly eat local whole foods often rely on processed foods made with seed oils and other unnatural ingredients, leading to a downward spiral of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, renal failure, stroke and ultimately a complete dependence on the rest of society to care for them. </p><p>The prevalence of a high time preference perpetuated by fiat currency creates an environment where individuals fail to accumulate wealth and secure their financial futures. Continuous spending without proper savings leaves people vulnerable to unexpected expenses and economic downturns. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of their incomes, further exacerbating financial struggles. </p><p>Without the means to invest in education, acquire assets or start businesses, individuals are trapped in a cycle of poverty and limited economic mobility. Poverty, in turn, restricts access to quality healthcare, education and resources necessary for personal development, leading to a decline in overall well-being and increased dependence on external assistance.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is A Healthier Choice</h2><p>Recognizing the detrimental effects of fiat currency on individuals and society is crucial in paving the way towards positive change. Bitcoin offers a potential solution. Bitcoin operates outside the control of central banks, with a limited supply and a transparent nature that encourages responsible financial behavior and personal empowerment.</p><p>By returning to a form of hard money, individuals can regain control over their financial future. The fixed supply of bitcoin encourages savings and investment, fostering a culture of long-term thinking and responsible financial behavior. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin removes the dependence on centralized authorities and reduces the risk of inflationary practices, providing stability and transparency. </p><p>Embracing Bitcoin and decentralized financial systems can provide individuals with the means to break free from the cycle of high time preference, poor health and financial dependence. Bitcoin empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their finances, allocate resources efficiently and invest in their personal well-beings and futures. </p><p>The link between fiat currency and the emergence of fiat society cannot be overlooked. As an emergency medicine physician, witnessing the consequences firsthand, it is clear that a shift towards alternative monetary systems like Bitcoin, combined with financial education and personal responsibility, can pave the way for a healthier, more financially-stable society. </p><p>Bitcoin offers a path to personal empowerment and financial stability by breaking free from the grip of fiat currency. By regaining control over their lives and finances, individuals can improve their well-beings, escape the cycle of poverty and create a more prosperous future. However, it is important to approach this transition with thoughtful consideration, education and accessibility to ensure inclusivity. Through embracing  Bitcoin, we can strive toward a society where people are not mere products of fiat currency but rather creators of their own destiny.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Travis Headley.

When crypto exchanges, stablecoins and banks are collapsing left and right, it looks suspiciously like we are already in the “suddenly” portion. And it is suddenly that currencies of the past have moved from the pocketbooks to the history books. </p><p>Hyperinflation is a general increase in prices by 50% or more in a single month. <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Hyperinflation-A-World-History/Liping/p/book/9780367529208">Alternatively</a>, sometimes economists and journalists use a lower rate of monthly inflation sustained over a year (but that still amounts to 100%, 500% or 1,000%). The imprecision leads to some confusion in what does or does not constitute a hyperinflation.</p><p>Definitional quibbles aside, the main point is to illustrate the ultimate death of a fiat currency. Hyperinflation of whichever caliber is a situation where money holders rush for the exits, like depositors in a bank run rush for their funds. Literally <em>anything</em> is better to hold on to than the melting ice cube that is a hyperinflating currency. </p><p>A hyperinflating currency is often accompanied by collapsing economies, lawlessness and widespread poverty; and is usually preceded by extremely large money printing in service of covering equally vast government deficits. Double- or triple-digit increases in general prices cannot happen without a massive expansion of the money supply; and that generally doesn’t take place unless a country’s fiscal authority has difficulty financing itself and leans on the monetary authority to run the printing presses.</p><h2>BACKGROUND: What Hyperinflation is and how it happens</h2><p>In 1956, the economist <a href="https://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2011/01/Cagan1.pdf">Phillip Cagan</a> wanted to study extreme cases of monetary dysfunction. As we’ve learned over the past few years, whenever prices go berserk there is a big kerfuffle about who’s to blame — greedy capitalists, vague supply chain bottlenecks, unprecedented money printing by the Fed and fiscal deficits by the Treasury or that evil-looking dictator halfway around the world.</p><p>Cagan wanted to abstract away from any changes in “real” incomes and prices, and therefore placed his threshold at 50% price rises <em>in a single month</em>; any offsetting or competing changes in real factors, said Cagan, can then be safely disregarded. The threshold stuck, even though 50% a month makes for <em>astronomically </em>high rates of inflation (equal to about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#:~:text=Economists%20usually%20follow%20Cagan's%20description,yearly%20rate%20of%2012974.63%25">13,000%</a> annually). The good news is that such an extreme collapse and mismanagement of fiat money is rare — so rare, in fact, that the Hanke-Krus World Hyperinflation Table, often considered the official list of all documented hyperinflation, contains “only” <a href="https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2017/04/Venezuela_Enters_the_Record_Book.pdf">57 entries</a>. (Updated for the last few years, its authors <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1452017414250500096">now claim</a> 62.) </p><p>The bad news is that inflation rates well below that very demanding threshold have destroyed many more societies and wreaked just as much havoc in their economic lives. Inflation “bites” at much, much lower rates than that required for going into “hyper.”</p><p>Nobody does inflation like us moderns. Even the most disastrous monetary collapses in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4981448_Modern_Hyper-_and_High_Inflations">centuries past</a> have been rather mild compared to the inflations and hyperinflations of the fiat age.</p><h2>What Hyperinflation Looks like</h2><p>“Hyperinflation very rarely occurs all of a sudden, without any early warning signs,” writes He Liping in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperinflation-World-History-China-Perspectives/dp/1138560081"><em>Hyperinflation: A World History</em></a>. Rather, they stem from earlier episodes of high inflation that escalate into the hyper variety. </p><p>But it’s not particularly predictive, since most episodes of <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/022/0040/002/article-A007-en.xml">high inflation</a> do <em>not </em>descend into hyperinflation. So what causes general periods of high inflation in the tens or twenties of percent that most Western countries experienced in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic in 2021-22 is different from what causes some of those episodes to devolve into hyperinflation.</p><p>The list of culprits for <em>high </em>inflation regimes include</p><ul><li>Extreme supply shocks that cause prices of key commodities to rise rapidly for a sustained time.</li><li>Expansionary monetary policy that a) involves central bank printing a lot of new money, and/or b) commercial banks lending freely, without restraint. </li><li>Fiscal authorities run fiscal deficits and ensure that aggregate demand runs hot (above trend or above the economy’s capacity).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;For high inflations to turn into <em>hyperinflations</em>, more extreme events must take place. Usually, the nation-state itself is at risk such as during or after wars, a dominant national industry collapses or the public loses trust in the government entirely. More extreme versions of the above are usually involve</p><ul><li>A fiscal authority running extremely large deficits in response to nation-wide or dependent industry shocks (pandemics, war, systemic bank failures). </li><li>The debt is monetized by the central bank and forced upon the population, often through the use of laws that mandate payments in the nation’s currency or bans the use of foreign currencies. </li><li>Complete institutional decay; efforts to stabilize the money supply or the fiscal deficits fail. </li></ul><p>In a hyperinflation event, holding cash or cash balances becomes the most irrational of economic actions, yet the one thing a government needs its citizens to do. </p><p>There is only so much printing you can — or would — do if there weren’t underlying problems or fiscal authorities breathing down your neck; there are only so much additional money the public wishes to hold, and when you start up the presses, the seigniorage profit you can extract becomes smaller and smaller when they ditch your currency for literally anything else. (“People are exchanging their dollars for <a href="https://youtu.be/cbI31x3FpS0?t=122"><em>dog money</em></a>.”)</p><p>Everybody wants to transact, often trying to get their wages paid several times a day and head to the store to purchase <em>anything</em>. Everybody wants to borrow or consume on credit — since one’s debt will disappear in real terms — yet nobody wants to lend: banks usually <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-banks-idUSKBN1HV1GO">curtail lending</a>, and credit runs dry. Prior debts are completely wiped out, as they were fixed in nominal terms. A hyperinflation event closely resembles a “clean slate,” a way for collapsed nation-states to restart, monetarily speaking. They reshuffle the net ownership of hard assets like property, machinery, precious metals or foreign currency. Nothing of financial consequence remains: all credit ties are inflated into nothingness. Financial ties no longer exist. It’s the ultimate weapon of mass financial destruction.</p><h2>History of hyperinflations</h2><p>Though the first cited instance is usually revolutionary France, the modern times contain four clusters of hyperinflations. First, the 1920s when the losers of WWI printed away their debts and wartime reparations. This is where we get the wheelbarrow imagery and which Adam Fergusson’s classic <em>When Money Dies</em> so expertly chronicles.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Second, after the end of World War II, we have another bout of war-related regime collapses leading rulers to print away their unsustainable obligations — Greece, Philippines, Hungary, China, and Taiwan. </p><p>Third, around the year 1990 when the Soviet sphere of influence imploded, the Russian ruble as well as several Central Asian and Eastern European countries saw their defunct currencies inflate away into nothingness. Soviet-connected Angola followed suit, and, in the years before Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Peru again. </p><p>Fourth, the more recent economic basket cases of <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/why-dollarization-doesnt-work-in-zimbabwe/">Zimbabwe</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tragedy-of-venezuela-1527177202">Venezuela</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/07/life-in-lebanon-under-hyperinflation/">Lebanon</a>. They all present stories of obscene mismanagement and state failure that while not exactly mirroring the previous clusters of hyperinflations, at least share their core features. </p><p>Egypt, Turkey and Sri Lanka are other nations whose currency debasements in 2022 were so stunningly bad as to merit a dishonorable mention. Though disastrous for these countries’ economies and tragic for the holders of their currencies — with head-spinning high inflation rates of 80% (<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/21/lessons-from-turkey-on-the-evils-of-high-inflation">Turkey</a>), 50%-ish (<a href="about:blank">Sri Lanka</a>) or over 100% (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/154bcd8c-a2ee-461f-83e4-dce1c8269171">Argentina</a>) — it is scant relief that their runaway monetary systems are long ways off to formally qualify as hyperinflations. You get terrible outcomes way before runaway inflation crosses the “hyper” threshold.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>High inflation episodes (double digits or more) are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188905001946">not stable</a>. The printing by authorities and monetary flight by users either accelerate or slow down; there is no such thing as a “stable” 20% inflation year after year. </p><p>What’s clear from the historical record is that <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/002205102760273805">hyperinflations</a> “are a modern phenomenon related to the need to print paper money to finance large fiscal deficits caused by wars, revolutions, the end of empires, and the establishment of new states.”</p><h3>They end in two ways: </h3><ol><li>Money becomes so worthless and dysfunctional that all its users have moved to another currency. Even viable governments that keep forcing their hyperinflating currencies onto the citizenry through legal tender and public receivability laws, receive only minor benefits from printing. Currency holders have left for harder monies or foreign cash; there is precious little seigniorage left to extract. Example: Zimbabwe 2007-2008, or Venezuela 2017-18. </li><li>Hyperinflation ends by fiscal and monetary reform of some sort. A new currency, often new rulers or constitution, as well as support from international organizations. In some cases, rulers seeing the writing on the wall purposefully hyperinflate their collapsing currency while preparing to jump to a new, stable one. Example: Brazil in the 1990s or Hungary in the 1940s. </li></ol><p>While currency collapses are a most painful reminder of monetary excesses, their ultimate causes are almost always <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/02/11/the-roots-of-hyperinflation">fiscal problems and political disarray</a> — a chronic weakness, a flailing dominant industry, a runaway fiscal spending regime. </p><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">three basic functions of money</a> — <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> — are impacted differently by instances of very high inflation or hyperinflation. Store of value is the <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Hyperinflation-A-World-History/Liping/p/book/9780367529208">first to go</a>, as evidenced by pictures of wheelbarrow inflation; the money becomes too unusable a vehicle through which to move value across time. The unit of account role seems remarkably resilient in that money users can <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2008/10/15/day-life-hyperinflation">change price tags</a> and adjust mental models to the ever-shifting nominal prices. Accounts from Zimbabwe, Lebanon or South America indicate that money users can keep “thinking” in a currency unit (keep performing economic calculation) even though the rapid changes in daily value makes it harder to do this well.</p><p>Both hyperinflation and high inflation are severe headwinds on economic output and a wasteful use of human efforts, but money’s “<a href="https://bitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-monetary-metric/">metric role</a>” doesn't immediately go away. The medium of exchange role, which economists have long held to be the <a href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/spring/summer-2019/money-debt-trust-central-banking">foundational monetary role</a> from which the other functions stem, seems to be the most resilient. You can transact, hot potato-style, even with hyperinflating money. </p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">What is Money?</a></p><h2>What happens: The few winners and many losers </h2><p>The natural reaction of Germans and Austrians and Hungarians, wrote Adam Fergusson in his classic account of the hyperinflations in the 1920s <a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/adam-fergusson/when-money-dies/9781586489953/"><em>When Money Dies</em></a>, was “to assume not so much that their money was falling in value as that the goods which it bought were becoming more expensive in absolute terms.” When prices rose, “people demanded not a stable purchasing power for the marks they had, but more marks to buy what they needed.” </p><p>Hundred years later — a different time in different lands with a different money — the same doubts go through people’s minds. Inflation, of its hyper-variety or the ones we’re living through in the 2020s, muddies people’s ability to make economic decisions. It gets harder to know how much something “costs,” if a business is making a real profit or if a household is adding to or depleting its savings.</p><p><em>The Economist’s</em> account of the effects of Turkey’s inflation last year summarized the economy-wide consequences of inflation running amok. Under high (or hyper-)inflation, time horizons shrink and decision-making collapses to day-to-day cash management. Like all inflations there are arbitrary redistributions of wealth: </p><ol><li>The economic cost of high inflation is the unpredictability of the price system, the volatility of prices themselves. If you think bitcoin’s exchange rate to the USD is “volatile,” you haven’t seen basic prices in hyperinflating countries — wages, assets, grocery stores, rents. It undermines consumers’ ability to plan or make economic choices. Production gets delayed, investment decisions postponed and the economy squeezed since spending decisions are brought forward to the present. </li><li>In a similar vein, price signals don’t work as well anymore. It’s harder to see through the nominal prices to the real economic factors of supply and demand — like the car window into the economy suddenly becoming foggy. Haggling over exact prices makes transaction costs shoot up, which benefit nobody; partially substituting the failing money for foreign currency adds a second layer of (often black-market) exchange rates to juggle. </li><li>It’s unfair. Those best placed to play the inflation game, to shelter their wealth through property, hard assets or foreign currencies, can protect themselves. It causes a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-two-realities-people-with-dollars-and-those-without-11553511600">rift</a> between those who can access foreign currency or hard assets, and those who cannot. </li></ol><p>While most people’s economic lives are disrupted by (hyper)inflation and in aggregate everyone loses, some people benefit along the way. </p><ul><li>The most obvious losers are those holding cash or cash balances, since these are straight away worth less. </li><li>The most direct beneficiaries are debtors, whose debt gets inflated away; insofar as they can have their incomes keep pace with the fast rises in prices, the real <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/who-bears-the-burden-of-dollars-falling-purchasing-power/">financial burden</a> of the debt disappears. The flipside of that is the creditor, who loses purchasing power when their fixed-value asset deflates into nothingness.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Do governments benefit from high or hyperinflation?</h3><p>There is a lot of nuance to whether governments benefit from high inflation. The government itself usually benefits, since seigniorage accrues to the issuer of the currency. But general tax collection doesn’t happen instantly and so taxes on past incomes may be paid later in less valuable, inflated money. Besides, a poorer real economy usually makes for less economic resources that a government can tax. </p><p>Another way governments benefit is that their expenses are usually capped in nominal terms while tax receipts rise in proportion to prices and incomes. </p><p>As a large debtor, a government all else equal, has an easier time nominally servicing its debt — indeed, large government debts and financial obligations are major reasons to hyperinflate the currency in the first place. On the other hand, international creditors quickly catch on and refuse to lend to a hyperinflating government, or demand that they borrow in foreign currency and at additional interest rates. </p><p>Some institutional features matter too. To take two recent examples from the U.S.: Social Security indexation and the loss of income from the Fed. While the debt that gets inflated away involves a government’s pension obligation to retirees, there may be indexed compensation when prices rise. In December 2022, Social Security payments were adjusted upwards by <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/latestCOLA.html">8.7%</a> to account for the inflation captured in CPI over the last year. In more extreme cases of inflation or hyperinflation, such compensation might be delayed, or less stable governmental institutions may lack such features altogether, which would result in cuts in financial welfare for the elderly.</p><p>Similarly, when the Fed hiked rates aggressively during 2022, it exposed itself to accounting losses. For the foreseeable future it has therefore suspended its <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/broke-federal-reserve/">$100 billion in annual remittances</a> to the Treasury. While a drop in the 6 trillion <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58946">federal outlay</a> bucket, it nevertheless shows how prior money printing can cause a loss of fiscal income in the future.</p><p>When a monetary authority has lost enough credibility (the money users give up a rapidly deteriorating money for precisely anything) it doesn’t much matter how one moves the small levers left under the monetary authority’s control. Hyperinflation, therefore, can be seen as a high inflation where the monetary authorities have lost control.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bottom line:</h2><p>Hyperinflations happen when the nation-state backers of a currency go out of business — as in the Balkan states and former Soviet Bloc countries in the early 1990s. They also happen from extreme mismanagement, from the Weimar Republic in the 1920s to the South American episodes in the 1980s and 1990s, or Venezuela and Zimbabwe more recently. </p><p>Remember that the German hyperinflation took place between 1922 and 1923, after wartime inflation (1914-1918) and postwar reparations debacle had gradually degraded the country’s finances and industrial capacity. Much like today’s monetary struggles, there was plenty of blame to go around but the point remains: it takes a long time for a thriving and monetary stable empire to devolve into the jaws of hyperinflationary chaos. </p><p>Every currency regime ends, gradually then suddenly. Perhaps things move faster today, but spotting a USD hyperinflation on the horizon (like <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636822077775941633">Balaji did</a> in March 2023) might be too early yet. While we might not have reached the “suddenly” part yet, we can’t be sure that the “gradually” hasn’t already begun.</p><p>America in 2023 features many of the ingredients often involved in hyperinflations: domestic turmoil, runaway fiscal deficits, a central bank unable to imbue credibility or manage its price stabilization goals, grave doubts about the banks’ solvency. </p><p>The history of hyperinflation is vast but mostly confined to the modern age of fiat. If it’s any guide for the future, a descent into hyperinflation happens much more slowly and takes a lot longer than a few months.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4NjYyNTY5MDA5OTQ4NDIz/what-is-hyperinflation-feature-image-no-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NjYyNTIwNDIzMDY1MzUx/what-is-hyperinflation-graph.png" height="542" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4NjYyNTI4MjA3NjkzNTc1/hanke-krus-hyperinflation.png" height="312" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey’s #startsmall Pledges $5 Million Over 5 Years To Bitcoin Nonprofit Brink]]></title><description><![CDATA[The funding will provide a steady foundation for Brink to continue its mission of supporting Bitcoin development.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/startsmall-pledges-5-million-over-5-years-to-bitcoin-nonprofit-brink</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/startsmall-pledges-5-million-over-5-years-to-bitcoin-nonprofit-brink</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin development]]></category><category><![CDATA[brink]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Donations]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU3NjUwNDM3/bitcoin-tree.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin development nonprofit, Brink, has received a significant financial boost with a pledge of $5 million from Jack Dorsey's #startsmall organization.

This move comes as cross-border payments from the U.S. to Mexico reach historic highs, with Mexico receiving a record <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT?locations=MX">$60 billion</a> in remittances from the U.S. alone in 2022.</p><p>By leveraging Bitcoin's Lightning Network, Strike aims to provide a faster, cheaper and more accessible alternative to traditional money transfer providers in Mexico. With Send Globally, users will be able to enjoy instant payments to a Mexican bank account without added transaction fees. In a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, Jack Mallers, founder and CEO of Strike, stated, "We're excited to bring fast, low-cost cross-border payments via the Lightning Network to Mexico, enabling more people to send money home."</p><p>To facilitate these transfers, dollars are converted into bitcoin, which is sent via the Lightning Network to a third-party partner. The partner then converts the bitcoin into local currency and sends it directly to the recipient's bank account. Strike has partnered with Relampago in Mexico to enable transfers from U.S. dollars that are received as local currency in a recipient's bank account.</p><p>Immanuel Joy, CEO of Relampago, expressed pride in the partnership, stating, "By harnessing the Lightning Network, we enable instant, low-cost, cross-border payments and are transforming the financial landscape for millions of Latin American individuals."</p><p>Since its launch in December 2022, Strike has expanded Send Globally to over a dozen countries, including the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-launches-remittances-to-philippines">Philippines</a>, Vietnam, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/strike-launches-instant-african-remittances">Nigeria</a>, and now Mexico. These countries are among the top 10 largest cross-border markets in the world.</p><p>Strike's expansion of Send Globally to Mexico demonstrates its commitment to providing accessible and efficient cross-border payment solutions. With the rising importance of remittances and the demand for faster and cheaper transfers, Strike's innovative approach has the potential to positively impact millions of people in Mexico and other countries around the world.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODA5NDM0MDkzMjA3/mexicos-proposed-crypto-laws-create-new-barriers-for-exchanges.jpg"/></item></channel></rss>
