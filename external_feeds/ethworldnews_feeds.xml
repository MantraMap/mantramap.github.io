<ul><li>MakerDAO has purchased U.S. Treasury bonds worth a whopping $700 million.&nbsp;</li><li>The DeFi protocol’s total Treasuries holdings now stand at $1.2 billion amid attempts to diversify its holdings.&nbsp;</li><li>Maker’s first U.S. Treasuries purchase was with $500 million back in October 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest purchase marks the last step in the protocol’s Endgame Plan which was unveiled by its founder Rune Christensen.</li></ul>



<p>MakerDAO has invested a whopping $700 million to acquire United States Treasury bonds in a bid to diversify its holdings. The decentralized finance protocol’s latest purchase is part of a broader plan to diversify the assets backing its $4.5 billion dollar-pegged DAI stablecoin by including more traditional financial assets such as government bonds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>MakerDAO Brings Total US Treasuries Holdings To $1.2 Billion</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/crypto-project-buys-700-million-of-t-bills-to-diversify-assets" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, MakerDAO’s bid to diversify its holdings has brought its total U.S. Treasuries holdings to a whopping $1.2 billion. This figure marks a significant increase since the DeFi lending protocol&#8217;s first government bond purchase of $500 million back in October 2022. The investment in these assets is the protocol’s way of increasing exposure to low risk, liquid traditional assets. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Through the diversification of its collateral pool with this U.S. Treasury ladder strategy, Maker is taking advantage of the current yield environment and putting its assets to work. Given the success of the initial deployment and today’s robust bond market, this increase in Maker’s real-world asset exposure is a strong, reliable, and flexible solution that will generate more revenue for the protocol.” </p><cite>Monetalis CEO Allan Pedersen</cite></blockquote>



<p>The plan to acquire the latest batch of U.S. Treasuries was finalized earlier this month after the community behind Maker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/makerdao-buy-1-28-billion-us-treasuries/">approved</a> a proposal to increase the upper limit of a real-world asset (RWA) vault. The $1.25 billion vault is managed by digital asset manager Monetalis Clydesdale. The Monetalis Group reportedly completed the purchase of the U.S. Treasuries on behalf of MakerDAO.  This purchase marks the final step of the Endgame Plan which was unveiled by Maker&#8217;s founder Rune Christensen.</p>

<ul><li>The Monetary Authority of Singapore has published a whitepaper in collaboration with other central banks and financial institutions.&nbsp;</li><li>The central bank proposed standards for the use of digital money, including Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC).&nbsp;</li><li>The MAS tapped the International Monetary Fund as well as Amazon and DBS for its proposal.</li></ul>



<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has released a white paper in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/canada-central-bank-public-feedback-cbdc/">central banks</a> of Italy and South Korea, as well as multiple industry giants. The Singaporean Central Bank proposed a common protocol for specifying conditions for the use of digital money, including central bank digital currencies (CBDC), tokenized bank deposits, and stablecoins on a distributed ledger. </p>



<h2><strong>MAS Taps Amazon and DBS To Collaborate on CBDC &amp; Stablecoin Rules</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-proposes-standards-for-digital-money" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the whitepaper was supported by the release of software prototypes that demonstrate the concept of Purpose Bound Money (PBM). PBM enables senders to specify conditions, such as validity period and types of shops when making transfers in CBDCs and stablecoins. The MAS was assisted by Banca d’Italia, Bank of Korea as well as fintech and financial institutions. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“This collaboration among industry players and policymakers has helped achieve important advances in settlement efficiency, merchant acquisition, and user experience with the use of digital money. More importantly, it has enhanced the prospects for digital money becoming a key component of the future financial and payments landscape.&#8221;</p><cite>Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer, Monetary Authority of Singapore</cite></blockquote>



<p>The central banks tapped industry leaders, including Amazon, Grab, and Fazz for a use case involving escrow arrangements for online retail payments. This would allow payment to be released to the merchant only when the customer receives the items purchased, thus providing greater assurance to both parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, DBS, NETS, and UOB will help with trials, including PBM-based cashback and other incentives to improve consumer experiences while reducing frictions faced by merchants, such as manual reconciliation of sales proceeds and time needed to onboard new sales campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>OPNX Enters Partnership With 3AC Ventures</h2>



<p>The official announcement says the partnership between OPNX and 3AC ventures will pave a clearer path toward decentralization by backing select projects.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The partnership will invest in projects building in the OPNX ecosystem and working towards a decentralized future.</p></blockquote>



<p>3AC Ventures seems to be a fork of the fallen 3AC entity but with no “leverage, no debt, no fear” this time, Davies replied to a user on Twitter. The firm boasts a business model built around “superior risk-adjusted” returns without the use of leverage, per details from the 3AC Ventures website.</p>

<p>The announcement and support from 3AC’s Davies met with mixed reactions on social media as some users were left baffled by the move. “Here we go again,” one user said while another replied, “Anyone who invests with you at this point deserves what they get&#8221;. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Bitcoin neared double-digit gain in the past 24 hours following ETF applications from giant TradFi players like BlackRock.</li><li>BTC traded above $28,800 on Monday, over 7% up in the past 1 day per data from TradingView and CMC.</li><li>$8 trillion asset manager BlackRock filed a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC galvanizing other applications amid an ongoing crypto crackdown in the U.S.</li></ul>



<p>Bitcoin, crypto’s largest token by market cap, edged toward $29,000 during trading hours on June 21 on the back of growing interest from major institutional players in traditional finance.</p>



<p>According to data from CoinMarketCap, BTC was almost in double-digit gains on Wednesday. The token was up over 7% in the last 24 hours and exchanged hands around $28,900 across crypto trading venues.</p>



<p>BTC’s price also strangely skyrocketed on Binance US, peaking at around $138,000 in the early hours of Wednesday before reclaiming parity with spot market prices in the $28,000 range.</p>



<p>It’s not yet clear what caused the price spike on Binance’s American platform although this is not the first time such an incident has happened in recent times.</p>

<h2>ETF Application Boom After BlackRock Bitcoin Interest</h2>



<p>The prevailing assumption is that Bitcoin is rallying thanks to interest from TradFi institutional players like BlackRock.</p>



<p>Indeed, the $8 trillion asset management behemoth <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-banks-bitcoins-largest-holder-mstr/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-banks-bitcoins-largest-holder-mstr/" rel="noreferrer noopener">applied</a> for a Bitcoin ETF, a product notoriously rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission due to supposed market manipulation concerns.</p>



<p>The company notably has a stellar record with filing ETPs in general with 575 successful filings against 1 failed attempt.</p>



<p>BlackRock also owns a whopping 6% stake in Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC with around 140,000 Bitcoins worth over $3 billion.</p>



<p>The company’s stake in MSTR has seemingly spurred speculations and hopium among proponents that institutional players are taking big bets on BTC, and perhaps the broader crypto market by extension.</p>



<p>At the very least, BlackRock’s move has galvanized other TradFi entities like WisdomTree and Invesco to take a gamble at a Bitcoin ETF filing.</p>



<p>The interest from these players comes at a time when the SEC dropped the hammer on crypto’s two largest centralized exchanges Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>According to the SEC, both platforms <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">violated securities laws</a> by operating unregistered securities exchanges and offering illegal securities tokens. A <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/refute-sec-sol-ada-matic-securities/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/refute-sec-sol-ada-matic-securities/" rel="noreferrer noopener">basket of cryptos</a> like including SOL, ADA, and MATIC were listed in the respective lawsuits.</p>



<p>Trading venues like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-etoro-delist-algo-mana-dash-matic/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-etoro-delist-algo-mana-dash-matic/" rel="noreferrer noopener">eToro</a> and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robinhood</a> subsequently delisted some of these tokens in a bid to mitigate possible regulatory consequences.</p>

<ul><li>Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic unveiled a new Polygon improvement proposal earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The proposal seeks to upgrade Polygon’s proof of stake chain to zkEVM Validium.</li><li>The proposal addresses several concerns, including security, gas spike issues, and reorg issues.&nbsp;</li><li>If approved, the zk compatibility would bring scalability, faster transactions, and greater decentralization to the network.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic has proposed a major upgrade to the network’s proof of stake (PoS) architecture. The proposal seeks to upgrade the PoS chain to a zkEVM Validium. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-supports-franklin-templeton-fund/">Polygon</a>, whose zk rollup went live earlier this year, would still be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine as per the latest proposal. </p>



<h2><strong>MATIC Would Remain Polygon’s Native Staking Token</strong></h2>



<p>According to the pre-Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) <a href="https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187" rel="nofollow noopener">discussion</a> started by Mihailo Bjelic on the network’s governance forum, the proposed upgrade to a zkEVM validium would address the network’s current problems including the security issues, its reliance on Cosmos SDK and Geth, and gas spikes as well as reorg issues. The proposal added that MATIC would continue to serve as Polygon&#8217;s staking token. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today a proposal was published to upgrade Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium, a first-of-its-kind, decentralized ZK Layer 2.<br><br>As a zkEVM validium, Polygon PoS would inherit Ethereum&#39;s unmatched security, while preserving low fees &amp; high scalability.<br><br>👉🏽 <a href="https://t.co/5fsMOqLqRy" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/5fsMOqLqRy</a> <a href="https://t.co/9r9VILxdvu" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/9r9VILxdvu</a></p>&mdash; Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1671208777784209441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">June 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>zkEVM Validium has been presented as a viable, beneficial, and straightforward solution for Polygon’s ongoing issues. Direct benefits of the upgrade would include increased security by leveraging Ethereum&#8217;s high security, and future-proof tech stack rather than legacy blockchain architecture. If approved the proposal would also eliminate reorgs, speed up transaction confirmations, increase stability and fee estimation, and bring greater decentralization while making it compatible with Polygon 2.0. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Upgraded Polygon PoS (zkEVM validium) would offer very high scalability and very low fees, with the tradeoff of storing transaction data locally instead of on Ethereum. It would be a great fit for applications that have high transaction volume and require low transaction fees, e.g. Web3 gaming and social.” </p><cite>Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder, Polygon</cite></blockquote>



<p>As per the timeline laid out in accordance with the governance process, the pre-PIP discussion and consensus are expected to be done before the end of July 2023. PIP publishing, discussion, and consensus would take place between October as well as November 2023. That would be followed by PIP implantation and testing between November and January 2024. Lastly, the upgrade and PIP activation on the mainnet would take place between February 2024 and March 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Crypto exchange Gemini has selected Singapore to serve as the hub for its operations in the Asia Pacific region.&nbsp;</li><li>The Winklevoss-owned exchange plans to hire more than 100 employees for its Singapore office.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange is also growing its engineering base in India and plans to hire key employees for the Gurgaon office.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Gemini Trust Company has announced its expansion plans for the Asia Pacific region, with Singapore to serve as its hub for APAC operations. The announcement comes just days after the crypto exchange’s announcement comes just days after its leadership team visited the region as part of their efforts dedicated to global expansion. The crypto exchange has identified APAC as a “great driver” of the next wave of growth for crypto and Gemini.</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini To Expand Engineering Operations In India</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-announces-expansion-plans-in-apac" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Gemini earlier today, the crypto exchange plans to increase its headcount in Singapore by hiring more than 100 employees over the next 12 months. The exchange’s history with the country dates back to 2020 when it launched support for the Singapore Dollar (GSD) in order to provide Singapore residents with seamless access to the crypto market. </p>



<p>In addition to the Singapore hub, Gemini is also expanding its engineering operations in <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-expand-global-engineering-and-operations-teams-with-new-india-office" rel="nofollow noopener">India</a> with an office in the city of Gurgaon which will serve as the second largest engineering hub behind the United States. The Winklevoss-owned exchange is actively hiring software engineers and technical product managers for its Gurgaon office as well. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our engineering, design, and operations teams in India will make significant contributions to the development of our next-generation web and mobile user experiences core platform fundamentals in the area of compliance, data pipelines and warehousing….” </p><cite>Pravjit Tiwana, Gemini’s Global CTO and CEO of Asia Pacific</cite></blockquote>



<p>Gemini’s latest developments in the Asia Pacific region are the result of a broader push for global expansion amid a rising crackdown in the United States. Last month, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-european-headquarters-ireland/">announced</a> Ireland as its hub to manage operations in Europe. </p>

<ul><li>A crypto exchange backed by TradFi giants like Citadel and Fidelity has started operations.&nbsp;</li><li>EDX Markets announced the launch of its digital asset market and the completion of an investment round earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange currently offers several mainstream cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, and LTC.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange will only cater to institutional clients and will use a third party for crypto custody.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>EDX Markets has kicked off operations following an investment round earlier today that added new equity partners. The new investors joined a coalition of founding investors, including traditional finance giants like Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Sequoia Capital. The crypto exchange went live more than nine months after it was unveiled in September last year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>EDX Markets Will Not Serve Retail Customers</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230620110605/en/Digital-Asset-Platform-EDX-Markets-Begins-Trading-and-Completes-New-Funding-Round" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by EDX Markets earlier today, the crypto exchange presented itself as a digital asset marketplace designed to enable safe and compliant trading of digital assets through trusted intermediaries. The exchange also concluded an investment round that added strategic investors, including DV Crypto, GTS, GSR Markets, and Miami International Holdings, which recently acquired <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-ledgerx-acquired-by-m7-holdings/">LedgerX</a> from FTX. </p>



<p>EDX will not cater to retail crypto customers. The new exchange will allow institutional investors to trade top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). While not offering services to retail investors directly, the exchange reportedly expects retail brokerages to send investors’ orders to buy and sell crypto products to its marketplace. The exchange will use a third-party custodian to handle its clients’ digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“EDX’s ability to attract new investors and partners in the face of sector headwinds demonstrates the strength of our platform and the demand for a safe and compliant cryptocurrency market. We are committed to bringing the best of traditional finance to cryptocurrency markets, with an infrastructure built by market experts to embed key institutional best practices.” </p><cite>Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets</cite></blockquote>



<p>EDX also announced that it would launch a new clearinghouse business later this year to make its investors’ settlement princess more efficient. EDX Clearing will settle trades matched on the crypto marketplace and facilitate trades against a central counterparty.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A Montenegro Court sentenced TerraUSD creator Do Kwon to four months in jail for forging travel papers. </li><li>The Terraform Labs founder was set to remain in Montenegrin custody till next year as authorities consider extradition requests from South Korea and the U.S.</li><li>South Korean investigators could seek a 40-year sentence for Do Kwon after his company&#8217;s multi-billion collapse last summer. </li></ul>



<p>Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon was found guilty of forging travel documents and sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro court, <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/D264" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/D264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> said on Monday. Kwon pleaded &#8220;Not  guilty&#8221; last Friday to the charges.</p>



<p>The fugitive Kwon was arrested in March by Montenegrin law enforcement in Podgorica, the country&#8217;s capital city. Authorities detained the former crypto tycoon as he was about to board a private plane bound for Dubai. Kwon was arrested together with Han Chang-Joon, a former CFO and executive at Terra. </p>



<p>Both suspects were initially granted bail before a High Court annulled the decision. Bail was again <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-granted-400k-bail-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-granted-400k-bail-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">granted</a> by the Basic Court prior to today&#8217;s ruling. Furthermore, it was previously determined by a Montenegrin court that Do Kwon would remain in detention for six month while authorities assess extradition requests from South Korea and the U.S. </p>



<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s Legal Woes </h2>



<p>The ruling on June 19 is the first against Do Kwon since his company Terraform Labs collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out billions in investments. Estimates say that the Terra&#8217;s crash, premeditated by the collapse of TerraLUNA (now LUNA Classic or LUNC) and the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), amounted to over $40 billion in drown investments from retail and institutional players. </p>



<p>Indeed, the collapse unleashed a domino effect that saw companies like Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, and BlockFi fall to ruin. </p>



<p>Since then Do Kwon has evaded law enforcement despite claiming to not be on the run. South Korean investigators claim that Do Kwon&#8217;s violations of the country&#8217;s Capital Markets Acts makes the jurisdiction the perfect place for his trial. Kwon could spend as much as 40 years in prison if <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-sentence-40-year-south-korea-jail/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-sentence-40-year-south-korea-jail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">convicted</a> in his home country. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, U.S authorities also want to prosecute Do Kwon as the Securities and Exchange Commission already filed charges against the former Terra CEO. </p>

<ul><li>Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder proposed increasing the validator balance cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.</li><li>The idea being considered within the developer community would stem the growing active validator set size and optimize network efficiency.</li><li>Increasing the limits of validator balances would also make room for auto-compounding of rewards, allowing validators to earn maximum yield for their staked coins.</li></ul>



<p>Following a <a href="https://twitter.com/christine_dkim/status/1669740046256312320?s=46&amp;t=pA66xOVb6aHMw-v_CxFceA" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/christine_dkim/status/1669740046256312320?s=46&amp;t=pA66xOVb6aHMw-v_CxFceA" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposal</a> from Ethereum Foundation researcher Michael Neuder, core developers of crypto’s largest altcoin network could increase the validator balance cap from the 32 ETH limit to a staggering 2,048 ETH if the idea garners support.</p>



<p>Neuder shared the proposal during the developer&#8217;s bi-weekly call where client teams meet to discuss and coordinate the most important updates to the network. The increase in validator balance seems to address a major concern &#8211; the growing number of validators on Ethereum&#8217;s PoS network.</p>



<p>Indeed, the current 32 ETH limit means that entities must run multiple validators if they wish to stake past the limit and access more staking rewards. The balance limit has so far spurred an increase in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">validators which currently exceeds half a million</a>, a rapid increase since The Merge.</p>



<p>According to Neuder’s proposal, increasing the balance limit will push Ethereum toward greater efficiency by optimizing finality in a single block.</p>



<p>While the current balance cap buoys decentralization, it also causes entities to operate a concerning number of validators which could adversely impact network efficiency, Neuder argued during Friday’s developer&#8217;s call.</p>



<h2>More Ethereum Rewards For Validators</h2>



<p>Furthermore, Neuder’s proposal could unlock greater rewards for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum validators</a> since they would be able to stake more and therefore, earn more yield on their staked tokens.</p>



<p>Currently, the 32 ETH limit does not allow validators to earn rewards beyond their capped balances. This limit propels operational costs for larger node operators who end up managing hundreds or thousands of validators in a bid to maximize their yield generation.</p>



<p>If the cap is increased, Neuder argued that an auto-compounding feature could allow for fewer Ethereum validators to exist while accessing greater rewards through auto-compounding of their staked yield.</p>



<p>The researcher warned that the idea is not without risk and developers will continue to weigh the merits alongside other hot-button upgrades mulled in the upcoming Deneb and Cancun.</p>



<p>Deneb which focuses on changes to the consensus layer should roll out based on three EIPs. EIP 7044 introduces a code change that accepts signed validator exits in perpetuity, thus bettering the shaking experience.</p>



<p>Another staking experience upgrade, EIP 4788, aims to improve access to Beacon chain blocks with information on the chain state inside EVMs. EIP 7045 focuses on improved security by expanding the attestation slot from a rolling window of one epoch to two epochs.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Binance is under investigation in France for offering illegal digital asset services and aggravated money laundering, Le Monde reported. </li><li>The platform announced its exit from the Netherlands on Friday after failing to obtain a license and meet up with AML regulations.</li><li>Binance recently shut down its business in Cyprus as part of plans to comply with the newly signed EU MiCA policies.</li><li>The crypto exchange is under heavy scrutiny from the U.S. SEC for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange and offering illegal securities trading to American investors.</li></ul>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Le Monde</a> citing word from the Paris public prosecutors office, Binance is under investigation for illegally providing French investors with digital asset trading facilities and also supporting “acts of aggravated money laundering”. </p>



<p>French authorities allege that the company offered these services to French customers through its local division and regulators have been investigating suspicions since February 2022.  The local publication reported that documents and records seized will be analyzed for evidence as regulators build their case against crypto’s largest centralized exchange. </p>



<p>In other related news, the crypto exchange is <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1669628787267624961?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1669628787267624961?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pulling out of the Dutch market</a> after failing to secure a crypto license and comply with the Netherlands’ anti-money laundering (AML) policies. </p>



<p>Binance’s exit from the Netherlands comes shortly after the company announced plans to shut down its division in Cyprus. This decision was reportedly taken as a strategic move to comply with MiCA, the landmark crypto rule recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-officially-signed-eu-policymakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> into law by EU policymakers.</p>



<h2>Binance Vs SEC</h2>



<p>Friday’s developments about exiting the Dutch markets and investigations in France have emerged amid intense regulatory scrutiny in America. </p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao for breaking securities law, commingling customers&#8217; funds in a private entity, and denying investors of proper protection through necessary disclosure. </p>



<p>Binance US, the company’s American affiliate, has seen its market share shrink to 1% following the news, per Kaiko data. The U.S. trading arm also announced staff cuts as it prepares for a lengthy and expensive litigation process with the SEC. </p>

<p>Coinbase, another major crypto exchange and the largest digital asset trading venue in America was also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> by the SEC for similar rule-breaking. </p>



<p>Both firms have denied the allegations and promised to fight the SEC in court, claiming that the regulator has failed to provide clear rules or offer a path for registration.</p>
