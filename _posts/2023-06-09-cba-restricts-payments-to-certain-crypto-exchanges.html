<p>Australia&rsquo;s Commonwealth Bank introduced new processes to help protect customers from scams associated with making payments to certain crypto exchanges. </p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank in Australia on Thursday introduced new measures to protect customers from possible scam risks associated with making payments to &ldquo;certain&rdquo; crypto exchanges. The bank announced it would decline or hold certain payments to crypto exchanges for 24 hours.</p>
<p>It further said in the coming months, it would introduce AU$10,000 ($6,700) limits in a calendar month, giving the bank time to identify the customer payments to exchanges for crypto purchases.</p>
<p>The bank added that it would closely monitor its new measure&rsquo;s efficacy, saying they are subject to ongoing review.</p>
<p>James Roberts, Commonwealth Bank General Manager of Group Fraud Management Services, said:</p>

<p>Consumer interest in cryptocurrencies has been increasing, and unfortunately scammers globally are capitalising on this trend and masquerading as legitimate investment opportunities or diverting funds into cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>The introduction of 24-hour holds, declines and limits on outbound payments to cryptocurrency exchanges will help reduce both the number of scams and the amount of money lost by customers.</p>

Measures Will Note Eliminate Scam Risk
<p>While the measures will not do away with scam risks, they are designed to reduce customers&rsquo; risk of falling victim to a scam.</p>
<p>Mr Robert further stated:</p>

<p>Customers who make payments to cryptocurrency exchanges are currently facing a significantly higher risk of potentially being scammed.</p>
<p>While these measures will not eliminate the risk of customers suffering losses as a result of a scam that involves a payment to a cryptocurrency exchange, they are part of a range of initiatives designed to help customers reduce their risk of falling victim to a scam.</p>
