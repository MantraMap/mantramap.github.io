										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rapper and musician Tyga has been named in a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/tyga-fights-back-after-being-accused-of-fraud-in-500k-nft-deal-rapper-blames-cryptocurrency-market-crash/ar-AA18G5TX" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lawsuit accusing him</a> of breaching a $500,000 contract to promote a new series of non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>). The rapper is denying all claims of wrongdoing and is trying hard to dismiss all the claims.</p>
<h2>Tyga Named in New NFT-Based Suit</h2>
<p>The plaintiff named in the lawsuit is a UK-based company called Kreation Technologies. The enterprise is suing both Tyga and New Style Media, saying both entities took part in promissory fraud. While the details of the suit are relatively scarce at this time, it is alleged that both Kreation and New Style engaged in a contract acting on behalf of the American musician. The name, likeness, and music of Tyga would be featured in the series’ artwork.</p>
<p>The company says the rapper agreed to take part in four official drops of the NFTs, in which the tokens would be released to a roster of individuals prior to their becoming available for purchase amongst members of the public. Tyga was initially promised $500,000, with about $100K being delivered within the first two days of the drops taking place. Tyga was then required to engage in specific duties prior to the remaining $400K being distributed to his monetary account.</p>
<p>Among the tasks to be completed by the rapper would be posting on social sites like Twitter and Instagram about the new line of tokens. According to Kreation, Tyga failed to do so. He also did not participate in any additional promotion of the tokens, and he also cancelled media interviews in which he was scheduled to discuss the new art line. This, executives claim, contributed to heavy delays in the token drops. Eventually, the project came to a complete halt due to its reported lack of promotion.</p>
<p>Kreation says this caused the firm heavy financial trouble, which is why the company is now filing suit against the rapper. In a statement, Tyga’s representatives defended his actions and said he is not responsible for the company’s shortcomings. The statement reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The agreement turned out to be a bad deal for [Kreation] not because of any actions or non-performance of [Tyga], but because the cryptocurrency market loudly and publicly crashed during the term of the agreement. [Kreation] now seeks a bailout for its failed investment and sued NSMG and [Tyga].</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Terrible Time for Crypto</h2>
<p>Listening to the statement, it’s not difficult to assume there’s some truth to the verbiage given just how badly the digital currency space had it in 2022. In arguably the worst year for crypto on record, the space lost more than $2 trillion in overall valuation, and bitcoin dropped by more than 70 percent.</p>
<p>The case is currently ongoing as Tyga has not yet had the charges against him dismissed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Off Chain Labs, which developed the Arbitrum ecosystem, has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/arbitrum-a-leading-scaling-solution-for-ethereum-will-finally-have-a-native-cryptocurrency/ar-AA18HJGl" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced plans to airdrop</a> $ARB, the new native token of the Arbitrum blockchain which will govern all future operations and protocols. The currency will be given to select individuals to hold and test out until it’s ready to be released to the general investing population.</p>
<h2>Off Chain Labs Is Paving the Way for a New Governance Asset</h2>
<p>Those set to receive early access to the coin will include users of Arbitrum One, the larger of the company’s two blockchains. Customers of Arbitrum Nova, which is designed for web3 games and other social applications, will also get to utilize the token early.</p>
<p>Off Chain Labs has also said it will be establishing what’s called the Arbitrum Foundation and an associated DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). The goal will be to govern the management of the enterprise’s ecosystem, and all holders of the token will be allowed to vote on proposals submitted to the DAO, thus ensuring Arbitrum remains fully decentralized and democratic.</p>
<p>Steven Goldfeder – CEO and co-founder of Off Chain Labs – explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking ahead, we&#8217;re moving closer and closer toward a decentralized financial system, with the Arbitrum technology at the very forefront.</p></blockquote>
<p>He went on to say that the token <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/airdrop/" data-wpel-link="internal">airdrop</a> is designed to ensure the decentralization he and his fellow executives are picturing for Arbitrum reaches full form, and that in no way is it designed to give them additional cash. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t care about the token for the sake of a token. I really don&#8217;t. The token is a tool to decentralize, and a tool to give governance power to users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Arbitrum is a blockchain network that has reached a powerhouse position in just under two years. It is now one of the most popular layer-2 blockchain networks on Ethereum, and it boasts nearly $2 billion in total assets locked within its management core. Its design is to make all Ethereum transactions cheaper and faster.</p>
<p>Up until now, the network – unlike many of the layer-2 blockchains built atop ETH – did not have its own token, which arguably made it appear less legitimate in traders’ eyes. This is now changing, and Goldfeder said it’s all part of a growing trend that has seized the digital currency space in recent years. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s this increasing trend in the community where projects not only want to launch their own application, [but they also actually] want to launch their own chain.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Growing By the Day</h2>
<p>The company also has plans to build what’s going to be called Arbitum Orbit, which will be utilized by developers looking to establish layer-3 blockchains on top of Arbitrum.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Off Chain Labs raised more than $120 million in new funding. It now has a valuation of about $1.2 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grayscale Investments Bitcoin Trust has seen its shares <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/gbtc-jumps-this-week-while-grayscale-ceo-encouraged-after-oral-arguments-in-court-battle-with-sec-over-spot-bitcoin-etf/ar-AA18Favr" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">jump heavily in price</a> over the last few weeks as its court case against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to move more heavily in its favor.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Heats Up Its Fight Against the SEC</h2>
<p>Grayscale is currently at war with the SEC. The latter agency has done all it can over the last six years to penalize crypto companies that don’t move in tandem with its narrative. The goal was initially to regulate and monitor the space for illicit activity, though the SEC appears to have taken on more of a gestapo form in that it’s just prosecuting and penalizing digital currency companies and forcing them to part with tons of money.</p>
<p>One of the most recent SEC/crypto cases involved digital currency trading platform Kraken. In a settlement, the company was forced to part with a $30 million fee and rescind all its staking activities and services.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC has been very much against the introduction of a BTC-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) centered around spot trading, which is at the center of the Grayscale lawsuit. Not long ago, Grayscale sent an application to the SEC for getting such a product started. Naturally, like it’s done with so many other companies, the SEC said “no” in a loud, resounding voice, and things ultimately should have stopped there.</p>
<p>But Grayscale <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/grayscale-sues-sec-over-rejection-of-btc-etf-application/" data-wpel-link="internal">decided to fight back</a>. The company said the SEC had no legitimate reason to turn its application down, and it’s now suing the federal organization in court. At first, the signs of hope appeared faint and distant. No one has ever taken on the SEC without incurring heavy wounds, so many analysts claimed, but things have apparently shifted in Grayscale’s favor, and now it looks like the firm <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/could-grayscale-actually-defeat-the-sec-in-court/" data-wpel-link="internal">may have a chance</a> of winning its case.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Walking out of the courtroom, we were really encouraged.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This Should Give Other Companies Confidence</h2>
<p>The news is filling Grayscale’s halls and operations with positivity. Its bitcoin trust has jumped by more than 20 percent, but aside from that, it’s also giving digital currency companies confidence that they can perhaps take on the SEC and provide traders access with the products they’re aiming to produce.</p>
<p>So many enterprises – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-issues-another-no-to-van-ecks-bitcoin-etf/" data-wpel-link="internal">such as Van Eck</a> – have struggled to get their fair shake from the SEC when they submit BTC-based ETF applications, which have been flooding the SEC’s offices since 2017 give or take. Each time, the agency has given these companies the cold shoulder and dismissed them, but now with Grayscale playing the largest and most powerful hand yet, it looks like things may turn around not just for its executives, but for all those looking to develop their own crypto ETF products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Silicon Valley Bank is in the process of filing bankruptcy, bringing back rough <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">memories of the FTX</a> debacle five months ago. However, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/17/buy-now-2-trillion-fed-bazooka-triggers-shock-hyperinflation-warning-amid-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-boom/?sh=3c995c24651d" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">effects appear to be the</a> opposite of what they were back in November. During that time, bitcoin and its altcoin cousins fell to new lows, whereas this time around, bitcoin and several of its counterparts appear to be surging like crazy.</p>
<h2>Silicon Valley Dips While BTC Rises</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, BTC – the world’s number one cryptocurrency by market cap – has shot beyond the $27,000 mark, and there are many analysts out there that seem to believe $30K could be next granted the currency manages to keep up its present patterns. Just over the last few weeks, the currency has risen by more than 30 percent, and many other assets are following in its footsteps.</p>
<p>With bitcoin rising, many crypto-based stocks – such as Coinbase – are also on the rise. America’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange has seen its stock jump by more than nine percent during this time, and the momentum just keeps on picking up as time goes by.</p>
<p>Coinbase’s chief tech officer Balaji Srinivasan says that the current banking crisis being witnessed in the States could lead to a serious case of hyperinflation. He is now telling users to buy as much BTC and crypto as they can before the standard banking industry goes haywire. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The central bank, the banks, and the bank regulators have bankrupted all of us. They hid their insolvency from you, the depositors, and they&#8217;re about to print $2 trillion to hyperinflate the dollar. In the digital age, this will happen very quickly, so buy bitcoin now and get your coins off exchanges.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fall of Silicon Valley Bank is being labeled the biggest collapse since the 2008 financial crisis. The Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) has now had to step in and say that all deposits lost at both Silicon Valley and Signature Bank will be fully backed. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou explained in a recent note to his clients:</p>
<blockquote><p>The usage of the Fed’s bank term funding program is likely to be big.</p></blockquote>
<p>Srinivasan continued his initial statement with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The entire banking system is lying to you about solvency. They are trying to ensure you don&#8217;t exit to bitcoin before they print the money.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Is the Banking System Lying to Us?</h2>
<p>Markus Thielen – head of research and strategy at Matrix Port – also threw his two cents into the mix, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin benefits from full-blown, government-guaranteed deposit insurance, from inflation falling back to the three percent level, which allows the central bank to become less hawkish, and from regulatory overhang that has impacted stablecoins such as BUSD and, recently, USDC. Bitcoin loves liquidity, and is the primary crypto weapon of choice when those liquidity floodgates are being alternated, such as now.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/personalfinance/attorney-general-aaron-ford-warns-nevadans-of-recent-cryptocurrency-scams/ar-AA18IX5A" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">has sworn to protect</a> all residents of his state from crypto scams, and he’s putting out notices to everyone to tell them what they can do to avoid becoming victims.</p>
<h2>Aaron Ford Vows to Protect People of His State</h2>
<p>In a recent statement, Ford commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The safety of Nevada consumers is a top priority at my office. As technology becomes an increasingly integral part of our lives, scams involving digital currency are becoming more prevalent. We want Nevadans to know how cryptocurrency works and what they should watch out for to protect themselves and their families.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crypto scams have been rather prominent as of late. Today, they are mostly taking on the form of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a>, in which hackers and cyberthieves find would-be victims by traveling through dating sites and related platforms to find people looking for love or lasting partners. They narrow in on certain individuals and get to know them personally.</p>
<p>All seems fine and dandy at first and a victim seems to think they’ve found a soul mate of sorts. It’s not long before they’re coaxed into investing in a phony crypto platform, though they’re not aware that it’s fake. All seems legitimate and real, and they don’t want to disappoint the new friend they’ve made, so they put money into the platform, not knowing that everything is run by their new partner’s alleged ring of fellow cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Everything initially goes well in that their investments appear to be growing. They’re convinced to invest more, and before long, they’ve made more money than they ever thought possible. However, when they go to make a withdrawal, problems usually arise. They are told that they cannot do so unless they pay heavy fees or invest even more funds into the platform.</p>
<p>Eventually, they realize what happened and walk away with bruised egos, broken hearts, and empty pockets. It’s a rough situation to be in, no doubt. Ford also says that with so many more businesses in his state (and elsewhere) now becoming more crypto friendly, there are many hackers out there that have become savvy to how these companies operate and have adapted to their thievery methods so they can make off with customer funds, not just money from those looking for love.</p>
<h2>How to Avoid Being a Victim</h2>
<p>Ford is telling people what they can do to avoid falling for crypto scams. For one thing, they should never share their financial data with anyone they meet on a dating site. They can also perform due diligence regarding certain platforms to see if they’re real or not. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>Lastly, they can surround themselves with plenty of friends and family that they can turn to for advice if they’re ever unsure about what will happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eric Adams has long been a crypto fan. As the mayor of New York City, arguably one of the biggest cities in the world, Adams goes against what many of his democrat constituents in the region say and do regarding crypto. For them, the asset is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-signs-crypto-moratorium-into-law/" data-wpel-link="internal">something to be banned</a> and ignored, while Adams has gone so far as to claim BTC should be <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eric-adams-wants-crypto-taught-in-nyc-schools/" data-wpel-link="internal">taught in public schoolrooms</a>.</p>
<h2>Eric Adams and Blockchain: What Are the Possibilities?</h2>
<p>The enthusiasm of Adams appears to be <a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/11883-city-council-mayor-adams-blockchain-cryptocurrency" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">landing on the people</a> that now work with him and for him. Not long ago, Jennifer Gutierrez – a city council member – called for an oversight hearing into blockchain technology and how Adams wants to use it in future NYC operations. In her opening statements on the panel, she commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We must do our due diligence to not only understand cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, but also make sure New Yorkers can properly access the necessary information to safely navigate these novel technologies. Today’s hearing aims to draw in any vision for both technologies, ensuring that as a city, we are giving thoughtful consideration to this potentially transformational technology and industry, rather than refusing to exchange because the issues are complicated and not yet fully formed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The city’s chief technology officer Matthew Fraser is also becoming a blockchain fan, saying it could be a powerful tool in driving New York City forward. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the blockchain industry helping New York City’s economy recover from the lingering effects of the pandemic, blockchain technology has the potential to streamline and centralize document retention, enable real-time record consolidation, and support asset transfers, among many other applications. New York City has proudly been a pioneer in embracing the blockchain industry, as it evaluates the potential government applications and plants a flag as a viable home for blockchain companies that can grow our economy and hire new workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Adams administration has now been without controversy. One of the blockchain uses his team has proposed is using it to track what kind of food users are buying and then gather the information to educate them about healthier behavior. While the intent may be noble, this can be considered a clear invasion of privacy. Fraser commented on this by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine for food benefits, if you had a digital wallet where you went out and spent a dollar on vegetables or something healthy versus sugary snacks or soda. The city could provide incentive points, meaning, dollar-matching, dollar-for-dollar, for what you spend on healthy products.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Spy on People!</h2>
<p>Queens republican and city council member Vickie Paladino also threw her two cents in, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t like the idea that you’re going to monitor people’s spending habits, whether they choose to buy healthy food or a bag of potato chips.</p></blockquote>

<li>The price is now trading below the $130 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $131 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a decent increase if it stays above the $120 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining from the $135 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-more-gains-above-31k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could decline heavily if there is a move below $120.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $135 and $136 resistance levels. BCH formed a high near $136.18 and started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $130.00 and $125.00 support levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $131 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair even declined below the $125 support.</p>
<p>A low is formed near $121.37 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading below the $128 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-bulls-aim-higher-150-possible-target/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance is near the $125 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $136.18 swing high to the $121.37 low.</p>
<p>The next key resistance is near $128. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $136.18 swing high to the $121.37 low.</p>
<p>The main resistance sits near the $130 level. Any more gains above $128 and $130 could set the pace for a move toward the $135 level. If there is a move above the $135 resistance, the price could rise toward the $142 zone.</p>
<p>If not, the price might continue lower below $121. Immediate support on the downside is near the $120 zone. The next major support is near the $115 level, below which the bears might aim for $105.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chip Mixer – a notorious crypto tool designed to hide where digital currencies have been garnered or who they’re being used by – has <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-down-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixing-182047437.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">been shut down by authorities</a> with the Department of Justice (DOJ). At the time of writing, it is believed the tool allowed cyberthieves and assorted criminals to launder as much as $3 billion in illicit digital funds.</p>
<h2>Chip Mixer Is No More</h2>
<p>The DOJ also put out a statement claiming to have shuttered two sites associated with Chip Mixer along with the primary product itself. Chip Mixer may have been involved in several hacking schemes, as well as crypto heists, fraud, and even ransomware. The statement read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>This morning, working with partners at home and abroad, the Department of Justice disabled a prolific cryptocurrency mixer, which has fueled ransomware attacks, state-sponsored crypto-heists, and darknet purchases across the globe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mixers can be very dangerous in that they are built to hide digital assets from prying eyes and law enforcement agencies. Thus, should crypto thieves or other illicit actors seek out their services, they can enclose where they receive their money, where they’re sending it, and who they got it from. This is troublesome because if the money is stolen (and most of the time, it is) it can be hard to trace, and thus victims stand to lose out 90 percent of the time.</p>
<p>In addition to shutting down the mixer, a Vietnamese operator of the tool has been arrested and charged with money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and identity theft among other things. A separate complaint reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chip Mixer attracted a significant criminal clientele and became indispensable in obfuscating and laundering funds from multiple criminal schemes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jacqueline Maguire of the FBI Philadelphia Field Office also threw her two cents in, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Criminals have long sought to launder the proceeds of their illegal activity through various means. Technology has changed the game, though, with a site like Chip Mixer and facilitator[s] like Nguyen enabling bad actors to do so on a grand scale with ease.</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn’t the first time the U.S. has targeted a foreign mixer. Not too long ago, the country issued <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/north-korea-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash-sanctioned-by-u-s/" data-wpel-link="internal">sanctions against</a> Tornado Cash, which is alleged to have been utilized by agents of North Korea to launder as much as $7 billion in crypto assets.</p>
<h2>This Wasn&#8217;t the First Time for the U.S.</h2>
<p>Brian Nelson – Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence – explained during the process:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite public assurances otherwise, Tornado Cash has repeatedly failed to impose effective controls designed to stop it from laundering funds for malicious cyber actors on a regular basis and without basic measures to address its risks. The Treasury will continue to aggressively pursue actions against mixers that launder virtual currency for criminals and those who assist them.</p></blockquote>
