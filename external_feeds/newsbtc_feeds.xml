					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is slowly moving higher above $27,000. BTC could start a strong increase if it clears the $27,200 resistance zone. Bitcoin is attempting a fresh increase above the $27,000 level. The price is trading above $27,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $27,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a major increase if it clears the $27,200 and $27,400 resistance levels. Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break Bitcoin price remained well-bid above the $26,500 level. BTC formed a base and started a recovery wave above the $26,850 resistance zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $27,269 swing high to the $26,536 low. Bitcoin price is now trading above $27,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. It is also showing a few positive signs above the $27,000 level. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $27,100 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $27,269 swing high to the $26,536 low. The next major resistance is near the $27,150 level. There is also a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $27,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. A close above the trend line might send the price toward the $27,400 resistance zone. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance is near $27,550, above which the price might start a strong increase toward the $28,000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $28,500 level. Fresh Decline in BTC? If Bitcoin’s price fails to clear the $27,150 resistance, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $26,900 level and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The next major support is near the $26,550 zone, below which the price might revisit the $26,350 support. In the stated case, there is a risk of a move toward the $25,800 level. Any more losses might take Bitcoin toward the $25,500 level in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $26,900, followed by $26,550.

					<description><![CDATA[Everyone is looking for an edge when trading crypto. In a new video, a Bitcoin indicator designed for finding precise market turning points is used to turn $5 into $34,000. The results are a shocking 88% success rate and more than 679,000% ROI. Let’s take a closer look. About The Bitcoin Indicator Used: Fisher Transform The Fisher TransformFisher Transform was created by John Elhers and first mentioned in the November 2002 Issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities Magazine. The tool attempts to make sense of unpredictable price movements by using statistics. The indicator takes price data and transforms it into a Gaussian normal distribution. All this means is that the tool tries to make the price data look like a more organized pattern that can be easier to understand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally In addition to using the tool’s turning points for buy and sell signals, passing through the zero line is also a sign that a trend is strengthening. While the tool is highly effective, combining its signals with Japanese candlesticks, chart patterns, and Elliott Wave Principle can improve results. The monthly Fisher Transform &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Turning $5 Of Bitcoin Into $34,000 In the video, the monthly Fisher Transform is used to generate buy and sell signals when the trigger line crosses above the fisher line from below or above, respectively. The tool makes several bad trades. It notably loses some money it has earned on the way up at the second Bitcoin top in 2021. Despite a couple slip ups, the Fisher Transform turns $5 into $34,000 in the end. Over $30,000 is added during the best trade.

					<description><![CDATA[Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg, has highlighted Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) historical patterns of boom and bust, which are closely tied to liquidity. According to McGlone, Bitcoin&#8217;s current price level of around $27,000 may be at risk of reversion, considering that it was only $7,000 at the end of 2019 before the massive liquidity pump in 2020. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Records Surge In New Active Addresses, But Onchain Activity Takes A Dive Bitcoin Faces Unprecedented Risk? McGlone&#8217;s analysis also indicates that Bitcoin&#8217;s downward trajectory, as demonstrated by its 52-week moving average, contrasts with the upward trend it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. This suggests that the cryptocurrency is susceptible to booms when liquidity is abundant but vulnerable to busts when liquidity is removed. As such, McGlone recommends respecting the down-sloping 52-week mean in assessing Bitcoin&#8217;s direction bias. Despite the recent bank run, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has tightened twice, which may indicate the central bank&#8217;s tenacity, McGlone points out that slumping copper and cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are paying heed to the warning, which contrasts notably with the resilient stock market. Furthermore, in a recent interview, McGlone warned that Bitcoin could potentially experience a significant decline and return to its 2019 rally starting point of around $7,000. McGlone cites the drying up of liquidity and rising interest rates as key factors that could lead to a mean reversion for Bitcoin. While acknowledging the potential for Bitcoin to rebound, McGlone notes that the cryptocurrency has yet to exhibit strong divergence from other assets and suggests that investors should wait for a significant drop in the S&#38;P 500 and copper before considering a long position in Bitcoin. Looking at the facts of Bitcoin, McGlone notes that before the massive liquidity pump in 2020, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s average price in 2019 was around $7,000. It subsequently surged to $60,000 before settling at its current level of $27,000. While Bitcoin is still trading at four times its 2019 average price, McGlone cautions that the risk of mean reversion remains and suggests that investors should exercise caution in the current market environment. BTC’s ABC Pattern Could Signal Consolidation And Potential For Upside Crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe has assessed Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price action and suggests that the ABC pattern could technically be complete for BTC. The C wave went lower than the initial A wave, and they are approximately the same length from a price drop perspective. The lowest wick was only $500 off the base case, and the price seems to have entered consolidation just as expected, albeit higher. Van de Poppe notes that C waves having approximately the same length as the A wave is uncommon, and sometimes the C wave can go much deeper than the A wave. However, at this point, it is worth considering that the bottom of the C wave may be in. If another drop is lower, it should happen in the first half of this week.  If the price breaks above $27,700 or even flips the descending trendline, that could be early signs that consolidation is ending, and Bitcoin’s price is ready for continuation upwards. The ultimate level to flip for higher conviction is $29,000, and RSI is above 50. Related Reading: How Does Current Bitcoin Rally Compare With Historical Ones? On the other hand, if there is a daily candle close below $16,700, another leg down becomes more likely, and Van de Poppe&#8217;s target for that would still be $24,000 &#8211; $25,3000. Van de Poppe emphasizes that both scenarios are bullish over the medium timeframe (months) as long as Bitcoin&#8217;s price does not drop and stays under $22,000 in a sustained manner.

<p>On the other hand, if there is a daily candle close below $16,700, another leg down becomes more likely, and Van de Poppe&#8217;s target for that would still be $24,000 &#8211; $25,3000. Van de Poppe emphasizes that both scenarios are bullish over the medium timeframe (months) as long as Bitcoin&#8217;s price does not drop and stays under $22,000 in a sustained manner.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite the prevailing selling pressure in the cryptocurrency market, Litecoin has emerged as a standout performer. While the past 24 hours have not witnessed significant movement in the LTC price, the weekly chart reveals an appreciation of nearly 4%. A significant breakthrough occurred as Litecoin surpassed the crucial $90 price level, signaling a positive shift in its price. Technical analysis suggests that the bulls hold sway over the price action, with demand and accumulation indicators displaying positive signals on the daily chart. Related Reading: Role Reversal: Ethereum Defies Expectations With Lower Volatility Than Bitcoin Most altcoins, including Litecoin, have exhibited similar price patterns influenced by the fluctuations of Bitcoin. Therefore, sustaining the LTC price above the $90 mark will depend on the overall strength of the broader market. Should Bitcoin reclaim the $27,000 zone, it could pave the way for Litecoin to overcome its significant overhead resistance in subsequent trading sessions. While buyers of LTC currently maintain a favorable position, it is important to note that a slight push from the bears could potentially drive the price below $90, prompting bearish activity. However, the increased market capitalization of Litecoin in the recent session suggests that buyers are currently in control. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Litecoin (LTC) was valued at $91.02. The altcoin&#8217;s successful move above the $90 threshold has strengthened the bulls, who are now pushing prices even higher. However, a formidable barrier stands at $92.8. Surmounting this resistance level could potentially propel LTC toward the $97 mark. Conversely, declining the current price level would push the altcoin below $90. Should this occur, support might be found at around $86. The recent session&#8217;s trading volume of LTC was positive (green), indicating a growing demand for the coin. Technical Analysis Buyers have displayed consistent confidence in Litecoin (LTC) as the asset&#8217;s price has improved. This positive sentiment is reflected in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), positioned above the half-line and just below the 60 mark. This indicates more buyers than sellers, reinforcing the optimistic outlook. Moreover, LTC&#8217;s price remains above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers are driving the market&#8217;s momentum. Additionally, LTC has managed to stay above the 50-SMA (yellow) and the 200-SMA (green) lines, pointing towards increased demand for the asset. Litecoin (LTC) demonstrated buy signals alongside other technical indicators, suggesting favorable market conditions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) revealed the formation of green signal bars, indicating positive momentum and a bullish trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Shrinks To Historical Levels, Violent Move Incoming? Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands, a volatility indicator, displayed wide bands, indicating increased price volatility and fluctuation. This implies that LTC is unlikely to trade within a narrow price range, as there is potential for significant price swings. Featured Image From UnSplash, Charts From TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum&#8217;s (ETH) Beacon Chain has seen significant inflows since staking withdrawals were enabled on April 12th, with over $7.7 billion worth of Ethereum deposited into the contract. This is despite some initial predictions of a flood of outflows following the Shanghai Upgrade. The Beacon Chain is a core component of Ethereum 2.0, the next generation of the Ethereum blockchain. It is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain responsible for coordinating validators, validating transactions, and proposing and finalizing blocks in the Ethereum network. Related Reading: Dogecoin Transaction Count Rises 60X, But Why Are Prices Down? Ethereum Beacon Chain Defies Critics According to the research firm Arkham Intel, The total amount of deposited Ether now exceeds the April 12th balance by around 1.25 million ETH, with daily deposits varying widely, sometimes reaching up to 225,000 ETH (over $400 million in a single day). The inflows chart shows a noticeable spike following the Shapella upgrade, which coincided with the full enablement of withdrawals from the Beacon Chain. At the forefront of these deposits is Lido&#8217;s stETH address &#8220;0xae7&#8221;, which has consistently been the top depositor with a lifetime deposit amount of well over $15 billion, accounting for over a third of the ETH locked in the deposit contract, according to Arkham.  Following the enabling of stETH Unstaking, Lido&#8217;s deposit address has now been transferred to a new address, “0xfdd”, which has already become the 4th deposit address since April, with a total deposit amount of over 214,000 ETH, or over $386 million, despite only being active for the past three days. Furthermore, the growth of Ethereum 2.0 and the Beacon Chain has been accompanied by a surge in staking services and Liquid Staking Tokens with Frax. This stablecoin project aims to provide a more stable and reliable alternative to traditional fiat currencies, being one of the notable players in this space. Frax offers a product called frxETH, which allows users to stake their ETH and receive liquid-staked ETH tokens (sfrxETH) in return. Although Frax ranks 14th on the leaderboard of depositors, their total stake of 72,400 ETH since April 1st represents a significant portion of their total Frax ETH supply, accounting for 33.6% of the total frxETH supply of 215,000. The growth of staking services and liquid staking tokens is a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem, as it provides users with more options for earning rewards on their ETH holdings. This growth is also a testament to the popularity of Ethereum 2.0 and the Beacon Chain, which offer a more efficient and sustainable network for decentralized applications. ETH&#8217;s Price Action Suggests A Bearish Future According to Michael Van de Poppe, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, ETH’s price resembles more of a bear flag than a consolidation pattern. He believes that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is higher on ETH, and when combined with the chart pattern, it is likely that ETH will experience another leg down, making it more probable than Bitcoin (BTC). Van de Poppe points out that for him to change his mind about ETH, the resistance level that needs to be broken is $1,867. However, if the candle closes below $1,735, there is a high likelihood of continuation toward the range of $1,675 to $1,712, with the lower $1600 as the next potential support level.

Despite the current short-term uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, the long-term outlook for Ethereum and the broader digital asset industry remains positive. However, while it can be challenging to predict short-term price movements, Michael Van de Poppe&#8217;s analysis suggests that the short-term outlook for Ethereum may be bearish.

		<title>Solana (SOL) Records Surge In New Active Addresses, But Onchain Activity Takes A Dive</title>

					<description><![CDATA[The Solana (SOL) blockchain has recently witnessed a divergence in its on-chain activity and the number of new addresses joining its network. Despite an impressive surge in new addresses, SOL&#8217;s on-chain activity experienced a decline during May. Meanwhile, the asset&#8217;s price has also mirrored its on-chain activity as SOL has been in a downtrend in the past week, down by nearly 10%. On-Chain Activity Defies New Address Metrics As of this month (May), Solana demonstrated growth in its user base, with 5.4 million new addresses joining the blockchain. This surge represents the highest number of new addresses added since October 2022, hinting at a surge in interest in the Solana blockchain. Typically, a surge in new addresses suggests strong fundamentals for a blockchain, reflecting growing adoption and community engagement. Related Reading: Billions Of Dollars Tokenized Bitcoin Moved To Ethereum, BSC, And Solana However, while Solana experienced a surge in new addresses, its on-chain activity declined during the same period. Data from The Block, a prominent blockchain analytics tool, reveals that the on-chain activity on the Solana network dropped in May, contrasting the influx of new participants. On-chain activity refers to the transactions, smart contract interactions, and other operations occurring on the blockchain. The decrease in on-chain activity raises questions about the factors influencing Solana&#8217;s blockchain&#8217;s overall engagement and usage and why growth in activity has failed to impact its price positively.  Unique Circumstances For SOL Solana&#8217;s situation is unique due to the divergence between the increasing number of addresses and the decline in SOL&#8217;s price. While new addresses often correlate with positive growth indicators for cryptocurrencies, SOL&#8217;s price experienced a more than 10% drop since the beginning of May. Starting the month at $21.71, SOL&#8217;s price currently trades at $19.68. Over the past week, the asset has plummeted by 8.2%. SOL has dropped from a high of $21.38 seen last Monday to trade below $20 at the time of writing.  Solana&#8217;s market capitalization has also plunged in the past seven days. SOL&#8217;s market cap has fallen nearly 10% from a cap high of $217 billion to a high of $8.4 billion last Monday. Meanwhile, its daily trading volume has surged in the past few days. From $100 million and $150 million a few days ago to nearly $300 million in the last 24 hours. The unique decoupling between Solana&#8217;s new address growth and price performance caught the crypto community&#8217;s attention.  Related Reading: Solana Co-Founder Pitches New Way Of Meme Coin Distribution Notably, Several factors could contribute to Solana&#8217;s contrasting trends. Market dynamics, investor sentiment, and external market factors may have influenced SOL&#8217;s price decline. Additionally, while the surge in new addresses indicates growing interest, it is crucial to consider the nature of these addresses. Analyzing the activity associated with the new addresses, such as trading or long-term holding, could provide further insights into the situation.

<p>Typically, a surge in new addresses suggests strong fundamentals for a blockchain, reflecting growing adoption and community engagement.</p>

<p>However, while Solana experienced a surge in new addresses, its on-chain activity declined during the same period. Data from The Block, a prominent blockchain analytics tool, reveals that the on-chain activity on the Solana network dropped in May, contrasting the influx of new participants.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-534458 size-medium" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-17.26.55-460x311.png" alt="Solana on-chain activity." width="460" height="311" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-17.26.55-460x311.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-17.26.55-860x582.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-17.26.55-768x520.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-17.26.55-1536x1040.png 1536w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-17.26.55-750x508.png 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-17.26.55-1140x772.png 1140w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-at-17.26.55.png 1615w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"/>
<p>On-chain activity refers to the transactions, smart contract interactions, and other operations occurring on the blockchain. The decrease in on-chain activity raises questions about the factors influencing Solana&#8217;s blockchain&#8217;s overall engagement and usage and why growth in activity has failed to impact its price positively. </p>
<h2>Unique Circumstances For SOL</h2>
<p>Solana&#8217;s situation is unique due to the divergence between the increasing number of addresses and the decline in SOL&#8217;s price. While new addresses often correlate with positive growth indicators for cryptocurrencies, SOL&#8217;s price experienced a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-retests-multi-month-trend-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">more than 10% drop</a> since the beginning of May. </p>
<p>Starting the month at $21.71, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-prediction-solana-drops-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">SOL&#8217;s price</a> currently trades at $19.68. Over the past week, the asset has plummeted by 8.2%. SOL has dropped from a high of $21.38 seen last Monday to trade below $20 at the time of writing. </p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wE2fpzuS/" alt="Solana (SOL)’s price chart on TradingView" width="2768" height="1556"/>
<p>Solana&#8217;s market capitalization has also plunged in the past seven days. SOL&#8217;s market cap has fallen nearly 10% from a cap high of $217 billion to a high of $8.4 billion last Monday. Meanwhile, its daily <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-price-holds-ultra-strong-target-25-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">trading</a> volume has surged in the past few days.</p>
<p>From $100 million and $150 million a few days ago to nearly $300 million in the last 24 hours. The unique decoupling between Solana&#8217;s new address growth and price performance caught the crypto community&#8217;s attention. </p>

<p>Notably, Several factors could contribute to Solana&#8217;s contrasting trends. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-co-founder-new-way-meme-coin-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Market dynamics</a>, investor sentiment, and external market factors may have influenced SOL&#8217;s price decline. </p>
<p>Additionally, while the surge in new addresses indicates growing interest, it is crucial to consider the nature of these addresses. Analyzing the activity associated with the new addresses, such as trading or long-term holding, could provide further insights into the situation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#8217;s how the current Bitcoin rally stacks up against the previous ones in terms of the drawdowns it has experienced so far. The Current Bitcoin Rally Has Seen A Peak Drawdown Of -18.6% So Far In a recent tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode compared the latest Bitcoin rally with the ones seen throughout the entire history of the cryptocurrency. Generally, rallies are compared using metrics like the percentage price uplifts recorded during them or the amount of time that they lasted (which may be measured in terms of the blocks produced, as is done when looking at cycles in terms of halvings). Here, however, Glassnode has taken a different approach that provides a new perspective on these rallies. The comparison basis between the price surges here is the drawdowns that each of them experienced across their spans. Note that these drawdowns aren&#8217;t to be confused with the cyclical drawdowns that are used to measure how the price has declined since the bull run top. The drawdowns in question are the obstacles that the cryptocurrency encountered while the rallies were still ongoing, and are hence, those that the coin eventually managed to overcome. Related Reading: Prices Limit And Slow Down The Number Of BTC ‘Wholecoiners?’ Here is a chart that shows the degree of drawdowns that each of the historical bull markets experienced, and also where the current rally stands in comparison to them: Looks like the value of the metric hasn't been too high for the latest rally so far &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter The five bull rallies here are as follows: genesis to 2011 (the very first rally), 2011-2013, 2015-2017, 2018-2021 (the last rally), and 2022 cycle+ (the ongoing one). The analytics firm here has taken the bottom of each of the bear markets as the start of the next bull rallies. This means that parts of the cycle that some may not consider as part of the proper bull run are also included. The main example of this would be the April 2019 rally, which is often considered its own thing but is clubbed with the last Bitcoin bull market in the above chart. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the deepest drawdown that occurred during the first bull market measured around -49.4%. The next run, the 2011 to 2013 bull, experienced an even larger obstacle of a -71.2% plunge midway through it. The next one (2015-2017) then only saw a drawdown of -36%, but the drawdown was again up at -62.6% for the run that followed it (that is, the latest bull market).

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin&#8217;s on-chain transaction count is up more than 60X from roughly 20,000 transactions as of May 1 to over 1.20 million on May 20, BitInfoCharts data shows. 60X Spike In Transaction Count The present spike represents a 60X expansion in the Dogecoin transaction count, a noteworthy development primarily due to the launch of Ordinals on the proof-of-work blockchain. The spike in Dogecoin&#8217;s transactions coincided with the launch of Ordinals on May 10. With Ordinals now on Dogecoin, another proof-of-work blockchain using the same consensus style as Bitcoin, users can create a new token based on the DRC-20 system. These tokens represent unique assets like texts, images, or videos. Crucially, users don&#8217;t have to use smart contracts to mint them. However, despite the exponential increase in transaction count, DOGE prices are stable, moving horizontally, and relatively unchanged in the last three weeks. The coin is also down 31% from April 2023 peaks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Multiple Attempts At $0.10: Will The Barrier Finally Be Broken? Dogecoin is the first meme coin created as a joke and launched in 2013. But over the years, it has gained a significant following and endorsement, including from Elon Musk, the billionaire technology investor.  DOGE, the native currency of Dogecoin, is one of the largest cryptocurrency networks whose market capitalization places it among the top 10 coins. As of May 22, DOGE had a market capitalization of $10.1 billion and is more valuable than Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain, and Solana, a smart contracting platform, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ordinals On Dogecoin The DRC-20 standard is inspired by the more popular ERC-20 standard in Ethereum. Tokens complying with the DRC-20 on the Dogecoin platform are fungible and can be transferred. With these tokens, users can &#8220;inscribe&#8221; files, attaching them to the smallest unit of Dogecoin called &#8220;shibes.&#8221; These unique files represent various assets, including texts, images, videos, applications, and much more. Inscribed files, confirmed by Dogecoin miners and added to the blockchain, are unique and comparable to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The rise of DRC-20 tokens on Dogecoin explains why there has been a sharp spike in the number of on-chain transactions over the last 12 days, as trackers show. To illustrate, BitInfoCharts data shows that the number of on-chain transactions on May 10 stood at 48,500. However, the number has steadily risen in the last 12 days, peaking at 1.2 million on May 20.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset in the cryptocurrency sector, is currently captivating traders&#8217; attention as volatility gauges indicate an intriguing shift in market dynamics.  Contrary to the customary pattern, these indicators are suggesting that Ether may experience relatively smaller near-term price fluctuations compared to Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg. This unexpected reversal has injected a fresh element of anticipation and curiosity among investors, who are now closely monitoring the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Struggles To Initiate A Breakout: Will It Defy Resistance And Rebound? The Bitcoin Volatility Index. Source: T3 Index. Narrowing Gap Between Ethereum And Bitcoin Volatility The T3 Ether Volatility Index, an innovative tool, lies at the core of this phenomenon. It has emerged as an indispensable barometer for assessing and foreseeing price volatility in the Ether market. The data compiled by Bloomberg reveals that the difference in volatility between Ether and Bitcoin, as measured by the 180-day realized or historical volatility, is currently at its smallest since 2020. Furthermore, this difference is only marginally positive, indicating a remarkably close alignment between the volatility of Ether and Bitcoin. The Ether Volatility Index. Source: T3 Index. &#160; Caroline Mauron, co-founder of crypto derivatives platform OrBit Markets, told the publication: “Lower volatility typically helps institutional investors to allocate more capital to crypto, as it becomes cheaper to buy protection and manage exposures&#8230; the volatility spread compression may drive more exposure to Ether from long-term investors.” Implications Of Ethereum Price Fluctuation The changing flux of Ether&#8217;s volatility behavior have significant implications. Notably, the Bitcoin and Ether implied volatility indexes, which rely on options pricing, have experienced declines after reaching recent highs in March.  However, Ether&#8217;s implied volatility has decreased at a faster pace. Additionally, a broader measurement of cross-asset fluctuations in global markets has also witnessed a decline. The implications of Ether&#8217;s changing volatility behavior are multifaceted. The faster decline in Ether&#8217;s implied volatility suggests that market participants have become less uncertain or less anxious about the future price movements of Ether compared to Bitcoin. This could be influenced by various factors such as regulatory developments, market maturity, or growing investor confidence in Ether&#8217;s long-term potential. ETHUSD trading at $1,812.

This could impact investment decisions and trading strategies, as market participants may adjust their risk management approaches and allocation of resources based on the evolving volatility landscape.

<h2><strong>Narrowing Gap Between Ethereum And Bitcoin Volatility</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://t3index.com/indexes/bit-vol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">T3 Ether Volatility Index</a>, an innovative tool, lies at the core of this phenomenon. It has emerged as an indispensable barometer for assessing and foreseeing price volatility in the Ether market.</p>
<p>The data compiled by Bloomberg reveals that the difference in volatility between Ether and Bitcoin, as measured by the 180-day realized or historical volatility, is currently at its smallest since 2020. Furthermore, this difference is only marginally positive, indicating a remarkably close alignment between the volatility of Ether and Bitcoin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caroline Mauron, co-founder of crypto derivatives platform OrBit Markets, told the publication:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Lower volatility typically helps institutional investors to allocate more capital to crypto, as it becomes cheaper to buy protection and manage exposures&#8230; the volatility spread compression may drive more exposure to Ether from long-term investors.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Implications Of Ethereum Price Fluctuation</strong></h2>
<p>The changing flux of Ether&#8217;s volatility behavior have significant implications. Notably, the Bitcoin and Ether implied volatility indexes, which rely on options pricing, have experienced declines after reaching recent highs in March. </p>
<p>However, Ether&#8217;s implied volatility has decreased at a faster pace. Additionally, a broader measurement of cross-asset fluctuations in global markets has also witnessed a decline.</p>
<p>The implications of Ether&#8217;s changing volatility behavior are multifaceted. The faster decline in Ether&#8217;s implied volatility suggests that market participants have become less uncertain or less anxious about the future price movements of Ether compared to Bitcoin. This could be influenced by various factors such as regulatory developments, market maturity, or growing investor confidence in Ether&#8217;s long-term potential.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the broader decrease in cross-asset swings indicates a potential reduction in risk aversion among investors, as they perceive a more stable and predictable market environment. This could impact investment decisions and trading strategies, as market participants may adjust their risk management approaches and allocation of resources based on the evolving volatility landscape.</p>
<p>The changing <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-sees-low-volatility-after-1760-bounce-what-will-bulls-do-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">volatility of Ether</a>, as reflected in the Bitcoin and Ether implied volatility indexes and the broader measure of cross-asset swings, highlight the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The bearish pressure in Chainlink (LINK) since April 19, 2023, seems to have ended recently. Notably, the asset dropped from $8.57 to a low of $6.37, representing a dip of 25.67% between April and May 11. However, a strong recovery in the LINK market started on May 12 till date. On May 21, 2023, the coin rose to a local high of $6.782, changing the trend to favor the bulls. As the bulls take back control of the market, the price of LINK has increased significantly, giving the investors/traders hope and creating positive sentiment. Bulls Build Strong Momentum Chainlink (LINK) is a leading cryptocurrency that connects smart contracts with real-world data. LINK has demonstrated exceptional performance in the crypto industry, boosting its market capitalization significantly. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Resurfaces After 2-Year Hiatus, Stakes $7.4 Million In ETH The price of Chainlink is $6.48 today, May 22, 2023, with an estimated market cap of $3.35 Billion. LINK&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume is up within the last 24 hours by 80.93%, indicating high trading activity in the market.  Currently, Chainlink’s Fear &#38; Greed Index is 76% at Extreme Greed, suggesting that the market sentiment is leaning toward more buying sentiment. This means that investors and traders may be more optimistic about the market&#8217;s future and are more inclined to take risks. One of the key factors contributing to the bullish sentiment around LINK is the general market sentiment toward cryptocurrency. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates the market still favors the bears. Also, LINK is currently trading below both its 200-Day and 50-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which shows a bearish trend in the market. This also indicates that both long and short-term trends are bearish. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) confirms a strong bullish momentum as its trades above the signal line. Moreover, the histogram validates the bullish sentiment with a positive trading value and bars above zero. LINK oscillates between its direct support and resistance levels of $6.212 and $6.773, respectively. The next significant support level is $5.404, while its next resistance level is $7.5. With added momentum from either side, bulls or bears, LINK may hit these levels soon. Chainlink Whales Are On Accumulating Spree According to the on-chain data, whales are strongly bagging LINK into their purse, despite the last dip in the asset. Data from Santiment shows that the 10,000-10,000,000 key whales are accumulating more coins. This development is encouraging, considering the state of the asset. It might drive up the demand for LINK as investors will be more optimistic. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Juicy Capital Inflows – An Imminent Rebound in Sight? Generally, the number of whales on the LINK network has been on the rise since 2020. Despite the bear market, the number of whales who stayed with LINK never dropped a bit. Even with the limited liquidity and funding, the growing presence of whales on the network could fuel further momentum in Chainlink, leading to a rally for the cryptocurrency.
