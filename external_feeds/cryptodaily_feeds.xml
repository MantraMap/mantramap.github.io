			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Beyond its ground-breaking features, Uwerx's developers' agile methodology approach has significantly contributed to the project's success. They have been so committed to promoting Uwerx&rsquo;s vision and purpose that investors and users could completely trust them and buy into the project.</p>
<p class="s6">This was part of why the Uwerx launch was overwhelmingly successful, surpassing expectations and initial forecasts. The developers are back to work and ready to take Uwerx to the next level.</p>
<p class="s6">However, they witnessed a setback as Uwerx was attacked. The team has yet again shown commitment by quickly and efficiently developing recovery strategies and plans. This article will detail the launch, updates, the hack, and Uwerx&rsquo;s road to recovery.</p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s Successful Launch: Developers Set To Renounce Smart Contract Ownership
<p class="s6">After so much anticipation, Uwerx finally launched on August 1, 2023. The launch was successful, as everyone wanted to become a WERX holder. Also, investors and users made tons of profits with all the bonuses that were up.</p>
<p class="s6">The developers released updates on what to expect next from Uwerx as soon as the launch ended. Uwerx has finally deployed liquidity on Uniswap. The Uwerx Vault, which received positive feedback from 84% of the community, will soon be available as the smart contracts await a thorough audit. </p>
<p class="s6">To show their commitment to Uwerx&rsquo;s community, the developers immediately began the 25-year liquidity locking they promised to do once Uwerx launched. They are also ready to denounce smart contract ownership when Uwerx goes live on centralized exchanges. The team has submitted their applications to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to facilitate this. </p>
<p class="s6">The team is working to ensure the Uwerx platform is completed immediately. They are working on the core functionality design, focusing on Freelancer, Client, and Agency Dashboards, Project Management, and Additional Settings Pages. </p>
<p class="s6">Once this is finished, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with functions will be released to the community for testing. Based on the feedback obtained, they will proceed with the premium design. </p>
<p class="s6">There will be a buyback campaign that will scale accordingly to provide support for Uwerx. It will happen weekly, although the dates and times will not be released to avoid anyone taking unfair advantage of the system.</p>
Uwerx Gets Exploited
<p class="s6">On August 2, Uwerx reported it got hacked, with the hacker stealing around $327,000. The attacker flash-loaned 20,000 ETH, which he swapped for 5,053,637 WERX. He then sent 4,429,817 WERX to the Uniswap pool. This amount was ten times the prior balance.</p>
<p class="s6">Afterward, he used the skim() function of Uniswap with the address 0x00...1 as the &ldquo;to&rdquo; address. He also used the transfer function of the Uwerx contract, which first modifies a sender&rsquo;s balance. </p>
<p class="s6">Since the &ldquo;to&rdquo; address was a UniswapPoolAddress (0x00...1), an extra 1% of the initial amount was burned. As a result, there was an imbalance that the attacker took advantage of to gain 176 ETH ($327,000).</p>
Uwerx Maintains Momentum As It Sets To Relaunch
<p class="s6">Despite the hack, Uwerx continues to shine as it devises ways to tackle the hack and maintain its momentum. Once they noticed the hack, they immediately alerted SolidProof and InterFiNetwork, their auditors. Also, the team contacted PeckShieldAlert and SlowMist_Team directly on Twitter. </p>
<p class="s6">The team began by putting out a white-hat bounty, stating the attacker should return 80% of the exploited funds and keep 20%. </p>
<p class="s6">A new WERX will be relaunched, and its platform will have more robust security measures. As to the relaunch, there will be a new contract address, which will be released to the community soon. </p>
<p class="s6">However, the contract address will be audited twice by reputable companies and once by an independent contractor. Due to a change in the contract address, the Uwerx Vault smart contracts are being altered, after which they will be audited before being released to the public.</p>
<p class="s6">The new WERX will be deployed on the Polygon network instead of Uniswap, on which it is currently deployed. This will enable token holders to easily use WERX on the Uwerxplatform without having to bridge, and it will also lower gas fees. </p>
<p class="s6">However, those who bought WERX on Uniswap will not be abandoned. The team has decided to airdrop the tokens at the end of the vesting period to ensure they still benefit. They also assure those who bought WERX during the presale that they are safe and will be unaffected by the relaunch.</p>
<p class="s6">The new WERX will be deployed with more liquidity. To do this, the funds reserved for the buyback campaign will be directed to liquidity. Also, the team is proposing a no-burn tax and a sliding sell tax, of which 100% will be directed to liquidity. </p>
<p class="s6">A poll is already up on Uwerx&rsquo;s Twitter page and Telegram channel, asking the community if they support a sliding sell tax wholly directed to liquidity. Another poll also asks the community how long the vesting period should be. </p>
<p class="s6">These polls will end on August 13, after which the development of the new WERX will commence on August 14. The team also welcomes feedback or opinions, which can be sent to feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s6">Also, there will be press releases this week and another major announcement on August 21 to update the community on the new WERX development and plans for the relaunch. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx platform development is ongoing, and the team has completed certain sections like Settings, Security, Help Center, Login, Privacy Policy, Create Account, and Finished Payments.</p>
<p class="s6">The WERX allocations will also be changed, and the new allocation is:</p>
● Presale: 57% (427,500,000)
● User Performance Incentives: 6% (45,000,000) 
● Liquidity Reserve: 14% (105,500,000)
● Marketing: 9% (67,500,000) 
● Team Tokens: 6% (45,000,000) 
● Partnership Incentives: 2% (15,000,000)
● Joining Incentives: 6% ( 45,000,000) 
<p class="s6">At the end of the presale, 25,499,071 WERX will be burned. The airdrop and vesting schedules were shifted, and the new schedules have been released. Uwerx&rsquo;s whitepaper will also be modified to reflect the ongoing changes. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is on to big things, and once the polls are concluded on August 13, the team will announce the specific details of the new WERX, as they are committed to launching it as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx&rsquo;s dedication throughout this period has been incredible. Their efforts in tackling this challenge have removed all forms of doubt and fear the community initially had. No wonder its community has continued to gather momentum, growing to over 2,500 Telegram members and 2,000 Twitter followers.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx remains focused on its vision, which is to be a change in freelancing, and no matter what, it is resolved to achieve this purpose. So why not throw in your support? Be a part of this value-driven community by following the links below:</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bank of America reacts to the launch of PayPal&rsquo;s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin PYUSD and argues that the asset is not likely to be used widely, at least not in the short term.</p>
<p>PayPal&rsquo;s recent groundbreaking announcement about the launch of its U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin PYUSD has provoked its share of criticism around the world. While it does seem a significant step towards crypto adoption, some say that PayPal won&rsquo;t see much success any time soon.</p>
<p>One of the U.S. largest banks, Bank of America, described the main reasons why PayPal USD is not likely to witness immediate adoption in its recent research report.&nbsp;</p>
Competing Against CDBCs
<p>First of all, Bank of America&rsquo;s analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss explained that the PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin might face intense competition on the market:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and yield-bearing stablecoins increases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is true that numerous countries are actively exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could potentially compete with stablecoins as both are based on similar technologies and pegged to fiat currencies. Only this year, countries such as Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Japan, the UK, among others have reported new developments on the rollout of their CBDCs. There are speculations that the U.S. might also be working on its CBDC, even though some of the country&rsquo;s presidential candidates have claimed to be against it.</p>
Competing Against Other Stablecoins
<p>Besides, there are many other stablecoins PYUSD will have to compete with. Yield-bearing stablecoins are now especially attractive to investors, according to Bank of America:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors may have been fine holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%.&rdquo;</p>

Dealing with Regulatory Scrutiny&nbsp;
<p>Finally, the analysts also suggested that PayPal could face regulatory troubles if traditional banks are banned from issuing stablecoins:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors are likely indifferent to which stablecoins they hold as long as the stablecoins are perceived as safe and accessible on the largest trading platforms. We do not expect PYUSD&rsquo;s launch to lead to accelerated regulatory clarity, given the stablecoin&rsquo;s issuance does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets, but the stablecoin may face regulatory headwinds if non-banks are ultimately barred from stablecoin issuance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only a day after PayPal had unveiled its stablecoin project, the U.S. Federal Reserve published new guidelines regarding the use of &ldquo;dollar tokens&rdquo; by American banks. According to the statement, in order to engage in any sort of activity linked to stablecoins, the U.S. banks will now have to receive a written supervisory non-objection from the Fed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto scammers didn&rsquo;t wait long to try and profit from the big news and flooded decentralized exchanges with fake PayPal tokens.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As cybercrimes rise in the country, Canada challenges local developers to create a secure repository for seized cryptocurrencies and NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
Challenge for Creating a Digital Asset Repository
<p>Due to a reported rise in crypto-related illegal activities across the country, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) are pursuing a solution that can facilitate the seizure and storage of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on various blockchains, according to the statement of August 10, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The RCMP requires the ability to safely and securely store digital assets that have been seized and retained, until their eventual disposition at the conclusion of any legal proceedings. The development of a centralized repository solution would allow police officers to seize these assets in a user friendly manner, while also offering significant security to prevent the theft of said assets during their storage,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

<p>The authorities dare the Canadian innovative developers to come up with a safe digital asset repository that would help the police seize and safeguard stolen assets, in an effort to decrease cryptocurrency frauds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RCMP outlines fourteen mandatory and three desirable features a proposed solution should have. The primary considerations require the repository to be able to accept and process transactions on the top 20 cryptocurrency networks by market capitalization, as well as onboard and support new blockchains in the future.</p>
<p>Other demands on the list include a native Android application; secure processes to protect assets and dispose of them if needed; daily automated verification and notifications on asset transfers; clear instructions on seizing assets for officers; and more. The RCMP also listed three NFT blockchains that must be supported by the system at this stage &ndash; Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants of the challenge can submit their idea until September 21, 2023. Up to four contracts for Phase 1 could result from the challenge. Then, only two eligible businesses will be invited to submit a proposal for Phase 2.&nbsp;</p>
Combatting Cryptocurrency-Related Crimes
<p>The main reason behind the development of the digital asset repository is the surge of crypto-related activities in Canada:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the rise of new and innovative methods to store and transfer assets, Canadian Law enforcement needs a safe and secure method to identify and seize said assets. As cryptocurrency continues to gain popularity as a transaction method and store of value in the general population, it continues to be used as a payment method for criminal activities. With ransomware/malware attacks and online scams making up the majority of these transactions. This challenge aims to leverage the private sectors innovation to develop a system used by the police to seize and store the ill-gotten gains from these criminal activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Canada is not the only country that experiences a rise in crimes linked to digital assets. For example, the FBI in the US has also recently reported numerous scams related to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, with one of the recent cases resulting in the loss of staggering $9million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, other countries are also looking for effective ways to deal with crypto crimes. One of the latest examples is a multi-agency investigation unit established by South Korea.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As cybercrimes rise in the country, Canada challenges local developers to create a secure repository for seized cryptocurrencies and NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
Challenge for Creating a Digital Asset Repository
<p>Due to a reported rise in crypto-related illegal activities across the country, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) are pursuing a solution that can facilitate the seizure and storage of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on various blockchains, according to the statement of August 10, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The RCMP requires the ability to safely and securely store digital assets that have been seized and retained, until their eventual disposition at the conclusion of any legal proceedings. The development of a centralized repository solution would allow police officers to seize these assets in a user friendly manner, while also offering significant security to prevent the theft of said assets during their storage,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

<p>The authorities dare the Canadian innovative developers to come up with a safe digital asset repository that would help the police seize and safeguard stolen assets, in an effort to decrease cryptocurrency frauds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RCMP outlines fourteen mandatory and three desirable features a proposed solution should have. The primary considerations require the repository to be able to accept and process transactions on the top 20 cryptocurrency networks by market capitalization, as well as onboard and support new blockchains in the future.</p>
<p>Other demands on the list include a native Android application; secure processes to protect assets and dispose of them if needed; daily automated verification and notifications on asset transfers; clear instructions on seizing assets for officers; and more. The RCMP also listed three NFT blockchains that must be supported by the system at this stage &ndash; Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants of the challenge can submit their idea until September 21, 2023. Up to four contracts for Phase 1 could result from the challenge. Then, only two eligible businesses will be invited to submit a proposal for Phase 2.&nbsp;</p>
Combatting Cryptocurrency-Related Crimes
<p>The main reason behind the development of the digital asset repository is the surge of crypto-related activities in Canada:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the rise of new and innovative methods to store and transfer assets, Canadian Law enforcement needs a safe and secure method to identify and seize said assets. As cryptocurrency continues to gain popularity as a transaction method and store of value in the general population, it continues to be used as a payment method for criminal activities. With ransomware/malware attacks and online scams making up the majority of these transactions. This challenge aims to leverage the private sectors innovation to develop a system used by the police to seize and store the ill-gotten gains from these criminal activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Canada is not the only country that experiences a rise in crimes linked to digital assets. For example, the FBI in the US has also recently reported numerous scams related to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, with one of the recent cases resulting in the loss of staggering $9million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, other countries are also looking for effective ways to deal with crypto crimes. One of the latest examples is a multi-agency investigation unit established by South Korea.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">A top crypto trader's bold prediction of a "glorious" Ethereum breakout has set the stage for an even more remarkable rally for $ROE, the native crypto of Borroe, an innovative AI-powered Web3 blockchain project. $ROE has emerged as a prime contender to outshine ETH in the crypto market.</p>
Borroe Finance's Unique Marketplace Takes Center Stage as $ROE Presale Gains Momentum
<p class="s11">As innovation is the driving force in the Web3 space, one project is capturing the attention of investors and blockchain analysts alike &ndash; Borroe Finance. This groundbreaking platform has introduced a unique marketplace that utilizes blockchain, tokenization, smart contracts, NFTs, and AI-powered risk assessment to revolutionize how Web3 businesses access funding. </p>
<p class="s11">As Borroe Finance continues its presale, the crypto community is excited over the potential of its native token, $ROE, to outperform even the mighty Ethereum.</p>
<p class="s11">At the heart of Borroe Finance lies its innovative marketplace, where businesses can mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing future revenue streams and outstanding invoices. </p>
<p class="s11">These NFTs are then sold at a discount, enabling Web3 startups to access upfront cash quickly and efficiently. The platform's AI-driven risk assessment and automated process ensure transparency, security, and timely funding, building confidence among investors and paving the way for the $ROE token to shine.</p>
What further sets Borroe Finance apart is its commitment to regulation and best practices. 
<p class="s11">The project proactively seeks regulatory compliance, ensuring that it operates within legal frameworks and safeguards consumer welfare. This strategic approach provides a solid foundation for investors, offering peace of mind and reducing potential risks associated with regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p class="s11">One of the standout features of Borroe Finance is its recent smart audit by BlockAudit, a top auditing firm renowned for its thorough analysis of blockchain projects. This audit underscores the project's commitment to security and trustworthiness, a vital factor in today's crypto landscape. </p>
<p class="s11">With the assurance of a reputable audit, $ROE's appeal as a safe investment option is further amplified.</p>
<p class="s11">As the crypto community looks ahead to an exciting future, $ROE presents an enticing entry point for investors seeking exposure to the Web3 revolution. Borroe Finance's experienced team, innovative solutions, and commitment to regulation make it an attractive choice for those looking to capitalize on the next big wave in the cryptocurrency market. </p>
<p class="s11">As analysts predict a "glorious" Ethereum breakout, the potential for $ROE to rally even harder and outperform ETH becomes a compelling narrative that investors can't ignore.</p>
The Successful $ROE Presale 
<p class="s13">$ROE tokenomics is a cornerstone of Borroe Finance's ecosystem, designed to empower both investors and businesses within the Web3 space. </p>
<p class="s13">With a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens residing on the Polygon (Ethereum sidechain) chain, $ROE offers a unique value proposition differentiating it from traditional investments. </p>
<p class="s13">$ROE grants holders priority access to new sales in the Borroe marketplace, discounted fees, premium features, and rewards, including recognition and awards for marketplace participation. </p>
<p class="s13">Its role in facilitating the Borroe marketplace's streamlined processes and secure transactions makes $ROE essential, ensuring seamless interactions between buyers and sellers while driving growth in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s14">The presale stages of $ROE further enhance its appeal. With Stage One offering tokens at $0.0125 each, and the preceding Beta stage having sold out at $0.01 per token, early investors have witnessed the project's momentum and potential for value appreciation. </p>
<p class="s14">As the presale progresses through different stages, each with varying token prices, the tokenomics of $ROE creates an enticing opportunity for investors to participate in the project. </p>
<p class="s14">With the potential to outperform traditional investments and provide a unique gateway to the Web3 revolution, $ROE's tokenomics align investor incentives with Borroe Finance's mission of transforming the future of funding in the crypto space.</p>

$ROE to Dwarf ETH
<p class="s3">The crypto world is excited as Bluntz, a prominent trader known for accurately predicting Bitcoin's 2018 market bottom, unveils his latest analysis that's turning heads in the Ethereum (ETH) market. </p>
<p class="s3">In a recent tweet, Bluntz highlighted a nearly year-long wedge formation in the ETH/BTC trading pair, which he believes sets the stage for a "glorious" breakout. </p>
<p class="s3">The trader expressed optimism and signaled that the breakout might already be underway, suggesting a bullish target price of over 0.07 BTC (approximately $2,101). His prediction challenges the status quo, as he believes that many market participants are underprepared for Ethereum's potential upswing, making them vulnerable to a significant price movement.</p>
<p class="s11">Notably, Bluntz believes that Ethereum's bullish momentum has the potential to drive the price to an impressive high of 0.112 BTC (approximately $3,362). </p>
<p class="s11">This projection represents a substantial leap from Ethereum's current level of $1839. Investors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly watching Ethereum's price action, anticipating a "glorious" breakout and the potential for outsized gains continue to drive excitement within the crypto market. </p>
<p class="s11">As Ethereum's breakout scenario unfolds, $ROE's journey to outperforming ETH becomes an exciting narrative investors can't overlook. This is because, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum's price movements often serve as a barometer for the broader market sentiment. </p>
<p class="s11">Ethereum's significant moves can trigger other altcoins to surge even harder and outperform the leader.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">TVL or the total value of digital assets locked in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform is often used as a metric to judge the growth of a network. A recent report shows that Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) TVL have seen an upsurge. A new project, Pomerdoge (POMD), has shown potential, but can it keep up in the highly competitive cryptocurrency world?</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Ethereum and Cardano TVL Explodes
<p class="s5">The TVL metric is often used to judge the growth of a DeFi network. Recent reports from Messari have shown that the TVL of Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) has been on the rise despite the bearish crypto market.</p>
<p class="s5">According to Messari, the TVL of Cardano has increased by 198.6% year-to-date (YTD). Cardano now has more than $175 million locked in its DeFi ecosystem. The increase in TVL has helped Cardano move from the 34th position to the 21st in overall TVL across all blockchains.</p>
<p class="s5">Messari links the growth of Cardano&rsquo;s DeFi ecosystem to the launch of stablecoins, improved programming languages, and new wallets. On the other hand, Ethereum still dominates the DeFispace as the leading network. At the time of this writing, Ethereum has more than $23.5 billion in TVL.</p>
<p class="s5">The explosive growth of Cardano and Ethereum is considered impressive due to the recent price drop in crypto prices. With the prices of Ethereum and Cardano forecasted to recover by the end of 2023, the TVL locked in their respective chains could increase further.</p>
Can Pomerdoge (POMD) Catch Up in the DeFi Space?
<p class="s5">In the already competitive DeFi space, a new project, Pomerdoge (POMD), is launching to public acclaim from market experts. There are bullish predictions for Pomerdoge because it is creating a unique niche for itself. Pomerdoge would be the first project to combine the fanfare of crypto meme coins with the fast-growing play-to-earn sector.</p>
<p class="s5">Pomerdoge is building an enthralling game where players can earn rewards and alsocommunicate via a social infrastructure. With unique, eccentric avatars called Pomerdoge, players will enter competitions in the eye-catching world of Pomerdoges. In-game products and NFTs can be sold for real money in the Pomerplace, the ecosystem's marketplace.</p>
<p class="s5">The platform is growing at an impressive rate as players have great opportunities to earn. Players can enter weekly contests and giveaways for a chance to win up to $100,000 in weekly giveaways. Experts have predicted that Pomerdoge will compete with the biggest names in DeFias it perfectly fuses entertainment and financial opportunity.</p>
<p class="s5">As a result, many analysts have predicted that Pomerdoge will become one of the P2E games and stage one of the largest rallies before the end of the year. Early forecasts estimate a 4,000% price gain for the Pomerdoge utility coin by December. Investors have a wonderful opportunity to join the Pomerdoge ecosystem before its massive rally, which is now trading at $0.007.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance Labs, the venture capital and incubation division of Binance, has plunged $5 million into the Curve DAO Token (CRV), cementing its stance in the DeFi realm.&nbsp;</p>
Support From Industry Bigwigs
<p>The $5 million investment from Binance Labs in the CRV token is part of a strategic deal under which Curve will explore deployment to the BNB Chain. With $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) and a daily volume of $215 million, Curve is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX).&nbsp;</p>
<p>CRV, the Ethereum-based utility token of the Curve DeFi protocol, serves as a linchpin for exchanging stablecoins and other ERC-20 tokens, alongside staking, boosting, and governance voting.</p>
<p>The DeFi platform was recently hit by a severe re-entrancy exploit that robbed it of over $60 million worth of funds from its liquidity pools. It affected Curve even further as several exchanges withdrew their support for the CRV token from their platforms. Binance Labs&rsquo; investment in the CRV token has somewhat reversed that effect, acting as a vote of confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has also received support from other crypto bigwigs, like Justin Sun and DCF God.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Labs' Forward-Thinking Approach
<p>Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs, underscored the partnership's significance, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi, it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration. We view this cooperation as a starting point and look forward to working together to further propel the growth of the DeFi ecosystem."</p>

Strategic Amalgamation for BNB Chain Boost
<p>Curve's multi-chain presence, capitalizing on speed and cost efficiency, is set to expand with its planned deployment to BNB Chain. This strategic move aims to bolster the growth of the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem, amplifying its influence in the DeFi landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve founder Michael Egorov noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"BNB Chain has earned a significant presence in DeFi, and is well positioned to deploy Curve's current and future products on its chain. We look forward to collaboratively fostering innovation and growth across the DeFi ecosystem."</p>

<p>The integration of Curve onto the BNB Chain will enhance scalability paving the way for handling more transactions and catering to the escalating user demand. Additionally, the alluring prospect of reduced transaction fees on BNB Chain serves as a magnet for cost-conscious users, solidifying the appeal of Curve.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>South Korean authorities have arrested the CEO of the Bitsonic crypto exchange, Jinwook Shin, for allegedly stealing $7.5 million dollars of user funds.&nbsp;</p>
Embezzlement Allegations
<p>Jinwook Shin was taken into custody by South Korean authorities on August 7th after an investigation uncovered that the CEO had been allegedly embezzling investments and deposits belonging to the exchange's users during the time period between January 2019 and May 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the initial report, Shin allegedly engaged in fraudulent activities that manipulated cryptocurrency prices and trading volume on Bitsonic, which led to the misappropriation of approximately $7.5 million (10 billion won) from user funds.&nbsp;</p>
Liquidity Issues Leads To Shutdown
<p>Despite facing liquidity problems and suspension of withdrawals on the crypto platform, Shin continued to provide cryptocurrencies to new customers. This persistence drew the attention of the Seoul cyber crime department, which alleged that Shin failed to purchase cryptocurrencies during this period, raising suspicions about the legitimacy of the exchange's operations.</p>
<p>In August 2021, the platform finally announced the closure of its operations, attributing the decision to "internal and external issues."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This announcement was followed by the shutdown of 11 domestic cryptocurrency platforms by South Korean authorities, who were investigating alleged fraudulent activities.</p>
Vice President Also Complicit
<p>The investigation further implicated the vice president of Bitsonic, who is believed to have played a role in devising a scheme to acquire the cryptocurrencies held by the CEO within the exchange system. The VP, who is referred to as Mr. A, was allegedly working hand-in-hand with Shin to buy the cryptocurrency held by the latter on the exchange platform. A shell company established in Singapore was allegedly used in the process of manipulation.</p>
Government's Stance Against Fraud And Cybercrime
<p>South Korean authorities have recently taken a tough stance against fraudulent activities within the digital asset industry. Last month, the Korea Securities Depository partnered with Code, a firm specializing in Travel Rules, to address the rise in unlawful activities within the virtual asset market. This partnership aims to promote the issuance and utilization of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) to enhance investor protection.</p>
<p>Additionally, the government has also been working on a crypto-tracking system, including an interagency investigation team, to counter cybercrime as a part of its commitment to ensuring the security and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As the investigation into the alleged embezzlement unfolds, South Korea's proactive approach against fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency sector continues to underscore the nation's commitment to fostering a secure and trustworthy digital asset environment.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US financial regulators&rsquo; attack on all things crypto continues as the Federal Reserve issues a new announcement obliging banks to jump through extremely exacting requirements in order to do business with crypto entities.</p>
<p>Referring to its recently established &ldquo;novel activities supervision program&rdquo;, the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s latest supervisory letter states that any&nbsp; banks wishing to do business in &ldquo;dollar tokens&rdquo; must obtain a written supervisory non-objection from the Fed before doing anything in line with this sort of activity.</p>
<p>This latest regulatory pronouncement might well have been inspired after seeing PayPal roll out its PYUSD stablecoin which seeks to become a bridge between fiat and Web3 for merchants and consumers alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular innovation for the dollar and crypto may have been seen as a step too far by US financial authorities, given the size of PayPal and its huge financial clout and influence.</p>
<p>The new strictures put in place by the Fed will make doing business in PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin extremely challenging and demanding, requiring any bank to "identify, measure, monitor and control the risks of its activities,".</p>
<p>The Fed will then weigh up the risks for money laundering, substantial short term redemptions, and cybersecurity risks among others.</p>
<p>Obliging all companies wanting to do such business to follow such an exacting and arduous process is likely to put a real damper on the use of PayPal&rsquo;s PYUSD stablecoin and has led to some volatility in PayPal&rsquo;s stock price.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the Fed that is acting in such a manner either. The FDIC and the OCC, both very weighty financial agencies, have also put rules into place that crypto companies, and the businesses looking to interact with them, are likely to find burdensome and difficult to comply with.</p>
Opinion
<p>The financial agencies should act to give adequate protections to businesses and consumers from the issues that can arise from such groundbreaking financial innovations in the crypto sector, but instead they are acting as kingmakers in order to favour the banking industry from which they come.</p>
<p>Crypto came into being as a creative and innovative industry that favours speed, security and privacy, and puts the consumer first. However, cumbersome and pro-bank regulations are pulling crypto companies down to the same level as their lumbering banking competitors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Huobi is doing its best to dispel the arrest and financial stability rumours that have led to a flight of funds.</p>
<p>Huobi Global, a prominent Asian crypto exchange, has found itself at the centre of some negative speculation recently. Over the past week the exchange has suffered from whispers of employee arrests, potential insolvency, and fraud allegations.</p>
The FUD
<p>The saga first unfolded when a tweet by Wu Blockchain hinted at investigations into several crypto exchange leaders by mainland authorities. At least one other Twitter account reported that multiple Huobi executives were apprehended by mainland police, with some staff even advised to exit the country.</p>
<p>In a swift response, Huobi refuted the claims. The company's representative made a request to the mentioned websites to rectify the "misinformation" and hinted at possible legal actions.</p>
<p>In a Kitco article on the subject, a message conversation between a spokesperson from Huobi and Adam Cochran of Cinneamhain Ventures was recorded. While the Huobi representative sought to avoid FUD, Cochran replied that his source was verified as a senior Tron executive, and repeated his claim that the spokesperson&rsquo;s &lsquo;colleagues&rsquo; were &ldquo;under criminal investigation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite these claims, Huobi has remained steadfast, dismissing the insolvency speculations as mere attempts to spread "fear, uncertainty, and doubt."</p>
The positives
<p>In the face of the ongoing turbulence, a Huobi representative confirmed the exchange&rsquo;s intention to pursue a VAT licence, highlighting the recent example of the introduction of a Hong Kong trading app for retail investors.</p>
<p>A substantial inflow to Huobi in USDT and USDC on August 8 and 9, as per data from Defi llama, was speculated to be from a wallet associated with Justin Sun, and has appeared to bolster investor confidence as Huobi's total locked assets made a notable rise from previous figures.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Aave community has started voting on three crucial proposals that could help significantly reduce the protocol&rsquo;s exposure to Curve Finance&rsquo;s CRV token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two out of the three proposals in question opened for voting on the 10th of August.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Proposals
<p>The move by the Aave community comes as it attempts to limit the risk posed to the protocol by the large borrowing position held by Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance. On-chain risk management platform Chaos Lab put forward the proposals. According to the platform, volatility in Curve markets had considerably increased after the recent exploit suffered by Curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CRV token is the native token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance. Curve founder Egorov had used as much as 30% of CRV&rsquo;s total market capitalization to take out nearly $60 million in loans on Aave. However, the Curve Finance hack significantly impacted the price of CRV, sending it plummeting. This made Egorov&rsquo;s position vulnerable, potentially exposing Aave to a liquidation risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The voting on the proposals is set to continue until the 12th of August. The first proposal seeks to reduce the liquidation threshold by 6% for CRV on Aave v2. This could lead to user accounts becoming subject to liquidation upon approval. The second proposal disables borrowing of CRV tokens on Polygon v3 and Ethereum. This would make it impossible to short CRV through the Aave protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two proposals to limit Aave&rsquo;s exposure have found overwhelming support in the community. So far, over 571,000 votes have been cast, with 100% of the votes in favor of limiting Aave&rsquo;s exposure to CRV.&nbsp;</p>
The Third Proposal&nbsp;
<p>With fears surrounding Egorov&rsquo;s loans, Aave&rsquo;s community is also voting on a third proposal, voting for which ends on the 11th of August. The proposal, put forward by Aave Chan founder Marc Zeller, calls on the Aave treasury to purchase $2 million worth of CRV tokens from Curve Finance. Zeller&rsquo;s reasoning for such a move is that it would signal that major DeFi players support Curve and the health of the larger DeFi ecosystem. However, this proposal has not gained as much support in the community, although a majority do support it. Currently, around 62% of votes favor the proposal, while 37% have voted against it.&nbsp;</p>
The Curve Finance Exploit&nbsp;
<p>Curve Finance suffered a major exploit at the beginning of the month, with hackers managing to siphon off millions worth of crypto. As a result of the hack, the protocol&rsquo;s CRV token saw a significant price drop, casting a long shadow on the DeFi ecosystem. The decline in CRV&rsquo;s value also put a $168 million lending position taken by Curve founder Michael Egorov at risk. If this position was liquidated, it could have disastrous consequences for the larger DeFi ecosystem, putting major protocols at risk. Following the exploit, crypto exchanges moved to suspend withdrawals, with Upbit among the first to act, suspending deposits and withdrawals of the CRV token.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, certain vulnerabilities have been discovered in some of the stablecoin pools associated with Curve (CRV). As a result, CRV is currently experiencing significant volatility. We advise exercising caution when considering any investments related to CRV. To ensure the safety of digital asset transactions, we have temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals for CRV.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Curve and Egorov found support from prominent players in the crypto space. These include Power DeFi user DCF God, Jeffrey Huang, and Tron Foundation CEO Justin Sun. All have since stepped in and purchased CRV from Egorov, resulting in the principal value of Egorov&rsquo;s loans dropping to $54 million. Justin Sun posted a message in support of Curve, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excited to assist Curve! As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed. Our joint efforts will introduce an @stusdt pool on Curve, amplifying user benefits. Together, we aim to empower the community and forge a decentralized finance!&rdquo;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Aave community has started voting on three crucial proposals that could help significantly reduce the protocol&rsquo;s exposure to Curve Finance&rsquo;s CRV token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two out of the three proposals in question opened for voting on the 10th of August.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Proposals
<p>The move by the Aave community comes as it attempts to limit the risk posed to the protocol by the large borrowing position held by Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance. On-chain risk management platform Chaos Lab put forward the proposals. According to the platform, volatility in Curve markets had considerably increased after the recent exploit suffered by Curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CRV token is the native token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance. Curve founder Egorov had used as much as 30% of CRV&rsquo;s total market capitalization to take out nearly $60 million in loans on Aave. However, the Curve Finance hack significantly impacted the price of CRV, sending it plummeting. This made Egorov&rsquo;s position vulnerable, potentially exposing Aave to a liquidation risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The voting on the proposals is set to continue until the 12th of August. The first proposal seeks to reduce the liquidation threshold by 6% for CRV on Aave v2. This could lead to user accounts becoming subject to liquidation upon approval. The second proposal disables borrowing of CRV tokens on Polygon v3 and Ethereum. This would make it impossible to short CRV through the Aave protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two proposals to limit Aave&rsquo;s exposure have found overwhelming support in the community. So far, over 571,000 votes have been cast, with 100% of the votes in favor of limiting Aave&rsquo;s exposure to CRV.&nbsp;</p>
The Third Proposal&nbsp;
<p>With fears surrounding Egorov&rsquo;s loans, Aave&rsquo;s community is also voting on a third proposal, voting for which ends on the 11th of August.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The MakerDAO founder, Rune Christensen, has announced an airdrop for the Spark Protocol&rsquo;s native SPK token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the proposal, the tokens will be released gradually, with the proposal outlining the distribution of two billion SPK tokens over the next ten years.&nbsp;</p>
The SPK Token Airdrop&nbsp;
<p>The proposal is aimed at promoting long-term engagement with the platform and outlines the eventual distribution of two billion SPK tokens over ten years in an effort to incentivize the continued usage of the Spark Protocol. The SPK token will also act as a governance token for SparkDAO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goal of the SPK pre-farming airdrop is to give users and borrow-arbers a reason to keep using Spark Protocol if the EDSR proposal to increase stability fees to 5% goes through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Rune, the proposal would be an avenue for the community to secure SPK tokens before the launch of the SubDAO, with Rune stating on X,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I posted an overview of the potential SparkDAO SPK pre-farming airdrop for early users of http://sparkprotocol.io borrowing: This would be a way to secure early SPK tokens before the SubDAOs launch (Farming not available to US and VPN users)&rdquo;</p>

Spark Expected To Become SubDAO&nbsp;
<p>Spark Protocol is a lending protocol that has been introduced by MakerDAO. The protocol provides DeFi loans, sourcing liquidity directly from Maker. As collateral, the protocol accepts several assets, such as DAI, ETH, and Staked ETH. Spark Protocol eventually aims to become a SubDAO, which marks a significant step in Maker&rsquo;s Endgame Plan. As a subDAO, Spark will be an entirely independent, decentralized autonomous organization within MakerDAO. The Endgame plan envisions the creation of several subDAOs similar to Spark, each governed by its own distinct community and token.&nbsp;</p>
A Way To Incentivize Usage&nbsp;
<p>The SubDAO tokens will be allocated to Spark borrowers and will utilize several assets as collateral, distributed proportionately towards the amount and duration of borrowing. According to Christensen, the aim is to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants whose goals are aligned with SparkDAO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants that are aligned with the mission and potential of SparkDAO.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eventual goal is to incentivize the Spark token&rsquo;s active usage, despite it offering a 5% yield on DAI deposits, also called Enhanced DAI Savings Rate. The EDSR on Spark climbed to 8% earlier in the week, resulting in a significant inflow of capital as users rushed to leverage borrowing arbitrage opportunities. This saw users borrow DAI at lower rates and then deploy it for higher yields in EDSR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maker&rsquo;s new Spark Protocol has courted controversy following its launch after it emerged that the protocol&rsquo;s terms of service actively prevented users from accessing the platform through virtual private networks (VPNs). By limiting VPN access, MakerDAO appeared to be restricting US-based users from accessing the platform.&nbsp;</p>
Maker&rsquo;s Endgame Plan&nbsp;
<p>MakerDAO&rsquo;s Endgame is a significant update planned to enhance the protocol&rsquo;s efficiency, resilience, and participation. It aims to do this by creating a strong governance equilibrium that would act as the bedrock for SubDAOs, helping parallelize growth and innovation in a community-driven ecosystem. In the short term, Endgame hopes to enhance the supply of DAI to over 100 billion within three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also aims to ensure that the Maker ecosystem is anchored in a vibrant and independent DAO economy that could grow at an accelerating rate. At the same time, it would also maintain governance equilibrium, ensuring it could scale to any size.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto exchange Bittrex has agreed to a $24 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bringing to a close allegations of offering unregistered securities to American investors.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement, made on Thursday, comes within two months of Bittrex's bankruptcy filing and follows the trend of regulatory scrutiny facing cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
Bittrex's Position and SEC's Allegations
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bittrex, which filed for bankruptcy in May, was sued by the SEC earlier this year. The regulator's charges revolved around the simultaneous operation of the company as a securities exchange, broker, and clearinghouse without appropriate registration, allegations that have also been leveledd at Coinbase and Binance.US.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the settlement agreement, Bittrex neither admits nor denies the allegations. The terms also stipulate that Bittrex will have 90 days after its liquidation plan is effective to pay the SEC, and any delays may prompt the regulator to seek court judgment.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said the following in an official statement:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Today&rsquo;s settlement makes clear that you cannot escape liability by simply changing labels or altering descriptions, because what matters is the economic realities of those offerings [as such]."</p>

Context and Details of the Settlement
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The case against Bittrex is rooted in its alleged role as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearing agency in providing services to U.S. investors in connection with crypto assets. Part of the charges includes an accusation that Bittrex worked closely with token issuers to edit online statements to circumvent federal securities laws.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The settlement, subject to court approval, includes financial components: disgorgement of $14.4 million, prejudgment interest of $4 million, and a civil penalty of $5.6 million, culminating in a total monetary payment of $24 million.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, noted in his remarks that:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;[For years], Bittrex worked with token issuers to 'scrub' their online statements of any indicia that they were investment contracts&mdash;all in an effort to evade the federal securities laws. They failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The settlement underscores the broader regulatory landscape and the SEC's vigilant stance against non-compliance in the crypto industry. The outcome serves as a reminder to other crypto exchanges of the necessity to adhere to existing regulations, in a market that continues to draw significant attention from both investors and regulators.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Bittrex's settlement with the SEC, centering on unregistered operationbs as a broker, exchange, and clearing agency, brings further focus to the compliance measures (and, by extension, frameworks designed to adapt specifically for crypto) necessary in the space. The detailed legal agreements and financial components of the settlement highlight the regulatory challenges and ongoing efforts to bring clarity to the industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, fell victim to a sophisticated phishing scam after its social media account on X, previously known as Twitter, was hijacked.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The perpetrators posted a series of fraudulent messages on August 9, promising a giveaway of &ldquo;BCAP&rdquo; tokens. They provided a link to a fake website closely resembling Blockchain Capital's original site, intending to deceive users into linking their cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The fraudulent website had a minor alteration in its URL, adding an extra 'n', a detail easily missed by unsuspecting users. The scam strategy also involved a sense of urgency by stating the giveaway would only be available for a day, aiming to exploit the fear of missing out. Notably, to prevent potential exposure, the comments section was deactivated, inhibiting users from flagging the scam.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prompt action from informed members of the blockchain community led to the swift identification of the deceit. Blockchain Capital reestablished control over its account within hours, removing the misleading posts. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This cyber intrusion follows a broader pattern of scams in the crypto space, as highlighted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently. The agency issued a warning about the increasing instances of criminals posing as non-fungible token (NFT) developers. These fraudsters hack into high-profile social media accounts, falsely advertising new NFT releases. Victims are directed to counterfeit websites where, once their crypto wallets are linmked, funds are syphoned using malicious smart contracts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the FBI, stolen tokens are then laundered through multiple cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges, obfuscating their tracks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Blockchain Capital breach echoes a similar incident from April involving the crypto exchange platform, KuCoin. Its social media account was compromised, leading to a fake giveaway scam resulting in a loss of over $22.6K in cryptocurrency. In response, KuCoin assured full compensation to the impacted customers and emphasized the continued security of assets on its platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao, CEO of Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange, recently warned of the uptick in such phishing attacks and advised the community against using text message-based two-factor authentication.

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The controversy arises from Spark Protocol's terms of service, which actively prevent users from accessing the platform via virtual private networks (VPNs).

<p class="md-end-block md-p">This contention around user rights and access isn't isolated. Over the past year, DAI's market trajectory experienced turbulence. Its market cap plummeted by 43%, from $7B to $4B, after a destabilizing event in March when both DAI and USDC stablecoins momentarily dropped below their usual peg.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The French financial regulator announced amendments to its registration requirements for digital asset service providers as it prepares for MiCA&rsquo;s implementation. </p>
<p>France&rsquo;s Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) announced it would introduce &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; requirements for crypto firms as it prepared for the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.</p>
Amendments to Align with MiCA
<p>The AMF has amended its registration requirements for digital asset service providers (DASPs) to better align with the EU&rsquo;s upcoming regulatory framework. The regulator said its &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; requirements will take effect on January 1, 2024.</p>
<p>In its announcement, the AMF said the changes have two objectives:</p>

<p>&ldquo;to incorporate into the General Regulation and its policy the provisions applicable to DASPs subject to &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; registration. This regime will become mandatory from January 1, 2024, for new players wishing to provide the four services subject to mandatory registration;&rdquo;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&ldquo;align the requirements for DASPs licence with those for European authorisation for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under the MiCA Regulation, and allow a fast track procedure to be implemented towards CASP authorisation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>France already has a relatively comprehensive licensing regime for crypto firms and is implementing changes to its regulation to comply with MiCA which will take effect within the next 12 &ndash; 18 months.</p>
EU Signs MiCA Into Law
<p>The European Union announced in May that it formally signed MiCA into law. MiCA has been in the works for a long time and will introduce a comprehensive framework for licensing and regulating crypto businesses operating within the EU.</p>
<p>France has been one of the most welcoming countries for regulating the crypto sector. The governor of the Bank of France called for a stricter and more comprehensive licensing regime for crypto companies after 2022&rsquo;s market turmoil.</p>
<p>Recognising the need for heightened regulatory scrutiny, the French National Assembly voted on new measures for crypto regulation, including a new set of compliance frameworks for new crypto firms seeking registration in France.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a warning addressing investors against crypto platforms &ldquo;engaging in improper practices.&rdquo; </p>
<p>On Monday, Hong Kong regulators issued a warning to unlicensed crypto platforms &ldquo;engaging in improper practices.&rdquo; The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said some platforms are falsely claiming to have applied for registration. HashKey and OSL are the only two licensed exchanges in the city. &nbsp;</p>
SFC Takes a &ldquo;Dim View&rdquo; of Non-Compliance
<p>The SFC warned the unlicensed crypto platform advising investors to beware of these operations trading without the necessary registration. In a press release, the regulator said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has observed some unlicensed virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) engaging in improper practices. This statement warns VATPs of the potential legal and regulatory consequences of these improper practices and reminds investors to be wary of the risks of trading virtual assets on unregulated VATPs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator said it became aware of exchanges conducting business after falsely claiming to have applied to it for registration. The SFC noted such false claims aim to &ldquo;give the public a false sense of assurance&rdquo; with the goal of &ldquo;inducing another person to trade in virtual assets&rdquo; and are an offence under Hong Kong&rsquo;s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is doing everything possible to regulate the industry and introduce a new licensing regime for virtual asset service providers. On 1 June, the SFC introduced a new regulatory framework for platforms engaging in trading activities. Under the regulations, such providers can apply to the SFC for licenses to legitimise their operations. Hong Kong&rsquo;s approach to regulation aims to provide a structured environment for investors and traders. The Hashkey Exchange recently announced it obtained a license from the SFC, making it the first cryptocurrency platform allowed to offer services to retail users.</p>
<p>The SFC further warned the public that some unlicensed platforms continue to launch new products and services under existing entities that do not comply with its regulatory requirements. The Commission explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, they may, under new or existing entities, launch certain virtual assets for trading by retail clients, trading services in virtual asset derivatives, or arrangements involving virtual assets such as virtual asset &lsquo;deposits,&rsquo; &lsquo;savings&rsquo; or &lsquo;earnings&rsquo; which are not allowed under the new regime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator advised investors trading on unregulated exchanges that they could risk &ldquo;losing their entire investment&rdquo; held on that exchange should they discontinue their operations, collapse, or are hacked.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve of the U.S. issued new guidelines regarding the use of stablecoins and other digital assets by the national banks.</p>
Fed Tightens the Regulation of Stablecoins
<p>Just a day after PayPal had announced the launch of its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin PYUSD, the Federal Reserve of the U.S. published new guidelines clarifying the ways state member banks can interact with dollar-denominated digital currencies.</p>
<p>Basically, national banks are now required to seek permission of the Federal Reserve to engage in any sorts of activities related to the U.S. dollar-pegged digital assets, referred to as &ldquo;dollar tokens&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the statement, state member banks need to notify the Federal Reserve about the activities they mean to perform with the use of dollar tokens, whether it is issuing, holding, transacting, or even testing digital assets. The Federal Reserve might ask for additional information regarding the proposed activity. To proceed with the use of stablecoins in any way, the bank needs to receive a &ldquo;a written notification of supervisory nonobjection from the Federal Reserve&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A state member bank seeking to engage in such dollar token activities, including for the purpose of testing, must notify its lead supervisory point of contact at the Federal Reserve of the bank&rsquo;s intention to engage in the proposed activity and should include a description of the proposed activity. Federal Reserve supervisory staff may follow up with the bank to seek additional information in order to better understand the proposal and the control framework that the state member bank has put in place. After receiving a written notification of supervisory nonobjection, state member banks will continue to be subject to supervisory review and heightened monitoring of these activities,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

Mitigating Risks Related to the Use of &ldquo;Dollar Tokens&rdquo;
<p>To acquire the notification of nonobjection from the Federal Reserve, the bank needs to showcase an effective system of risk management and the ability to measure and control the risks of the proposed stablecoin activities on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve outlines five major types of risks linked to the use of dollar tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">operational risks: associated with the governance and the management of the network;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">cybersecurity risks: related to the stablecoin&rsquo;s network, smart contracts, and any use of open source code;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">liquidity risks, such as high redemptions of the token in a short period of time;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">illicit finance risks: customer identity verification, due diligence, monitoring suspicious activities, etc;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">consumer compliance risks: related to identifying and ensuring compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Federal Reserve has also reported that it would evaluate the banks&rsquo; comprehension of the relevant laws and their commitment to them.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>India has challenged its residents to develop an indigenous web browser with the feature of signing documents digitally through crypto tokens.</p>
Self-Reliant India
<p>In its press release of August 9, 2023, the Indian Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (MeitY) announced the launch of the Indian Web Browser Development Challenge (IWBDC).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The IWBDC is an Open Challenge Competition that seeks to inspire and empower technology enthusiasts, innovators, and developers from all corners of the country to create an indigenous web browser with its own trust store with an inbuilt CCA India root certificate, cutting edge functionalities and enhanced security &amp; data privacy protection features,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

<p>One of the key features that&rsquo;s expected to be supported by the browser is the digital signing of documents through a crypto token, with the aim to enhance the security of transactions and digital engagements.</p>
<p>The release of the India&rsquo;s native multifunctional web browser will mark a significant step towards &ldquo;Aatmanirbhar Bharat&rdquo; (translates to &ldquo;self-reliant India&rdquo;), Prime Minister Modi&rsquo;s plan to make the country more independent, technologically and economically .</p>

<p>&ldquo;Digital India has revolutionized how our nation functions, empowering citizens, boosting the economy and enhancing overall governance. As we move forward, embracing technology and promoting indigenous innovation will be pivotal in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, digitally empowered India,&rdquo; said Smt Sunita Verma, Scientist G &amp; GC (R&amp;D in Electronics &amp; IT).</p>

<p>The Indian Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), Shri Arvind Kumar, strives to ensure the security of digital certificates issued within the country and contributes to developing a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework that would enable secure electronic transactions throughout the nation.</p>
<p>However, India has been reliant on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates issued by foreign entities&rsquo; roots. Now, the challenge is to integrate India Root Certificate into the upcoming national browser, thus addressing the issue and making the country more &ldquo;Internet Resilient&rdquo;.</p>
Who Can Participate in the Challenge?
<p>All of the country&rsquo;s creative minds, including academia, industry, start-ups, or individuals, are encouraged to take part in the challenge and submit an idea for the innovative Indian web browser that could cater to a global audience.</p>
<p>The challenge will consist of three rounds: 18 participants will be selected in the first round, shortlisted to 8 in the second one, with only 3 coming to the final round. The winner will be granted 34 million Indian rupees (around $411,000) and will receive additional support in further development of the new browser.</p>

Now, the challenge is to integrate India Root Certificate into the upcoming national browser, thus addressing the issue and making the country more &ldquo;Internet Resilient&rdquo;.</p>
Who Can Participate in the Challenge?
<p>All of the country&rsquo;s creative minds, including academia, industry, start-ups, or individuals, are encouraged to take part in the challenge and submit an idea for the innovative Indian web browser that could cater to a global audience.</p>
<p>The challenge will consist of three rounds: 18 participants will be selected in the first round, shortlisted to 8 in the second one, with only 3 coming to the final round. The winner will be granted 34 million Indian rupees (around $411,000) and will receive additional support in further development of the new browser.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Austin, Texas, August 10th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Topl&rsquo;s CTO, Dr. Hans Behrens, was invited to present the peer-reviewed Ouroboros Taktikos research at China&rsquo;s prestigious conference in Haikou, China.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Topl, an interoperable blockchain protocol focused on a connected, inclusive, and sustainable global economy, today announces the peer-reviewed acceptance of its research on Ouroboros Taktikos. This consensus mechanism, built on the foundation of Cardano&rsquo;s Ouroboros Praos, shows a throughput increase of 2.9 times and a latency reduction of 5.7 times compared to Praos.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Topl's research indicates that by using a dynamic threshold, throughput and latency can be optimized, resulting in a more responsive network. Whereas Praos derives its name from the Greek term meaning "calm" or &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; and is known for its sparse consensus intervals, Taktikos, a Greek term meaning "arrangement," reflects a more dynamic approach to block ordering.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The Ouroboros Taktikos research was presented at the International Conference on Blockchain and Trustworthy Systems, known as BlockSys, in Haikou, China, and highlights potential areas of improvement within the Ouroboros consensus model. Topl has already integrated Taktikos into its chain to enhance the security and scalability of its protocol.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Unlike many advancements in the blockchain space, which are typically posted without any third-party validation, Topl's research underwent a rigorous academic peer-review process.

Its technical innovations, including interoperability and eUTxO efficiency, pave the way for economic system innovation by connecting builders across the Topl network.
