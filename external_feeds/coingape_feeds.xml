										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="675" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/16133609/Polkadot-Coin-e16503495656251.jpeg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Polkadot Tokens" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past eight months, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polkadot/">Polkadot coin price</a> has shown a series of lower high and lower low formations, indicating an established downtrend. A downsloping trendline showcased this evident downfall and acted as a key resistance that restricted bullish growth. However, with the new year recovery in the market, the coin price witnessed a V-shaped recovery from the $4.233 support. as a result, the DOT price rallied 60% since January and reached the current price of dollar 6.76.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $6.75 breakout will surge the DOT price 10% higher.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 20-and-100-day encourages buyers to reclaim the higher levels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Polkadot coin Inu coin is $1.09 Billion, indicating a 29.96% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/WJtVCHkt.png" alt="Polkadot Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing recovery in the coin market, the price provides a massive break out from the aforementioned trendline on January 14th. This breakout must have released market participants from a selling-on-rally sentiment to buy-on-dips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the Polkadot coin price prolongs its bullish recovery and currently challenges a local resistance of $6.75. if the daily candle manages to break above this horizontal resistance, the buyers will obtain another higher footing to continue to bull run.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-discord-groups-servers/">Top Crypto Discord Servers/Groups Worth Joining In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential breakout could carry the DOT price 10% higher to hit the $7.4 mark. However, as per the technical setup, each lower high performed during the downfall could be a potential target after the resistance breakout. Therefore, if the bull trend continues, the Polkadot coin will reach the $8, $9.76, or $11.8 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator.</span></h2>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the DOT price is constantly hitting the indicator&#8217;s upper band, suggesting the buying pressure is aggressive for the given time. Therefore, a minor consolidation or pullback could stabilize the prices for further growth.</span></p>
<p><b>RSI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Amid the rising price action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> reverted from the oversold region, indicating intensity buying is getting stabilized. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polkadot Coin Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $6.67</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $6.75 and $7.37</span></li>

This announcement comes following the exchange&#8217;s fundamental idea of acting as the bridge to Web3. Although the precise date of the listing has not been disclosed just yet, it is anticipated to be within the next few weeks.</p>
<h2>Coinbase To Add New Tokens</h2>
<p>The San Francisco-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> is expanding its portfolio of tradable assets by adding three more <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoins</a>. The new additions are ERC-20-based cryptocurrencies Audius (AUDIO), Threshold (T), and Axelar (AXL), which run on its proprietary <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/#:~:text=A%20blockchain%20is%20a%20distributed,functions%20to%20become%20a%20chain.">blockchain</a>. The three crypto assets <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="nofollow">witnessed</a> a slight increase in price following the announcement. AUDIO is now trading for $0.20, up by 6.30% over the past 24 hours. Threshold (T), which is currently changing hands for $0.03, rose by a whopping 34% over the same period. However, on the contrary, AXL is down by almost 9% at $0.58 after the announcement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136500" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/24012020/Screenshot-2023-01-24-012003.png" alt="" width="1006" height="510" /></p>
<p>Coinbase also announced that they would be delisting NuCypher (NU) and Keep (KEEP) from their exchange as both the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/">crypto tokens</a> were combined into the Threshold Network in a decentralized on-chain merger, which took place on January 1, 2022. The T token serves a dual purpose on the Threshold Network, where it is both a utility token and a management token for the Threshold DAO.</p>

<h2>Coinbase Listing Details</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> assets that an exchange like Coinbase adds to its roadmap are the ones that it intends to support on its platform in the not-too-distant future. However, until a formal listing is announced, transfers and trades of these assets are not yet supported. According to Coinbase, coins that were placed on the roadmap list may still be removed or may not get included at all owing to a number of different circumstances; nevertheless, some coins do finally get added to its catalog of supported crypto assets. The roadmap was developed with the intention of preventing insider trading and increasing the amount of openness surrounding Coinbase&#8217;s listing process.</p>
<p>On January 18th, KAVA, the cryptocurrency powering Kava&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/web-3-0/">Web3</a> network, made its debut on Coinbase&#8217;s trading platform following its addition to the roadmap only a few weeks ago.</p>

Moreover, using this level as a base support, the daily time frame chart shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a>. This bullish pattern signals the replenished buying pressure and provides an entry opportunity for interested traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price will remain in a sideways trend until the buyers don’t breach the $0.55 resistance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bullish crossover between the 20-and-100-day EMA encourages buyers for a $0.42 breakout</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.8 Billion, indicating a 155% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/7/7ftN9lPI.png" alt="XRP Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of this pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/">XRP price</a> has surged 35% from the $0.31 support and currently trades at the $0.42 mark. Moreover, the coin price is 5% up today and trying to breach the $0.43 neckline resistance of this mentioned pattern. A significant boost in volume indicates a higher possibility of $0.43. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a daily candle closing above the mentioned resistance will intensify the bullish momentum for further rally. The post-breakout rally will drive the XRP price 30% higher to hit the next crucial resistance of 0.55.</span></p>
<p>Also Read:<a href="https://coingape.com/top-7-crypto-marketing-firms-of-the-year/"> Top Crypto Marketing Firms / Agencies 2023; Here’s Best Picks</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it seems the XRP price has been in a sideways market for the last eight months. This range movement is spread from $0.55 resistance to 0.312 support, and for the coin price to maintain sustained recovery, the buyers need to surpass the $0.5 barrier.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD</strong>: The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line rising gradually higher into the bullish territory indicate sustained buying in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the fallfish EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) accentuate an overall sideways trend in the XRP price. Moreover, the 200-day EMA wavering near the $0.42 mark increases the resistance power of this level.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.422</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.42 and $0.55</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.313 and 0.226</span></li>

In the past three years, many crypto investors especially from Southeast Asia have shown their support for this dog-themed cryptocurrency. From Shibarium to Elon Musk’s support, there are multiple reasons why Shiba Inu will witness a massive price rally in 2023.</p>
<p>Here are the 5 main reasons why it is expected that Shiba Inu will rule the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">crypto market</a> in 2023:</p>
<h4>Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s Recent Price Rally</h4>
<p>The last few days have been eventful for this meme coin. Currently trading at $0.00001212 with a 24-hour trading volume of $391,109,797, Shiba Inu started its new year with a price value of $0.0000086. If the coin continued to keep the pace constant, it might reach the new ATH this year.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136411" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136411" style="width: 1162px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136411" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/23131436/SHIB1.png" alt="" width="1162" height="628" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136411" class="wp-caption-text">Source &#8211; CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<h4>Shibarium &#8211; Low gas fees for future success</h4>
<p>SHIB is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, its gas fees have been much higher than anyone would like. Shibarium is a blockchain/layer-2 solution that will usher in lower transaction fees.</p>
<h4>Shytoshi&#8217;s faith in Shibarium</h4>
<p>Shytoshi held a Q&amp;A session on Telegram with investors. While answering one of the questions <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusama" rel="nofollow">Shytoshi Kusama</a> said, people will not celebrate when the Shibarium Beta launches. Instead, they will consider building projects to enhance the network. Shytoshi added that instead of celebrating, users will connect, build, and work together to strengthen the L2 platform.</p>
<h4>Valuable meme crypto brand</h4>
<p>To stand out in the ocean of altcoins, stablecoins, meme tokens, and newly launched cryptos, effective branding is key. Shiba Inu has been trending on social media, and its brand has been spreading like wildfire.</p>
<h4>Elon Musk-driven</h4>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> has a thing for meme coins and his tweets are the proof. SHIB is fortunately on Elon Musk&#8217;s positive tweets. He once tweeted about getting a Shiba Inu dog, and the price of SHIB rose to 300%.</p>

This comes after Gemini&#8217;s customers were affected by the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-lender-genesis-filed-for-bankruptcy-amid-troubles/">bankruptcy of Genesis Capital</a> due to the collapse of the FTX empire, back in December of 2022.</p>
<h2>Gemini Cuts 10% Workforce</h2>
<p>At this point, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> has implemented at least three rounds of layoff in the last eight months. On Monday, Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss sent a message on Slack informing staff members, who are referred to internally as &#8220;Astronauts,&#8221; of the most recent round of layoffs.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cameron-winklevoss/">Cameron Winklevoss</a> was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was our hope to avoid further reductions after this summer, however, persistent negative macroeconomic conditions and unprecedented fraud perpetuated by bad actors in our industry have left us with no other choice but to revise our outlook and further reduce headcount.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gemini and Genesis teamed together in February 2021 to offer Gemini Earn, a high-yielding cryptocurrency lending product, as evidence of the exchange&#8217;s tight ties to the ailing Genesis. It wasn&#8217;t until the beginning of this month that the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against the companies, alleging that they had sold unregistered securities to market participants through the platform Gemini Earn.</p>
<h2>Growing Industry Layoffs</h2>
<p>According to reports, customers of the Earn program were recognized in <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bankruptcy/">bankruptcy</a> documents as Genesis&#8217; top unsecured creditor with claims totaling over $765 million. On January 20th, Genesis submitted their petition for protection under Chapter 11.</p>
<p>During the past several weeks, a number of prominent <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> companies, such as Coinbase, Crypto.com, Blockchain.com, and ConsenSys, have reduced their workforces in response to the current crypto winter. Gemini had earlier let off more employees in July, after having previously cut 10% of its workforce in June. As per recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/gemini-is-laying-off-10-of-staff-marking-latest-blow-for-winklevoss-crypto-startup" rel="nofollow">information</a>, the headcount of Gemini dropped from 1,100 at the beginning of 2022 to somewhere between 650 and 700 persons by the end of 2022.</p>

The price recovery not only led to capital infusion to the market, it also helps new investors to join the market. Also, the crypto price rally could not have come at a better time for some cryptocurrencies that are about to make technical progress. The much awaited Litecoin (LTC) halving event is scheduled for August 3, 2023.</p>

<p>The halving event will mean that the volume of newly minted LTC will be reduced by half. It is going to be the third such halving event for the cryptocurrency. In this context, the Litecoin trader community is already abuzz with activity in anticipation of the halving event. Meanwhile, Litecoin price prediction is on for the cryptocurrency to breach the $100 figure.</p>
<h2>Litecoin Rally Ahead?</h2>
<p>In the lead up to the halving event in August, the 14th ranked cryptocurrency could at stage witness a price rally. In this context, investors are expecting a rally until above the $100 mark in short term. As of writing, the LTC price stands at $89.64, up by around 1% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/litecoin/">CoinGape price tracker</a>. According to crypto investor <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoJelleNL/status/1617495228482727937?s=20&amp;t=ZS3krVQKsPhyRbJFsDOpdQ" rel="nofollow">Jelle</a> on Twitter,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With its next halving estimated to take place later this year, we could finally see the catalyst for new $LTC all time highs. For now, chart looks good for a run to 1.618, slightly above $100. Above that area, we go to the races.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>However, it remains to be seen when a full fledged LTC price rally is set to take place in anticipation of the August event. Also, the halving event is subject to changes in timeline due to technical changes.</p>

<h2>New Crypto Guidelines</h2>
<p>The advisory is the most recent in a string of crypto-related directives that the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has published over the course of the past year. Back in 2022, the world witnessed a market crash that reduced the value of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/">crypto tokens</a> by around $1.3 trillion in 2022. The breakdown caused the failure of cryptocurrency companies such as FTX and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/celsius-2/">Celsius Network</a>, the most recent of which was <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis/">Genesis Global Capital</a>, the lending section of which filed for protection under the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bankruptcy/">bankruptcy</a> laws of the United States on Thursday.</p>
<p>Additionally, state-regulated businesses must tell customers how they account for their customers&#8217; digital money, according to the NYDFS, one of the few state agencies with such a regulatory structure in place. It comes at a time when federal regulators including the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cftc/">CFTC</a>) are raising concerns about the absence of consumer protections in the cryptocurrency industry. There are several restrictions placed on the actions that federal agencies such as the CFTC can take since Congress has not passed legislation that grants them extra jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Crypto At Crossroads Of Regulation</h2>
<p>The state of New York mandates that businesses go through audits to determine whether or not they are in compliance with state regulations on KYC policies, anti-money laundering safeguards, and capital requirements. Examinations of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> businesses are uncommon in the majority of other states.</p>
<p>Adrienne Harris, the superintendent of NYDFS, was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s timely, but truth be told, it was something we had on our policy roadmap even before FTX</p></blockquote>
<p>Harris, a former senior counselor at the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/the-u-s-treasury-department/">U.S. Treasury Department</a> who was confirmed as superintendent last year, has spent most of her first year in the position enhancing her agency&#8217;s attention on cryptocurrency. According to her, the NYDFS virtual currency arm has close to 50 people and is currently looking to expand.</p>

The coin price has gained 230% since January 1st and currently trades at the $0.052 mark. However, over a week, the Gala price has been moving sideways, displaying a power struggle to surpass the monthly resistance of $0.0577. This resistance has forced a consolidation phase, and here&#8217;s how it may influence the coin&#8217;s near future price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $0.07 could set the GALA coin price for a 20% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below $0.044 could prolong a bearish correction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the GALA is $645 Million indicating a 106% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/Y5EwwNHQ.png" alt="GALA Coin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GALA coin price showed several higher price rejection candles at $0.057 resistance indicating the sellers continue to defend this level. Anyhow this consolidation phase is important for Gala coin to neutralize the excessive buying from the market and check sustainability above the newly reclaimed higher levels. Moreover, the coin price has tested the $0.0577 resistance and $0.044 support sufficiently to validate it as a narrow-range formation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the volume activity decreasing during this range indicates a temporary consolidation in Gala price. Therefore, if the recovery sentiment persists and the crypto market, the coin price is likely to break the overhead ceiling of $0.0577.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above the aforementioned resistance will signal the recuperated bullish momentum to lead to further price rallies. The post-breakout rally could drive the 21% higher to hit the $0.07 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator </span></h2>
<p><b>RSI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Amid the sideways price action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> reverted from the oversold region, indicating excessive buying is getting neutralized. However, the indicator slope should not breach the midline(50%) to maintain a bullish sentiment in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the GALA price is gradually closing to the indicator’s midline, reflecting the bullish trend is stabilizing, and buyers could prepare for the next jump.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">GALA CoinIntraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.052</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.0577 and $0.07</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.044 and 0.033</span></li>

There are all kinds of reasons why you might want to invest in Shiba Inu and we present you with the top 5 among them.</p>
<h4>Shibarium Could be a Big Boost</h4>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/shibainucoin" rel="nofollow">Shiba Inu</a> already is blessed with a good ecosystem. The Shibarium is just the cherry on top. According to the creator of this meme coin, Shibarium is going to add even more advantages to the ecosystem. It is a layer 2 solution that will extend the features of SHIB.</p>
<h4>Does have a potential</h4>
<p>At present, there are over 20,000 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> in circulation and at least 50-100 tokens are getting launched every day. However, not all of them can be considered good investment options. Walking in the same way as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu was successful to surpass the first meme coin in the industry. History can repeat itself in the future.</p>
<h4>Shiba Inu is an ERC-20 token</h4>
<p>Many people still wonder why investors choose Shiba Inu over Dogecoin, which indeed was a trendsetter in the first place. One of the key differentiators between the two is SHIB&#8217;s status as an <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> token.</p>
<h4>Acts as Penny Token</h4>
<p>When cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are priced at US$22k and US$1.6k respectively, buying a single token might be a big task for a commoner. On the other hand, SHIB is under $1 with many promising future price surge possibilities.</p>
<h4>Metaverse plays a Crucial Role</h4>
<p>Because of the Metaverse platform, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">SHIB price</a> is expected to create a new high in 2023. Currently, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001212 with a 24-hour trading volume of $390,155,033. If we take on the words of many SHIB enthusiasts then this meme coin does have tremendous potential when it combines effective market strategies with positive market sentiment.</p>

The BTC price hit a high of $23,282 last week, marking a 5-month high despite the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> contagion that continues to impact the market sentiment.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price currently trades at $22,888, trading sideways in the last two days. The 24-hour low and high for Bitcoin are $22,387 and $23,056, respectively. While analysts expect Bitcoin price to hit $25k this month, the rally may not happen.</p>
<h2>5 Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) Price Hitting $25K Is Unlikely</h2>
<p>Here are the reasons why the Bitcoin rally is likely over and the BTC price may not hit $25k this month.</p>
<h3>1. European Central Bank Monetary Tightening</h3>
<p>The European Central Bank plans to deliver 50 bps interest rate hikes in the next two meetings in February and March. ECB President Christine Lagarde asserts the need for further tightening and revising rate hike targets to bring down inflation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Parliament&#8217;s Economic Affairs Committee votes on a draft law seeking banks offering crypto services to hold more capital to manage risks from crypto assets.</p>
<h3>2. US Federal Reserve FOMC Meeting</h3>
<p>The U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> to announce a rate hike in the next FOMC meeting on February 1. While the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPI</a> and jobs data signal a smaller rate hike, economists expect another 50 bps rate hike. Invests may have to wait a little longer for the Fed pivot.</p>
<p>As per <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CME FedWatch Tool</a>, the probability of a 25 bps rate hike is 97.2%. The reading has decreased from the last day as investors await the fourth-quarter GDP data due on Thursday.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price stabilizes below $23k ahead of the ECB and U.S. Fed rate hike decision. Thus, traders are unlikely to take any decision before these events.</p>
<h3>3. US Dollar Index Volatility</h3>
<p>The U.S. dollar index (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DXY</a>) will continue to show volatility ahead of the importance week. The DXY currently moves near below 102 and is likely to jump higher ahead of the rate hike decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>A rise in DXY will make the Bitcoin price to dive lower and bring a correction in the broader crypto market. Moreover, the recent policy decision by Japan and European Union have weakened the US dollar and the Fed will most likely thwart it.</p>
<h3>4. The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index Plunges</h3>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-crypto-fear-and-greed-index-how-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index</a> is neutral at 50. The index has dropped in the last few days as traders anticipate a decline in Bitcoin price due to possibilities of profit-taking and &#8220;sell the news&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>While the BTC price is in an early <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bull market</a>, traders are unlikely to trade in the current market conditions.</p>
<h3>5. Bitcoin Technical Indicators Signal Strong Resistance</h3>
<p>Bitcoin price is trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA). Analysts expect a move to 200-WMA, which is near $25k.</p>
<p>In the daily timeframe, Bollinger Bands breakout to subdue in the coming days and Bitcoin price can fall below $21,500. Moreover, the RSI is moving in the overbought zone and is likely to fall lower. Other indicators also signal a decline in Bitcoin price.</p>

This gradual movement appears to be laying the stage for a slight pullback, but depending on the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin">price of Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and how it behaves, things might very well alter dramatically.</p>
<h2>Ether Shows Confidence</h2>
<p>According to the most recent data obtained, the total value of all <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> has increased by 0.31%, reaching $1.05 trillion. And, at the time of writing, the overall trading activity has also witnessed an increase of 6.96% to $53.53 billion. The price of Ethereum, on the other hand, recently breached the macro downward trendline. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Bitcoinsensus/status/1617509475816017927" rel="nofollow">consensus</a> among market watchers is that a significant amount of buying confidence might be generated for a new uptrend in Ethereum (ETH) prices if the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> king is successful in overcoming the lower high of $1,700.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136482 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/23191655/FnKL9OAagAA2get.jpeg" alt="Ethereum (ETH) price" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>However, in the world of cryptocurrencies, fundamental analysis also plays a vital role apart from the technical aspects. With the total <a href="https://coingape.com/eth-staking-jumps-ath-ahead-of-shanghai-upgrade-has-ethereum-priced-in/">ETH staked on the Beacon Chain reaching over 16 million</a> ahead of the Shanghai upgrade; which is almost 13.4% of the total <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/circulating-supply/">circulating supply</a>, Ethereum price may set off another run-up. A move along these lines will not change the bearish divergence, but it will enable market makers to collect the buy-stop liquidity that is currently lying above $1,679 and catch the early bears in their trap. And while this chase for liquidity is going on, the price of Ethereum might reach as high as $2,000.</p>

<h2>Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge</h2>
<p>Additionally, as pointed out by macro and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> expert tedtalksmacro, the USD stablecoin has significantly increased in the past 24 hours. Recording almost a $320 million growth in supply, it acts as a potential indicator of higher buying demand by retailers and whales in the crypto market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">USD stablecoin uptick in the past ~24hrs</p>
<p>Approximately $320M increase in supply, steady lads. <a href="https://t.co/YVbMLIi2vy">pic.twitter.com/YVbMLIi2vy</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On the other hand, the price threshold of $2,000 isn&#8217;t the only thing holding <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> back from continuing its ascent. A bullish perspective for the short term, even if it is running on fumes, is warranted if the price of Ethereum does decide to go higher. If Bitcoin bulls can make a strong return, this perspective will shift significantly. In such a scenario, there is a chance that ETH will keep climbing higher and possibly breach the coveted $3,000 mark. As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,634. This represents a decrease of 0.44% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 5.24% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape’s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="861" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/04041006/There-is-absolutely-no-doubts-about-the-growing-popularity-of-Axie-Infinity-especially-with-regards-to-its-play-to-earn-feature.png" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="AXS" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the new year recovery in the crypto market, the Axie Infinity coin gave a bullish breakout from the long coming <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>. This breakout must have shifted the market sentiment from selling on the rallies to buying on dips. In addition, the post-retest rally has surged the coin 61.6% higher in the last five, currently trading at $12.4. However, the technical setup for the pattern has prepared more gains for the AXS price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $12 breakout sets Axie infinity coin for a 25% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 20-and-100-day EMA&#8217;s on the verge of bullish crossover offers additional confirmation on prolonged recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Axie Infinity coin is $514 Million, indicating a 1242% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/Wp6Q64BN.png" alt="Axie Infinity Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/axie-infinity/">Axie Infinity coin price</a> witnessed a steady downtrend for the past seven months under the influence of a falling wedge pattern. However, in theory, this pattern provides a remarkable bull run upon the breakout of its resistance trendline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with the recent recovery in the crypto market, the coin buyers breach downsloping resistance on January 12th. This breakout triggered an exceptional rally in the last five days and pushed the coin to its current price of $12.4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ongoing recovery, the coin price reached another horizontal level of $12. This new breakout offers buyers a higher footing to extend the bullish rally further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, by press time, the AXS coin shows a 2% intraday drop, along with high wick rejection attached to the daily candle. This rejection candle indicates profit booking from temporary buyers, which could plunge the prices back to the $12 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retest to the newly obtained support will validate if buyers hold at higher levels or not. if the retest phase shows sustainability about the breached resistance, the interested traders could find an entry opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, as per technical setup, each swing high during the pattern formation could act as a potential target upon breakout. Therefore the upcoming target for the Axie infinity coin could be $20 and $27.25.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> wavering in the overbought territory suggests a consolation or pullback is needed before the recovery rally resumes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the 200-day EMA at $14 is trying to undermine the bullish recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axie Infinity Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $12.48</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $15.6 and $20</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $12 and $10</span></li>

In this pursuit to provide clarity around the crypto market, the European Parliament&#8217;s economic affairs committee will hold a vote on Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Will Basel III measures be implemented?</h2>
<p>As per<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-lawmakers-vote-tighter-crypto-esg-rules-banks-2023-01-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports,</a> the<a href="https://coingape.com/european-union-postpones-its-final-vote-on-mica-regulation-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> European Union is due to vote</a> on cross party compromises. It is a draft law that will help the authorities to implement the remaining elements of Basel III. <em>(Basel III is a set of measures that are internationally agreed upon by leaders. The Basel Committee developed these measures in response to the financial crisis of 2007-09).</em></p>
<p>This suggests that the banks would have to keep apart punitive amounts of capital used to cover holdings of digital asset. One of the amendments of the drafted law states that financial institutions would have to apply a risk weighting of 1,250% of capital to crypto exposures. This move will help them to cover a loss ahead.<a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <strong>Read More Crypto News Here&#8230;..</strong></a></p>
<p>Basel Committee of banking regulators dropped recommendations for the global financial institution back in December. However, If the EU goes in favor of the draft law, then the amendments will also introduce a glimpse of Shadow Banking.</p>

The first nuclear-powered data center in the United States, which will house Bitcoin mining operations, has just been finished being built.</p>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/First-nuclear-powered-data-centre-at-Susquehanna-c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a report</a>, Cumulus Data, a zero-carbon data center manufacturer and a subsidiary of independent power producer Talen Energy, has finished the powered shell for its first data center powered by a 2.5-gigawatt nuclear power plant.</p>
<h2>Setting up nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining</h2>
<p>The Susquehanna nuclear power plant in northeast Pennsylvania is immediately connected to the 48MW, 300,000-square-foot data center. Its 1,200-acre site is planned to house the first cloud computing and Bitcoin mining operations in the United States.</p>
<p>With a total projected capacity for the campus of 475 megawatts, two more are in advanced development in phase 1 of the project. Additional 18 Talen Energy locations that might potentially house data centers with direct access to the power plant were also found by Cumulus Data.</p>

<h2>Eco-friendly Bitcoin mining setup</h2>
<p>TeraWulf recently stated that it was in the early stages of scaling up its mining operations, for which it plans to offer 50MW, despite the fact that work on the construction of the Bitcoin mining was temporarily paused in early December 2022. When Talen Energy and the American crypto mining company, TeraWulf agreed to a joint venture, the creation of the Nautilus Cryptomine, a zero-carbon Bitcoin mining facility, was revealed.</p>
<p>The Virunga National Park in eastern Congo is using hydroelectricity to mine bitcoin in another low-cost effort to raise money to protect the forests and wildlife in Africa&#8217;s oldest protected park, which have been harmed by years of militia violence, deforestation, and inadequate government support.</p>

According to crypto experts, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have massive potential to post a bullish explosion. Two years ago, Shiba Inu left its biggest competitor behind in terms of market capitalization. Resulting in a massive price surge and popularity among investors.</p>
<p>But now, with bear market conditions set to continue well into 2023, why is it expected that meme coins will leave behind major <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and Solana?</p>
<h2>Why do Investors prefer Meme Coins?</h2>
<p>You must be aware of the fact that these coins are not designed to be used in the same way as a utility token but rather to be traded. Most of these coins have an unlimited supply and as a result, investors can gain significant profits if these tokens spike in price.</p>
<h4>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h4>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/shiba-inu-shib/">Shiba Inu</a> slowly but surely is moving toward a bullish trend. It has increased by 0.5% in the past 24 hours of this writing, and around 16% in the last 7 days. There is a huge potential for the coin to do well in the future as well.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136427" style="width: 1167px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136427" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/23143236/Shiba-Inu-7-days.png" alt="" width="1167" height="636" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136427" class="wp-caption-text">Source &#8211; CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the most popular meme coins has a circulating supply of around 500 trillion with a total supply of 1 quadrillion. The fast-growing adoption of the Shiba Inu Eternity Game and Shibarium launch are among the biggest drivers of the current SHIB growth.</p>
<h4>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h4>
<p>Many experts speculate that Dogecoin could truly take off in 2023. Making it an attractive DeFi-enabling investment option. It would take a brave soul to bet against <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/dogecoin" rel="nofollow">Dogecoin</a> taking off as it is expected the adoption of this meme coin will increase, and it might do well in the coming bull run.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136428" style="width: 1167px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136428" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/23143320/Dogecoin-7-days.png" alt="" width="1167" height="648" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136428" class="wp-caption-text">Source &#8211; CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.089108 with a 24-hour trading volume of $933,033,366. In the past seven days, the coin has risen 5.63%, and if everything went according to the predictions, the bulls will then again try to drive the price above $0.1.</p>

The wallet is seen as the banks introducing a wallet that could rival <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/apple/">Apple Pay</a> and PayPal. Although a definite timeline is yet to be finalized, reports suggest that the product could be released towards the end of 2023. Although there is no mention of enabling crypto payments through the wallet, drawing a comparison to Apple Pay does not rule away the possibility.</p>

<h2>Big Banks Collaborate</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-plan-payment-wallet-to-compete-with-paypal-apple-pay-11674433472?mod=e2tw" rel="nofollow">Wall Street Journal report</a>, the big banks are working together to allow their customers pay using the wallet which in turn is linked to the debit and credit cards. Thanks to the huge network of users between the banks, the wallet could potentially attract a massive usage. Between these banks, there is a massive network of about 150 million debit and credit cards that could integrate with the wallet once it is live.</p>
<p>In a recent development, <a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/jp-morgan-to-launch-its-crypto-wallet/">JP Morgan registered for its crypto wallet trademark</a> with the title &#8216;JP Morgan Wallet&#8217;. Reports suggested that the bank would offer services like crypto payments processing and virtual checking account. However, it is yet to be confirmed if the other banks are party to this project.</p>

The much wanted price rally is proving to be a life saver for a huge proportion of small and retail traders.

<p>Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which shares an inverse relation with the Bitcoin price, is mirroring the larger market perspective in the macroeconomic scenario. In the last one month, the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy">dollar index</a> dropped in value by 2.25%.</p>

<p>Trading close to the $23,000 milestone, the BTC price is currently at its highest since mid of August 2022. In the context of a record breaking crypto bull run in 2021, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/terra-luna/">Terra network</a> collapse marked the onset of a gradual price collapse for all cryptocurrencies. However, the crypto traders appear to have priced in the adversities of 2022 before starting the current year afresh. Living up to the reputation of being strange in many ways, the current market cycle has also withered away traditional setback occasions like the Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Chinese New Year 2023, the BTC price rose by around 2%, taking the price to a six month high. Traditionally, the Chinese festival had on most times meant a <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> price drop. Thanks to the sideways movement BTC followed over the weekend, the top cryptocurrency is currently priced at 22,820, up by around 0.50% in the last 24 hours.</p>
