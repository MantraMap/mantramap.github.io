			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The world of cryptocurrencies is a dynamic landscape, characterized by constant price fluctuations and market movements. Recent events have seen Bitcoin Cash (BCH) experience a significant 25% decline, leaving investors to ponder their next moves.</p>
<p>As the crypto market responds to these shifts, savvy investors are exploring alternative options that offer greater potential for profits.</p>
<p>One such option that has been garnering attention is Borroe ($ROE), a project with an innovative fundraising ecosystem and a growing buzz in the crypto community. Let&rsquo;s delve into the potential advantages of considering $ROE for investment amid Bitcoin Cash's downturn.</p>
Innovative Fundraising Ecosystem: Borroe's Transformative Approach
<p>Borroe's AI-powered funding marketplace revolutionizes the fundraising landscape, empowering content creators and participants in the Web3 space to generate instant cash flow by selling future recurring revenue NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This cutting-edge approach aligns perfectly with the evolving nature of fundraising in the crypto space, positioning Borroe as a transformative force in the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, Borroe's commitment to creating a decentralized and peer-to-peer ecosystem resonates with the crypto community's desire for inclusivity and user empowerment. By fostering a community-driven platform, Borroe paves the way for a new era of fundraising and investment.</p>
AI-Powered Risk Assessment: A Pillar of Trust
<p>Security is a paramount concern in the crypto world, and Borroe addresses this with its integration of AI-powered risk assessment. By leveraging advanced technology, the project ensures a secure and efficient fundraising process, instilling confidence and trust among investors. This emphasis on safety and reliability makes $ROE an attractive option for those seeking dependable investment opportunities.</p>
Liquidity-Driven Solutions: Empowering Investors and Content Creators
<p>Borroe places significant emphasis on liquidity-driven solutions, offering seamless trading and liquidity options for future recurring revenue NFTs. This dynamic feature not only benefits investors by providing flexibility but also empowers content creators with a platform to access liquidity, enhancing the overall appeal of $ROE as an investment prospect.</p>
The Buzz around Borroe: A Massive Turnout for the Presale
<p>Amidst the crypto market's ever-changing landscape, Borroe has generated a massive buzz in recent weeks. Its Beta presale witnessed an overwhelming response from investors, with $250,000 worth of $ROE tokens sold in just five days.</p>
<p>Early success has reinforced the project's popularity and potential, making it a top contender in the crypto investment space. With more than 28 million $ROE tokens sold the presale funding generated will be dedicated towards building its ecosystem and providing utility to $ROE holders.</p>
<p>To ensure inclusivity, Borroe Finance has lowered the barrier of entry to the presale to enable anyone to take part in the event. In addition, there are multiple payment means to accommodate established crypto communities like BTC, ETH and BNB.</p>
<p>Buy $ROE Presale </p>
Strategizing Amid Market Fluctuations
<p>Bitcoin Cash's recent decline has sparked discussions among investors about the best course of action. In times of market volatility, strategic decision-making is crucial for maximizing returns and managing risks.</p>
<p>While some investors may opt to sell their BCH holdings, others are exploring alternative investment avenues, such as Borroe ($ROE), with its innovative fundraising ecosystem and positive market reception.</p>
<p>As the crypto market continues to evolve, prudent investors will consider diversification strategies and explore projects that align with their long-term goals. Diligent research, risk assessment, and seeking professional advice are vital components of successful investment journeys in the crypto space.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Getting into a cryptocurrency before it explodes in value is essential for many market analysts and investors. By doing so, they can achieve the highest ROI. According to the on-chart data, three of the best altcoins that can explode in value during the current market include Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), and Tradecurve (TCRV).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Summary
● Litecoin to reach $177.22 by the end of the year
● The Stellar crypto to spike to $0.019
● Tradecurve on a bullish momentum and can spike by 100x
Litecoin (LTC) Future Value After Halving Event
<p class="s5">The Litecoin (LTC) cryptocurrency traded at $86.85 on August 3. 2023. Its halving event was completed on August 2, 2023, and since then, the cryptocurrency has been viewed as a solid opportunity for investors.</p>
<p class="s5">Getting into the project before the explosion in value due to the bigger scarcity can lead to better ROI. For example, in the past week, the Litecoin price saw its low point at $85.84, with its high point at $95.21. In the past year, the LTC crypto increased by 46.1%. </p>
<p class="s5">Litecoin now has a market cap of $6,381,509,379, and in the past 24 hours, its trading volume saw a decrease of 4.84% and is now at $741,291,650. According to a Litecoin price prediction, it can reach $117.22 by the end of the year following its halving event.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Stellar (XLM) Expected to Surge
<p class="s5">There&rsquo;s also the Stellar (XLM) crypto that trades at $0.042 as of August 3, 2023. The cryptocurrency has a market cap of $3,881,163,608 and a 24-hour trading volume of $144,774,383. </p>
<p class="s5">In the past seven days, the Stellar price saw its low point at $0.139863, with its high point at $0.166501. In addition, during the past month, the Stellar crypto has been up in value by 34.9%. At this rate of growth, according to the current Stellar price prediction, it can reach a value of $0.19 by the end of the year.</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Still In Early Stages of Its Presale and Can Spike By 100x Rivaling Litecoin and Stellar
<p class="s5">Tradecurve (TCRV) is an innovative hybrid exchange that can completely change how people interact with DeFi by enabling borderless access not only to crypto but to derivatives trading as well.</p>
<p class="s5">On top of the exchange, anyone will be able to begin trading by creating an account, connecting their crypto wallet, and then using the deposited crypto as collateral. This also completely removes any requirement for FIAT currencies or KYC procedures.</p>
<p class="s5">In addition to all of that, there are advanced features like AI-driven trading bots and Copy Trader that work through a subscription model.</p>
<p class="s5">Traders can also enjoy high leverage starting at 500:1, protection against negative balances, a VIP account system, and a dedicated trading academy.</p>
<p class="s5">During the Stage 5 presale, TCRV trades at just $0.025. So far, the cryptocurrency has climbed in value by 150% since its starting price. Analysts are bullish on its future and predict an additional climb of 100x at launch. The team will also implement Proof of Reserves (PoR) and a dedicated Trading App for iOS and Android.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an unprecedented move in the crypto world, the team behind the new memecoin $SHIT is taking their token to the next level. On the eve of their Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on Blooprint, they announced two groundbreaking initiatives: the construction of an actual sewer system and the establishment of a real-world SHIT University.</p>
<p>The sewer, a first in the crypto world, is not just a metaphorical nod to the token's name. The $SHIT team is literally investing in infrastructure, planning to build a state-of-the-art sewer system. This initiative, while unconventional, symbolizes $SHIT's commitment to utility and practical value in the crypto space. The team believes that every great project starts from the ground up, and in this case, even further below.</p>
<p>In addition to the literal sewer, $SHIT is also proud to announce the establishment of SHIT University. Unlike typical crypto education platforms, SHIT University will be a physical institution, complete with lecture halls, dormitories, and a dedicated faculty. The university aims to offer a curriculum that covers everything from the basics of blockchain technology to the philosophy of memecoins. The goal is to create a new generation of crypto enthusiasts who can appreciate the beauty of $SHIT and other memecoins.</p>
<p>These initiatives are set to launch in conjunction with the IDO of $SHIT on Blooprint. The IDO, scheduled to start on 31 July 2023, is a highly anticipated event in the crypto space. With a total supply of 420,690,000,000,001 tokens, $SHIT promises to offer a unique, straightforward, and fun investment opportunity.</p>
<p>The interest in $SHIT from leading venture capital firms such as a16z, Shima Capital, and Coinbase Ventures has already put this memecoin in the spotlight. With the announcement of the literal sewer and SHIT University, $SHIT is set to further disrupt the memecoin market and establish itself as a leader in community engagement and education.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Laura Swain, the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Of New York, has dismissed a class action lawsuit against USDT issuer Tether and its sister company Bitfinex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit was brought on by plaintiffs who alleged Tether was falsely advertising its USDT stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
A Big Win For Tether And Bitfinex&nbsp;
<p>The ruling is being seen as a significant win for the two entities and was announced in a blog post published on Tether&rsquo;s official website. The post stated that the Chief Judge delivered a comprehensive and incisive 6-page decision, including an order to dismiss the class action lawsuit against the two entities, adding that it lacked merit. The post stated,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, Chief Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Of New York issued a comprehensive and incisive 6-page decision that included an order dismissing the meritless class action lawsuit filed by Matthew Anderson and Shawn Dolifka against Tether and Bitfinex companies in its entirety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawsuit was brought on by plaintiffs Shawn Dolifka and Matthew Anderson. The plaintiffs claimed that Tether had falsely advertised its USDT stablecoin being backed in a 1:1 ratio by the U.S. dollar. However, the court did not buy their argument. Tether added that the fact that the entirety of the lawsuit was dismissed at such an early stage showed that the allegation against it and Bitfinex were devoid of any merit.&nbsp;</p>
Tether And Bitfinex CTO Reacts&nbsp;
<p>The verdict sparked a wave of reactions from the crypto ecosystem. Paolo Ardoino, Tether, and Bitfinex CTO took to X (formerly Twitter) and expressed his satisfaction with the ruling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tether and Bitfinex Win Comprehensive Legal Victory as U.S. District Court Dismisses Class Action Lawsuit The Court correctly held that the plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint lacked any &ldquo;plausible allegations of injury&rdquo; because it includes no facts showing that &ldquo;USDT had a diminished actual value at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prominent Bitcoin lawyer Stuart Hoegner applauded the Tether team&rsquo;s efforts and broke down the court ruling in a long thread on X.&nbsp;</p>
The Court Ruling&nbsp;
<p>The court gave several reasons for throwing out the lawsuit. It stated that the plaintiffs had not provided sufficient facts in the case nor mentioned the buying or selling price of USDT for the plaintiffs. The court further added that market data showed that USDT still maintains its peg with the USD at $1, and even if there were misrepresentations from the defendant&rsquo;s side, there was no evidence that showed USDT had lost its value.&nbsp;</p>
The Complaint In Question&nbsp;
<p>The case stems from a complaint filed in 2021 when the plaintiffs, Shawn Dolifika and Matthew Anderson, claimed that Tether&rsquo;s statement that its USDT was backed by the U.S. dollar in a 1:1 peg was false. According to the complaint, Tether and Bitfinex did not maintain adequate reserves for the USDT in circulation. Furthermore, the complaint also alleged that the reserves did not contain USD as advertised but were a mix of assets such as overcollateralized loans and undisclosed commercial paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Defendants did not maintain the same amount of reserves as Tether tokens in circulation. At times, Defendants had no reserves whatsoever. Further, these reserves did not contain U.S. dollars, as Tether suggested, but were a mix of other assets, such as overcollateralized loans and other undisclosed commercial paper.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced that he is officially accepting Bitcoin for his presidential campaign donations.</p>
Crypto-Friendly Mayer from Miami&nbsp;
<p>On Friday, August 4, Miami Mayer and Republican candidate for the 2024 Presidential Election, Francis Suarez, confirmed that his campaign would be accepting donations in Bitcoin. He clarified that his supporters can donate as little as 0.00034 BTC, equivalent to $1, at his website.</p>

<p>"Officially, my campaign is accepting Bitcoin," Suarez announced. "This is a process of developing technologies that are going to create democratizing opportunities for wealth creation and are not manipulated by a human being's ulterior motives, political goals, etc."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suarez heavily criticized the Biden administration for its approach towards cryptocurrencies which involves regulation through enforcement, without understanding the mechanisms of digital assets or setting clear rules.</p>

<p>"The biggest mistake that this administration has made is they don't understand crypto so they have gone to a regulated-by-enforcement mechanism as opposed to set the ground rules," Suarez explained. "You have to be able to classify certain digital products, you have to be able to have certain guidelines and rules that are clear with respect to the custody of assets."</p>

<p>The candidate also declared that, if elected the President, he would ban the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC):</p>

<p>"Nobody wants the federal government knowing where you have your money and how much money you have ... I don't think that there's anything particularly innovative about that."</p>

<p>Francis Suarez announced his candidacy for the upcoming presidential race in June 2023. He argued that the country needs a president who understands how cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Miami Mayer has long been a supporter of Bitcoin and digital assets in general. He already launched his own cryptocurrency MiamiCoin (MIA) in 2021, and promised to make Miami a Bitcoin hub.</p>
Presidential Candidates Against CBDC
<p>Francis Suarez is not the only presidential hopeful who spoke out against CBDCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The governor of Florida and presidential candidate for the Republican party, Ron DeSantis, criticized the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s new payments system, FedNow, and said that the Biden administration&rsquo;s efforts towards launching a CBDC are &ldquo;about surveillance and control&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Ron DeSantis and another presidential hopeful of the Democratic party, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., implied they would not support the launch and use of a CBDC in the country. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has recently confirmed the purchase of BTC for his children, even though he had earlier denied investment in the digital currency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders and Democratic Senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bob Casey, and Richard Blumenthal, are urging the Biden administration to initiate a crackdown on &ldquo;crypto tax evaders&rdquo;.</p>

Coinbase Makes a Major Move in SEC Lawsuit
<p>On Friday, July 4, Coinbase filed a new motion seeking to dismiss the lawsuit started by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) entirely, after hinting at the major move in yesterday&rsquo;s Shareholder letter on the platform&rsquo;s Q2 earnings.</p>
<p>In the filing, Coinbase claims that the regular is exceeding its authority by suing the cryptocurrency exchange because the platform does not offer &ldquo;investment contracts&rdquo;.</p>

<p>"The transactions over Coinbase&rsquo;s platform and Prime are not, and do not involve, contractual undertakings to deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business. They are commodity sales, with the obligations on both sides discharged entirely the moment the digital token is delivered in exchange for payment," the filing stated.</p>

<p>The crypto exchange also referred to the recent ruling partially in favor of Ripple in a similar case against the SEC, saying that the core facts were "substantially identical to those alleged here." However, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the court will consider this argument, because another crypto company Terraform Labs also recently tried to cite the Ripple&rsquo;s case but was rejected by Judge Rakoff.</p>
Ongoing Legal Battle Against SEC
<p>As it was recently revealed, before suing the exchange, the SEC first asked Coinbase to halt all crypto trading except that of Bitcoin, arguing that all other digital assets are viewed as securities. Coinbase decided to decline the SEC&rsquo;s request. The company&rsquo;s CEO Brian Armostrong explained why:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We really didn&rsquo;t [did not] have a choice at that point; delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way, is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US. It kind of made it an easy choice&hellip; let&rsquo;s [let us] go to court and find out what the court says.&rdquo; </p>

<p>In June, the regulator filed suit against Coinbase alleging the platform failed to register as a broker, clearing agency, or national securities exchange and traded at least 13 cryptocurrencies that could be considered securities.&nbsp;</p>
Seeking Regulatory Clarity
<p>Coinbase has repeatedly asked for more clarity regarding crypto regulation from the SEC but still hasn&rsquo;t responded. The regulator requested four more months to provide a response to the platform&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>In its latest Shareholder letter, Coinbase highlighted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;despite our good faith efforts and transparency of our business to the SEC for years now, we were deeply disappointed that the SEC brought an unwarranted enforcement against us in June, and that ten states initiated proceedings about our staking services. We are confident in the work we have done to abide by all federal and state securities laws, and as we vigorously defend that work, we plan to use these proceedings as an opportunity to bring more clarity to our industry as a whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal expressed optimism regarding the case:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With respect to the litigation with the SEC, I want to be very clear. We do think we can win. We expect to win.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Today, the DeFi space witnessed a groundbreaking moment as Maya Protocol announced its integration with the Dash blockchain. This milestone marks the first-ever opportunity for Dash users to engage in decentralized and permissionless trading, unlocking a new era of possibilities.</p>
<p>Maya Protocol, a decentralized liquidity platform, empowers users to exchange cryptocurrency assets across multiple networks while retaining complete control of their tokens in a permissionless manner.</p>
<p>Dash, renowned for its focus on speed, privacy, and self-governance, is among the oldest cryptocurrencies still in circulation. Its continuous technological advancements and growing adoption as a digital payment method make it a highly usable cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>By integrating Dash into Maya, a seamless connection is established, enabling frictionless exchange between Dash and other crypto assets without relying on centralized intermediaries. The synergy between Dash's attributes and Maya's mission of facilitating fluid cross-chain liquidity amplifies the benefits of both protocols.</p>
<p>Maya's ability to handle Dash transactions sets it apart from others, demonstrating its expertise in the decentralized ecosystem, particularly in terms of interoperability and composability. Dash represents the first unique integration for Maya, compared to Thorchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of this collaboration, Maya gains exposure to Dash's extensive user base, loyal community, and real-world use cases as digital cash.</p>
<p>Retail users stand to benefit from increased trading opportunities (Maya supports BTC, ETH, RUNE, USDT, and USDC) and yield generation with their Dash tokens by becoming liquidity providers.</p>
<p>Beyond individual growth, this integration reflects the evolution and progress of the decentralized finance ecosystem. It showcases the potential of DeFi in driving innovation and disrupting traditional financial models.</p>
<p>Maya and Dash exemplify their commitment to pioneering decentralized systems and reshaping the financial landscape. To delve deeper into this game-changing integration, visit the official web resources of both protocols.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Traders and investors are always on the lookout for changes in market trends to capture maximum profits. Three top cryptos, Chainlink (LINK), Uniswap (UNI), and Pomerdoe (POMD)have captured the interest of many investors with their recent price actions. What are crypto market experts saying about future targets for these three cryptos?</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction
<p class="s6">Chainlink (LINK) caught the attention of many investors and traders for its major rally during the bear market of June. From June 20 to July 20, the price of Chainlink spiked by almost 70%. Starting at $5.1, Chainlink traded as high as $8.4 in July.</p>
<p class="s6">Chainlink now appears to have broken market structure, entering a bear market. Over the last two weeks, the price of Chainlink has tumbled by 15%. In addition, the number of whale transactions on Chainlink is now 78% fewer than they were two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="s6">The price of Chainlink now stands at $7.3, but data from Global In/Out of Money Around Price (GIOM) remains bearish. According to the firm, the price of Chainlink could continue its decline in the coming weeks and drop to the $6.5 support.</p>
Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction
<p class="s6">Uniswap also enjoyed a massive rally from June to July, increasing by 60%. Following its peak at $6.7, the price of Uniswap has tumbled down to $6.22. Despite growing bearish pressure, the price outlook of Uniswap remains fairly bullish.</p>
<p class="s6">With support at $6.0, the number of buyers are overtaking the number of sellers. If buyers successfully hold this price at the 200-day SMA, Uniswap could see a price increase in the coming days. However, the overall outlook of the crypto market could contribute to this.</p>
<p class="s6">Crypto analysts at Changelly have predicted that the price of Uniswap could top $7 in August. For 2023, the analysts have forecasted a maximum price of $8.44 for Uniswap.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Price Prediction
<p class="s6">Unlike Uniswap, crypto experts are more bullish about the prospects of Pomerdoge (POMD) in the coming weeks. Creating a revolutionary P2E game, crypto experts have given very bullish predictions for Pomerdoge.</p>
<p class="s6">In the Pomergame, players will create unique characters known as Pomerdoges. With their Pomerdoges, they will enter into competitions and challenges for amazing rewards. Pomerdogecombines the thrilling gameplay of the Pomergame with a social infrastructure allowing gamers from around the world to communicate.</p>
<p class="s6">With the prospects of combining the best features of top P2E games, the Pomerdoge utility token has been given very bullish ratings. Now in its first presale stage, you can buy a POMD token for as low as $0.007. However, crypto experts have predicted a 280% price surge over the next few weeks as the project prepares for launch.</p>
<p class="s6">One feature that has caught the attention of investors is the shared earnings of Pomerdoge. The team recently announced that early presale investors will receive a share of the game's earnings depending on their token holdings. This innovative model effectively aligns the interests of investors, leading to the growth of the Pomerdoge ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">The presale of Tradecurve has rejuvenated the crypto market, and bulls have become active too. According to analysts, this new project has massive growth potential, and can become a new market king soon.</p>
<p class="s6">It has emerged as a serious challenger to well-established titans like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which are facing sluggishness.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) Miners Suffer A Drop In Revenue
<p class="s6">A couple of months ago, Bitcoin (BTC) miners were raking in big revenues, due to the mania around the Ordinals protocol. However, as the hype around Ordinals wanes, transaction activity on the Bitcoin (BTC) network has returned to normal.</p>
<p class="s6">This has caused a slump in the revenue of Bitcoin (BTC) miners. As per the data from IntoTheBlock, transaction fees on the Bitcoin (BTC) network have plummeted by 38% since March. However, Bitcoin miners are holding onto their tokens as they hope for a further increase in the price of BTC.</p>
<p class="s6">Meanwhile, the market value of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a surge of 14% in the past 30 days. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) currently changes hands at $30,195.15.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Whales Sell Their Tokens
<p class="s6">The latest on-chain data has revealed that Ethereum (ETH) whales have aggressively sold off their tokens. For instance, an Ethereum whale recently sold 4,549 ETH tokens worth about $8.78 million.</p>
<p class="s6">The whale bought Ethereum (ETH) tokens on January 9 at a price of $1,319. According to market experts, the sell-off pattern indicates that Ethereum (ETH) whales want to cash out the benefits before any unforeseen market downfall in future. Interestingly, after the court&rsquo;s verdict in the SEC-XRP case, Ethereum (ETH) surged to approximately $2030. But since then, Ethereum&rsquo;s (ETH) value has suffered a drop of more than 5%.</p>
<p class="s6">At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,910.38.</p>
Tradecurve's Momentum Aligns with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): A Triumvirate Fueling Market Revival
<p class="s6">In a remarkable synergy with the established giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Tradecurve is infusing a fresh dynamism into the market, showcasing its potential to stand alongside the titans.</p>
<p class="s6">Crypto aficionados have long been looking for an exchange that could help them trade several assets with one account. To meet this growing demand, Tradecurve has entered the crypto arena. It is a comprehensive decentralized exchange that allows the trading of several assets on a single user interface. The asset classes available here include cryptocurrencies, stocks, Forex, bonds, and more.</p>
<p class="s6">Since the demand for decentralized exchange has surged to a new high, this new platform can soon become a market leader. CoinGecko&rsquo;s data showed that the growth rate of decentralized exchanges in Q1 2023 was more than 33%.</p>
<p class="s6">The platform enables people to trade a wide range of assets without relying on fiat payments. The platform ensures that the identities of its users are never revealed as traders need not go through any KYC verification process. This feature makes it more privacy-focused than existing exchanges, such as Bakkt and Revolut, where traders must submit their private details.</p>
<p class="s6">The platform will give exclusive deposit and level-up bonuses, among other perks. It also offers a VIP account service and high-leverage trading that starts from 500:1. Besides, it is equipped with a mechanism that ensures negative balance protection. The presale of the platform&rsquo;s native token, TCRV, is currently running at a price tag of $0.025.</p>
<p class="s6">TCRV tokens have been built on the Ethereum blockchain. As per market forecast, the tokens&rsquo; value will increase by 50x during the presale, and 100x after launch on multiple CEXs and Uniswap. The platform has already more than 17,000 registered users to its presale.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Narrow Range After 29399:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 5 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained in a narrow range early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 29164 area, a downside price objective related to recent selling pressure around the 30350.70 and 29686.41 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bears kept BTC/USD below the 29399.97 area during a move higher that represented a test of a previous downside price objective related to selling pressure around the 30421 and 29851 levels.&nbsp; Minor buying pressure emerged around the 29083.19 area, right around a previous upside price objective associated with buying pressure around the 28850 area.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 27979, 27409, 27246, and 26501 levels.&nbsp; Below the market, additional downside price objectives include the 28213, 28137, 27757, 27430, 27338, 27312, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent upside activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 28306, 27466, 26428, and 26272 levels.&nbsp; Traders are monitoring the recent depreciating range from 31862.21 to 28850 with upside retracement levels around the 30356, 30711, 31151, and 31217 areas.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29260.19 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29199.93.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>ProShares has become the eleventh to apply to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register an Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
Multiple Filings By ProShares
<p>ProShares has joined the ranks of other asset managers seeking to register an Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A total of 11 applications for Ether futures ETFs were submitted to the SEC within a week, with ProShares filing for four separate applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among them is an equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether ETF that will track the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts. The asset manager has also filed for two other Ethereum-focused ETFs: Short Ether Strategy ETF and ProShares Ether Strategy ETF.</p>
Wave Of Ether-Based ETF Applications
<p>ProShares was not alone in the race for Ether ETFs. The surge in applications began when Volatility Shares filed for the Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF on July 28. Subsequently, Bitwise Asset Management, Roundhill Financial, Van Eck, ProShares, Grayscale Investments, Direxion, and Valkyrie Investments followed suit, all proposing new Ether futures ETFs.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the SEC has not yet approved any ETF that tracks Ether futures contracts, though Bitcoin futures ETFs have been around since October 2021.</p>
Volatility Could Be First Ether ETF
<p>If the applications go uncontested, the Ether ETFs are set to launch 75 days from their respective filing dates, with Volatility Shares ETF expected to be the first, launching on Oct. 12.</p>
<p>With $173.5 million managed across four exchange-traded funds, the investment firm has the potential to be the first to issue an ETF focused on Ether. Its proposed Ether Strategy ETF (ETHU) aims to invest up to 25% of its assets in cash-settled Ether futures contracts traded on the CFTC-regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).&nbsp;</p>
Spot BTC ETFs Coming Soon
<p>This surge in Ether-focused ETF applications comes alongside a flurry of filings from major asset management firms looking to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is among those seeking to offer the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.</p>
<p>As the SEC reviews these applications, the crypto market eagerly awaits the possibility of new investment opportunities through Ether and Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairperson, has expressed serious concern for AI technology, calling it a serious threat to financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
Gensler Pivoting Regulatory Eye To AI
<p>Under the leadership of its chairperson, the SEC has shifted its focus from cryptocurrency to artificial intelligence (AI), recognizing it as a technology that "warrants the hype." Gensler, who previously dealt with crypto industry scams and fraud, now views AI as the most transformative technology of this generation and warns of the risks it may pose if not properly regulated.</p>
<p>Gensler emphasizes that mass automation driven by AI can have far-reaching implications for the trillions of dollars in assets traded on SEC-regulated markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While AI's predictive capabilities can benefit firms in better serving their clients, there's a concern that it might also be used to obscure responsibility when things go wrong, potentially leading to significant market risks.</p>
A Long-Standing Interest In AI Technology
<p>Gary Gensler has a well-established history with AI, dating back to 1997 when he first delved into it after witnessing Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov's defeat against IBM's supercomputer, Deep Blue. His involvement with AI deepened during his tenure as an MIT professor, leading to his co-authoring a 2020 paper, &ldquo;Deep Learning and Financial Stability,&rdquo; that examined the risks posed by deep learning to the financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He claimed that existing financial laws do not have the capacity to address the dangers of algorithmic deep learning. He believes that developers can create AI functions without any limits, and these functions might work against fair market ethics.</p>
Calls for Better Regulation
<p>Gensler asserts that existing regulatory frameworks are ill-equipped to manage the risks associated with AI. He highlights the potential challenges of coordinating AI models among major trading houses, which could lead to increased market volatility and instability. To address the conflict, Gensler has proposed one of the first regulatory frameworks for AI, urging trading houses and money managers to assess whether their use of AI or predictive data could create conflicts of interest.</p>
No Loosening of Crypto Enforcement
<p>Despite pivoting the SEC's attention to AI, Gensler's focus on crypto enforcement remains strong. Numerous lawsuits involving major cryptocurrency firms, such as Ripple, Binance, and Coinbase, are currently pending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has also faced severe criticism from leading market experts like Tim Draper and lawmakers like Ritchie Torres for his stance against crypto, calling it detrimental to the industry and the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the landscape of both AI and crypto continues to evolve, market participants will be closely watching the SEC's actions and decisions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Former smartphone giant BlackBerry&rsquo;s cybersecurity division has identified notorious malware families that are exclusively targeting cryptocurrencies and the crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prominent malware includes the likes of RaccoonStealer, SmokeLoader, and Vidar, which hijack computers belonging to unsuspecting users for crypto mining or theft.&nbsp;</p>
BlackBerry Identifies Significant Threats&nbsp;
<p>The findings were published in a &ldquo;Global Threat Intelligence Report&rdquo; published on Thursday. In the report, the former smartphone giant states that they successfully averted over 1.5 million cyberattacks between the months of March and May. The company added that the primary target of these attacks was the healthcare, financial, and government sectors. BlackBerry published the report on X, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think only enterprises get hacked? If you&rsquo;re a mid-market or small business, you still have a big target on your small or mid-size back. BlackBerry&rsquo;s@aboutsecurity shares why cybercriminals select targets based on impact &amp; how much they&rsquo;re willing to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most significant threats identified during this period was RedLine, a commodity malware that can harvest information such as saved credentials, crypto, and credit card information. RedLine was used to breach Hatch Bank, a fintech banking platform, leading to the loss of significant banking data and crypto. BlackBerry noted in its report,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;During this reporting period, BlackBerry telemetry observed a continuous trend in the use of commodity malware such as RedLine, which can harvest information including saved credentials, credit card information, and cryptocurrency.&rdquo;</p>

Malware Targeting Crypto&nbsp;
<p>The company also identified several other malware families specifically designed to hijack and use computers for mining purposes. These include RaccoonStealer, Vidar, and SmokeLoader. SmokeLoader, a rogue financial tool, is of particular concern and has been used by Russian hackers and threat actors for rogue crypto mining. RaccoonStealer, a malware that can be sourced from the dark web, has been designed to specifically target crypto wallets and steal information. The malware is capable of obtaining passwords, cookies, web browser data, and cryptocurrency wallet data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another malware, Vidar, targets Linux users and extracts information from crypto wallets and exchanges. Hackers routinely target Linux systems because they are vulnerable to mining attacks. BlackBerry has advised companies to apply security patches to secure themselves from attacks orchestrated by the malware families in question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vidar harvests banking information, browser credentials, and cryptocurrency wallets, as well as standard files.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The report also highlighted the Clop ransomware, which was used to target banking and financial institutions. This particular ransomware was also responsible for a data breach at Hatch Bank. The report also highlighted the growing threat to critical sectors from hackers and such malware, emphasizing the importance and urgency for companies to bolster their cybersecurity practices to counter these threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hackers have also introduced the Promotei botnet to target Linux-based servers to mine cryptocurrencies such as Monero. Given the botnet&rsquo;s advanced features, tracing and stopping it has been notoriously difficult.</p>
The Crypto Space And Cybersecurity&nbsp;
<p>SonicWall, a cybersecurity firm, has, in a recent report, stated that crypto-jacking incidents have risen a staggering 399% year-on-year. Most of the entities behind these attempts are based in regions where mining bans and sanctions are in force. An estimate by Statista projects the cybersecurity market to reach $162 billion in 2023 on the back of increasing threats to the crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent hack targeting an exchange occurred on the 22nd of July when North Korean hackers from the notorious Lazarus Group targeted the Coinspaid exchange and stole around $37 million.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In light of the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding digital currencies in the US, Revolut has decided to shut down its crypto offerings in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By October 3, 2023, US-based users of Revolut will experience a halt in their crypto services, preventing any further transactions on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the broader crypto industry grapples with the SEC's viewpoint, which leans towards classifying a significant portion of digital currencies as securities, Revolut has taken proactive steps. The company has already delisted Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) given that the SEC had opined that they were securities. Their removal is set to be finalised by September 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First published in an article earlier today by Decrypt, a spokesperson for Revolut told the news platform:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a result of the evolving regulatory environment and the uncertainties around the crypto market in the US, we&rsquo;ve taken the difficult decision, together with our US banking partner, to suspend access to cryptocurrencies through Revolut in the U.S. This decision has not been taken lightly, and we understand the disappointment this may cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regulatory action began ramping up when the SEC moved against major players in the crypto industry. The allegations, made by the SEC, centred around registration discrepancies, and have been met with counter arguments by the implicated platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the challenges in the US, Revolut's global crypto initiatives are on a steady course. The company has been continuing to expand in regions such as Europe. A popular staking program, available to users in the UK and several European countries, offered the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency rewards, and was well received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision to shutter its crypto services in the US, set to commence on September 2, 2023, highlights the issues between innovation in the crypto space and the ever-evolving regulatory frameworks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the US continues to provide what is seen as a muddy and opaque framework for cryptocurrencies going forward, it is likely to lose far more companies of the calibre of Revolut, as Asia and Europe step up in an effort to capture the markets that such an innovative technology provides.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the West far more attention is paid to the US as regards crypto, but China and Asia in general are the ones buying.</p>
A US in turmoil not good for crypto
<p>With the US debt pile increasing rapidly from its current impossibly sized $32 trillion on which $1 trillion interest needs to be paid annually, and a government and its financial watchdogs trying their best to suppress and close down crypto companies, this cannot be the best jurisdiction to support the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The US debt cannot be funded, and the Federal Reserve pushing up interest rates will only serve to close smaller businesses and put American people out of work. The crypto industry would create jobs, but it appears that this US administration does not want them.</p>
<p>A recent downgrade of the US by the Fitch ratings agency would suggest that the cat is out of the bag and the craziness of US economic policy, and the ineptness of its government is being called to account.</p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, and obviously a staunch supporter of the US banking system, said of the downgrade:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really matter that much. The markets decide, not the rating agencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr Dimon might want to hope and pray that the markets carry on turning a blind eye to the house of cards that the US has become. Buying its own debt, and just being able to print more money doesn&rsquo;t provide the solid base that its economy needs.</p>
Crypto exchanges worldwide tell an interesting story
<p>So where does this leave crypto?</p>
<p>As per data from The Block, on North American exchanges for the month of July, a total of $42 billion in exchange volume was achieved. For exchanges based in Europe for the same month, the volume was $18 billion, and for those based in Asia it was a whopping $340 billion, which dwarfs that of both North America and Europe combined.</p>
<p>These figures mean that the crypto trading market is only really happening in Asia, with around 8 times the volume of that taking place in North America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what of China? Crypto trading has been banned here. So why, according to the Wall Street Journal, did Binance just do a monthly crypto trading volume of $90 billion in China? This volume also makes China the biggest contributor of trading volume to Binance worldwide.</p>
<p>Either China has had a major rethink on crypto, or it just cannot suppress crypto within its own borders. But then if one looks to its overseas territory of Hong Kong, and how it is starting to give out licences to crypto companies and is setting itself up to be one of the major crypto hubs for Asia, it gives a bit more insight into the Chinese new thinking on crypto.</p>
<p>The US is tearing itself apart with poor government and internal division, and is in the process of excluding a new and innovative technology from its shores. China could certainly be the major beneficiary of this poorly thought out US policy.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US SEC on Thursday secured a temporary asset freeze, restraining order and further emergency relief against Digital Licensing, a Draper, Utah-based entity operating as DEBT Box. </p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it had obtained emergency relief against DEBT Box and four of the company&rsquo;s principals.</p>
<p>In its continued crackdown on crypto fraud, the SEC obtained a temporary asset freeze, restraining order, and other emergency relief against Digital Licensing Inc., a Draper, Utah-based entity operating as &ldquo;DEBT Box.&rdquo; The agency also acted against four of the company&rsquo;s principals, Jason Anderson, his brother Jacob Anderson, Schad Brannon, and Roydon Nelson, along with 13 other defendants for their connecting to a scheme to sell crypto asset securities to US investors which raised around $50 million and an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).</p>
<p>According to the securities agency, the defendant sold unregistered securities called &ldquo;node licenses&rdquo; to unsuspecting victims. In the scheme, which started operating in March 2021, the defendants said to investors that the licenses would mine crypto and, in turn, increase in value when the defendants actually created the crypto using code on a blockchain.</p>
<p>Tracy S. Combs, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Salt Lake Regional Office, said in a press release:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We allege that DEBT Box and its principals lied to investors about virtually every material aspect of their unregistered offering of securities, including by falsely stating that they were engaged in crypto asset mining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We filed this emergency action to protect the victims of the defendants&rsquo; unlawful actions and stop further harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The SEC charged the 18 defendants, including the four principals mentioned above, with engaging in unregistered securities offerings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;DEBT Box, Jason Anderson, Jacob Anderson, Brannon, Nelson, Franklin, Western Oil, and Bowen were also charged with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Jason Anderson, Jacob Anderson, Brannon, Nelson, Bowen, Mark Schuler, Benjamin Daniels, Joseph Martinez, Travis Flaherty, Brendon Stangis, Matthew Fritzsche, B &amp; B Investment Group, LLC, and iX Global, LLC were charged with acting as unregistered brokers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The SEC charges seek permanent injunctive relief, the return of the ill-gotten gains, and further civil penalties.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>London, UK, August 4th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Shiba Memu, a buzzing new AI-backed crypto meme coin, is creating more stir as it surges past the $1.5 million fundraising milestone and makes its exchange announcement debut with a BitMart listing &ndash; all within just one month of its presale starting.</p><p>Getting listed on an established exchange like Bitmart, a significant player since 2017 that showcases an impressive roster of over 1500 cryptocurrency pairs, underscores a smart strategic play for the project.</p><p>The main idea behind Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI was born out of the team's experiences with excessive marketing agency fees in previous business endeavors. This motivated them to take the initiative, developing a self-promoting AI that can scale into a variety of practical applications.</p><p>The tangible concept, combined with the appealing Shiba Memu mascot, has fueled a wave of interest from investors and crypto enthusiasts who recognize the long-term potential of the project.</p><p>Shiba Memu is currently priced at $0.0181, with a scheduled price increase every 24 hours, courtesy of the team's expertly programmed smart contract. This enticing mechanism is especially appealing to presale fans, as it guarantees the token purchase price will always be lower than the eventual exchange listing price.
