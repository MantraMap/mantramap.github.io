<p>Authorities <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-heads-brooklyn-jail-notorious-poor-conditions-2023-08-14/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-heads-brooklyn-jail-notorious-poor-conditions-2023-08-14/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transferred</a> former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to a federal jail in Brooklyn after a U.S. revoked SBF&#8217;s $250 million bail bond. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was moved to Brooklyn&#8217;s Metropolitan Detention Center  (MDC) ahead of his trial starting in October. SBF&#8217;s previously lived at his parents&#8217; home in Palo Alto, California until last week. </p>



<p>Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled to cancel SBF&#8217;s bail conditions after reviewing arguments on his alleged witness tampering. Prosecutors raised complaints after Bankman-Fried leaked Caroline Ellison&#8217;s private diary to the New York Times. His lawyers subsequently asked the court to seal the dairy, a move that puzzled observers while the Justice Department <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/doj-sam-bankman-fried-jail-nyt-article/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/doj-sam-bankman-fried-jail-nyt-article/" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> for jail time. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-appeal-remand-arrest/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-appeal-remand-arrest/" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> Judge Kaplan&#8217;s decision to revoke bail shortly after his arrest. However, SBF will likely prepare his defense from a federal prison cell.</p>



<p>Inmates of Brooklyn&#8217;s MDC like former president of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernandez and exiled Asian businessman Guo Wengui both described the prison as dangerous. This is the second prison Bankman-Fried has checked into since FTX&#8217;s collapse. </p>



<p>SBF was previously held at the Fox Hill Prison in the Bahamas, another prison notorious for its poor conditions. </p>



<h2>Charges Against Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>Prosecutors charged SBF on 12 counts including fraud following the crash of FTX last November. Authorities dialed back on campaign finance violation charges due to an issue with Sam&#8217;s extradition papers from the Bahamas. This particular charge was not included in the agreement, per reports. </p>



<p>SBF&#8217;s trial is scheduled to begin on October 2 in what experts say is the biggest fraud case in America&#8217;s history. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following significant coin distribution between February 2021 and May 2022, Cardano [ADA] investors that hold over 100,000 ADA coins have again begun accumulating the crypto asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Santiment, these investors have continued to “fill their bags” with ADA despite the steady decline in the altcoin’s value. The coin shaved off 35% of its market capitalization in the last four months. At press time, this was $10.16 billion, making it the eighth-largest crypto asset in terms of market capitalization.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since this cohort of ADA investors began accumulating the coin, its value has dropped by 69%. As of May 2022, ADA traded above $0.7. At press time, it exchanged hands for under $0.3. </span></p>
<h3><b>ADA is on a loss-making streak</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-chain assessment of how profitable ADA has been as a digital asset in the last year revealed that the majority of holders have failed to turn profits since April 2022. According to <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/Y67Rvd5H__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>, the coin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio turned negative on 7 April that year and remained below the center line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This metric tracks the ratio between an asset’s current price and the average price of its every coin/token acquired. A high MVRV ratio indicates that the asset is overvalued, while a low MVRV ratio indicates that it is undervalued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At -51.36% at press time, it meant that if all holders sold ADA at its current value, more than half of them would realize losses.</span></p>

<h4><b>No rally in sight</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its price declining further, daily traders have continued to distribute ADA. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 42.99 at press time, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 23.67, almost oversold.</span></p>

<h2>Short-Lived BALD Hype On Base</h2>



<p>BALD, a memecoin seemingly inspired by the distinct haircut of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, achieved overnight success before crashing to ruin. The token grew to over $80 million in market cap and became popular on Base, the L2 network backed by Armstrong&#8217;s crypto exchange Coinbase. </p>



<p>Base is also the first decentralized network <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> by a publicly traded company domiciled in the U.S.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-1024x576.png" alt="Base-BALD Deployer Bridges $12.9 Million To Ethereum, Moves 2,100 ETH To Kraken 7" class="wp-image-583654" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-1024x576.png 1024w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-300x169.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-770x433.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-1536x864.png 1536w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-269x151.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-746x420.png 746w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong-1376x774.png 1376w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coinbase-CEO-Brian-Armstrong.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Base-BALD Deployer Bridges $12.9 Million To Ethereum, Moves 2,100 ETH To Kraken 10"><figcaption><strong>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although moving funds to Base worked through a one-way portal, degens speculated on BALD&#8217;s price ascending higher. Holders were left struck out after the token deployer suddenly <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrew liquidity</a> in an apparent rug pull. The coin&#8217;s price declined afterward and never recovered. </p>



<p>Regarding the identity of the mysterious BALD deployer, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT shared clues pointing to a pseudonymous user known as @milkyway16eth. The suspected individual sent $50,000 in crypto to another in 2021 with the same addresses used to deploy BALD&#8217;s smart contract. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not proven or confirmed that @milkyway16eth is indeed the BALD deploy, although the user went private after the info came to light. </p>

The disgraced <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ryan-salame-plea-deal-prosecutors/">FTX</a> founder was handcuffed and escorted out of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York earlier today after federal Judge Lewis Kaplan remanded him into custody ahead of his trial, which is set to begin on October 2, 2023. </p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried Jailed For Witness Tampering</strong></h2>



<p>Inner City Press <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690106507436646400" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today that Judge Kaplan remanded Sam Bankman-Fried to jail due to his attempts to tamper with a key witness in the Department of Justice’s case against him. The judge also highlighted the FTX founder’s decision to leak the private writings of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison with the New York Times last month. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“In view of the evidence, my conclusion is that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has attempted to tamper with witnesses at least twice…” </p><cite>SDNY Judge Lewis A. Kaplan</cite></blockquote>



<p>After Bankman-Fried’s bail was revoked, he was handcuffed by U.S. Marshals and escorted out of the courtroom. As for Bankman-Fried’s jail arrangements, Assistant United States Attorney Danielle Sassoon proposed that he be held at the Putnam County Correctional Facility in New York and the Manhattan Detention Center during his trial. </p>

<p>Within an hour of Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail revocation and subsequent arrest, his legal defense team led by Mark Cohen appealed his remand to jail. Cohen had previously stated his intent to appeal and asked Judge Kaplan for a written order of bail revocation for the same. According to Inner City Press, an electronic filing for the appeal has been made, complete with a filing fee of $505.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cameron Winklevoss has <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1690049346803245056" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to the Digital Currency Group’s motion to dismiss the fraud lawsuit filed by Gemini last month. DCG’s filing on August 10 claimed that Winklevoss’ crypto firm had failed to support the fraud alleged against the crypto conglomerate and its founder Barry Silbert. In response, Winklevoss, who serves as Gemini’s president, has accused DCG and its chief of playing dumb in order to avoid responsibility. </p>



<h2><strong>Good Luck In Front Of A Jury: Gemini’s Cameron Winklevoss</strong></h2>



<p>The Digital Currency Group’s motion to dismiss Gemini’s lawsuit highlighted that the complaint named DCG as the defendant, despite it having no direct business dealing with Cameron Winklevoss’ crypto exchange. The crypto conglomerate added that Gemini’s allegations pertaining to its transaction with its subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Silbert’s firm accused the Winklevoss twins of mounting a character assassination campaign on Twitter, to deflect the blame from the stranded customers of Gemini Earn Program. DCG also called out Gemini for avoiding responsibility, having actively promoted Genesis as a “sophisticated market participant” to its customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an X (formerly Twitter) post earlier today, Winklevoss described DCG’s motion to dismiss as a brief written by a law school student making up baseless legal defenses. According to the Gemini founder, the motion was in line with Silbert’s playbook of refusing to take responsibility, playing dumb, and attempting to avoid accountability using technicalities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Good luck making these arguments to a jury of your peers. See you in court.</p><cite>Cameron Winklevoss</cite></blockquote>



<p>Winklevoss also took issue with DCG’s claim of owing no direct duty to Gemini to correct the allegedly false statements made by Genesis. “When a company you own says you wrote a $1.1 billion check that you know you didn’t write, yes, you have a duty to correct this. Sorry, but this doesn’t even pass the giggle test,” the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-hints-xrp-relisting-price-up-4/">Gemini</a> founder added. </p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is inviting new public commentary on the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application, delaying a decision on the filing as expected by ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood. </p>



<p>By standard procedure, the SEC has 240 days to deliver a final decision on an application after initiating the review process. </p>



<p>Stakeholders who are interested in contributing to the discourse were urged to submit &#8220;written data, views, and arguments&#8221; within a 21-day timeframe. Back in June, the regulatory authority laid out its intent to &#8220;approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove&#8221; the application by the stipulated date of August 13.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pretty Standard,&#8221; Bloomberg&#8217;s Eric Balchunas said regarding the SEC&#8217;s request for public input on the proposed rule change.  </p>



<p>ARK Invest CEO Cathi Wood foresaw the delay, per an interview. &#8220;I think the SEC, if it&#8217;s going to approve a bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once.&#8221; Wood <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-08-07/wood-sec-could-approve-more-than-one-bitcoin-etf-video" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-08-07/wood-sec-could-approve-more-than-one-bitcoin-etf-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> predicting simultaneous approvals from the SEC in the future. </p>

<h2>8 Bitcoin ETFs In-Play</h2>



<p>The SEC has received eight Bitcoin ETF applications including filings from BlackRock and Fidelity. Issuers seem in a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-assess-valkyries-spot-bitcoin-etf/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-assess-valkyries-spot-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">race</a> to clinch the inaugural Bitcoin ETF, a product that would allow a swathe of American investors access to Bitcoin without actually holding the cryptocurrency. </p>



<p>BlackRock CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larry Fink</a> opined that approval is a matter of when, not if, hinting at the approval of his firm&#8217;s submission in four to six months.</p>



<p>Historically, the SEC has denied Bitcoin ETF applications on the grounds of market manipulation and inadequate surveillance. The prevailing rebuttal points to the approval of Bitcoin Futures ETFs, a similar product.</p>

<p>DeBank is the latest DeFi player to adopt Optimism&#8217;s OP stack for its own blockchain solution. Indeed, the OP stack has become popular among service providers looking to build tools that offer cheap on-chain transactions at scale. </p>



<p>Base, the layer 2 network backed by crypto exchange Coinbase, also built its recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-decentralized-l2-network-base/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> mainnet using Optimism&#8217;s developer kit. Users bridged ~ $170 million in crypto from Ethereum to Base less than 24 hours after the network launched. </p>



<p>Other decentralized networks like Mantle and OpBNB also chose OP stack for their chains. </p>

<p>The community behind the leading DeFi lending protocol Aave has voted in favor of a <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=289" rel="nofollow noopener">governance proposal</a> that seeks to acquire 5 million Curve DAO Tokens (CRV). The community was visibly divided over the proposal, with more than 42.19% of the votes against the CRV acquisition deal. However, nearly 58% of the community voted to proceed with the deal, which is expected to be implemented within 24 hours. </p>



<h2><strong>Aave To Use 2 Million USDT From Treasury To Acquire CRV</strong></h2>



<p>According to Aave’s governance <a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-acquire-crv-with-treasury-usdt/14251" rel="nofollow noopener">forum</a>, the decentralized finance protocol will use 2 million USDT from the Aave DAO treasury to strategically acquire 5 million CRV. The CRV purchase aims to support the DeFi ecosystem following the instability induced by the recent Curve Finance exploits. </p>



<p>Aave DAO is also looking to position itself strategically in the Curve Wars. The Curve Wars is a competition between several DeFi protocols to secure a large portion of Curve Finance’s liquidity by ensuring that their preferred pools offer the highest CRV rewards. The allocation of CRV rewards to pools is influenced by protocols that hold the most veCRV tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from supporting DeFi and strategizing for the Curve Wars, Aave is also hoping to incentivize liquidity for its native stablecoin <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-dao-approves-deploy-gho-ethereum/">GHO</a>. The DeFi protocol plans to lock the CRV tokens in order to accumulate Curve voting power and support a GHO-specific gauge, which would benefit GHO secondary liquidity. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The treasury balance and the predicted lower costs for service providers for the 2023-2024 budget would allow this strategic acquisition while maintaining a conservative stance with DAO treasury holdings.”</p><cite>Aave governance forum</cite></blockquote>



<p>The community is currently mulling over two other proposals that seek to limit its exposure to CRV. The first proposal aims to reduce the liquidation threshold by 6% for CRV on Aave Ethereum V2. The proposal is poised for approval, with 100% of the votes currently in favor. The second proposal seeks to disable the borrowing of CRV on Ethereum and Polygon V3. This proposal has not been met with any resistance so far and is set to be implemented after August 13, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Binance Labs, the crypto exchange&#8217;s venture capitalist and incubator arm, plans to invest $5 million in CRV, Curve DAO&#8217;s token and a widely used crypto in Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized finance ecosystem. CRV will also deploy on BNB Chain as part of the agreement.</p>



<p>With $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) per DeFiLlama, Curve is comfortably DeFi&#8217;S second-largest exchange and the largest stableswap platform for decentralized participants. Binance said the commitment to CRV directly helps to shape DeFi&#8217;s future and propel growth within the industry, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$5m-in-curve-dao-token-crv-and-supports-curve-deployment-to-bnb-chain-4372009526169554266" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$5m-in-curve-dao-token-crv-and-supports-curve-deployment-to-bnb-chain-4372009526169554266" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs Yi He. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Given the recent events that have impacted the protocol, Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration.</p></blockquote>



<h2>SEAL 911 Assembled Amid Curve Recovery</h2>



<p>Nearly two weeks after a reentrancy exploit, Curve Finance has recovered roughly three-quarters of ~ $70 million drained from liquidity pools on the platform. Affected protocols like Alchemix either had the stolen funds <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/52-million-recovered-curve-finance-heist/">returned</a> by exploiters or recovered by white hat hackers. </p>



<p>Curve Finance is yet to recover assets from the CRV/ETH pools at the time of writing. The protocol put out a bounty of $1.8 million, around 10% of the outstanding funds, for any information on the exploiters&#8217; identity. </p>



<p>The incident also galvanized a collaborative initiative comprised of white hat hackers, auditors, and security experts. SEAL 911, a telegram chatbot <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-defi-first-responder-telegram-bot/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-defi-first-responder-telegram-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by Paradigm head of security Sam (@samczsun) connects any user to a pool of vetted professionals offering assistance in emergency cases like the hacks on CRV pools and Euler. </p>

<p>Base, the L2 Ethereum network backed and built by crypto exchange Coinbase, is officially open for public access. </p>



<p>100 decentralized apps and crypto service providers like Chainlink are available on the blockchain at launch. Moreover, Base features an official <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/" rel="noreferrer noopener">bridge</a> to Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet allowing users to freely move ETH between both networks.</p>



<p>The launch of Base also coincides with the company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1689315339006574592?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1689315339006574592?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Onchain Summer</a>&#8221; week-long event featuring commemorative NFTs and rewards for users. </p>



<p>Coinbase is the first-ever publicly traded entity in the U.S. to launch its own decentralized network. The company does not plan to launch a token for its Base L2 blockchain. </p>



<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s Secret Plan</h2>



<p>The decentralized network developed using Optimism&#8217;s OP stack is part of &#8220;The Coinbase Secret Master Plan&#8221;, said CEO Brian Armstrong when Base was announced back in February. </p>



<p>By mid July, would-be early users trooped into Base despite the network being only accessible to developers at the time. Several &#8220;degens&#8221; bridged their Ether (ETH) tokens to the network through a portal proxy contract, a one-way door from Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem to Base. The gateway allowed these users to make millions overnight aping into risky memecoins like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" rel="noreferrer noopener">BALD</a>.</p>



<p>BALD holders however soon found themselves rekt after the token&#8217;s developer withdrew liquidity in what turned out to be a rug pull. A number of other memecoins on Base also turned out to be scams as well. At the time, Base users only had access to a one-way bridge, leaving liquidity trapped in the budding ecosystem. </p>
