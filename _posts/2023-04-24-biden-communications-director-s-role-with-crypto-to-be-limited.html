<p>President Joe Biden will bar his newly appointed communications director, Ben LaBolt, from participating in legal matters, investigations and contracts involving crypto firms he previously worked with. </p>
<p>The Biden administration&rsquo;s newly appointed communications director will be forbidden from &ldquo;participating in legal matters, investigations, or contracts involving cryptocurrency or technology firms he previously represented,&rdquo; Bloomberg Law reports.</p>
<p>LaBolt previously represented firms, including Meta Platforms Inc., Shopify Inc., and venture capital firm Haun Ventures LLC. His clients also included West Street &ndash; a family office of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.</p>
<p>However, Ben LaBolt, who joined the Administration only last month, will be allowed to advise President Biden on regulating cryptocurrency and social media companies.</p>
<p>A White House ethics disclosure reveals LaBolt also dealt with crypto exchange Uniswap and Andreessen Horowitz &ndash; an early investor in Coinbase Global. The communications director was a partner at outcomes agency Bully Pulpit Interactive (BPI).</p>
LaBolt Holds Bitcoin and Ether
<p>LaBolt was appointed amid the increasing pressure on the White House to improve its engagement in Washington&rsquo;s approach to digital assets. The Biden administration has been publicly criticized for its crypto approach as its attempts to stifle the industry continues.</p>
<p>Crypto executives have also complained, &ldquo;that the industry lacks clear rules and investors are facing billions of dollars in potential losses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although LaBolt&rsquo;s role in cryptocurrency will be limited, it is a bullish sign on the Administration&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>LaBolt has publicly disclosed that he has stakes in both Bitcoin and Ether.</p>
