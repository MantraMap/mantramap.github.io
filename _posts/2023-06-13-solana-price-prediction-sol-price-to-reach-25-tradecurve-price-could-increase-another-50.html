<p>Two digital currencies, Solana and Tradecurve, have been generating excitement recently within the crypto space. Although the Solana blockchain witnessed numerous shutdowns in 2022, the network has bounced back with several new developments in 2023 which could push SOL, its native token towards the $25 price level. Meanwhile, Tradecurve, a promising DeFi project, is poised for another huge price surge of about 50% as investors show huge interest in its token presale.</p>

Solana (SOL) Price To Reach $25
<p>Solana has been on an upward trajectory, surpassing the $20 mark as it shows strong momentum. Factors contributing to its recent price gains include increased user engagement, notable upgrades such as the ChatGPT plugin integration, and positive remarks from the project's co-founder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently, Solana faces a resistance level of $21.40, which, if breached, could potentially propel the cryptocurrency toward a significant price rally, targeting the $25 price level. Trading expert Jimie (@Your_NLP_Coach) identifies the next resistance level at $26, emphasizing the need for Solana's price to close above $21.3 to confirm further upward movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other market analysts have predicted that if Solana (SOL) breaks out of this resistance, the token could experience a 28% rally. If this happens, the price of Solana (SOL) could be priced as high as $28 in the next few weeks. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Solana is trading at $20.20, a 1.20% increase in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

Tradecurve (TCRV) Price Could Increase Another 50%&nbsp;
<p>As the bullish sentiment surrounding Solana increases, traders are preparing to test the resistance level at $21.50. Tradecurve is already in the midst of a bull market. In May, which was a bearish month for the crypto market, Tradecurve's governance token, TCRV, experienced a remarkable 50% surge amidst a spike in interest from both retail and institutional investors. Expert analysts even project that June could bring another rally for Tradecurve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple factors could help TCRV record another 50% price hike. One of them is its utility. Also, Tradecurve is building a decentralized platform that will offer users access to different trading markets like cryptocurrencies, forex, CFDs, commodities, and stocks. These markets have huge potential and high trading volume. According to IMARC impactful insights, the global foreign exchange (FX) market was valued at $ 753.2 Billion in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the utility token that offers Tradecurve holders benefits like governance rights, staking rewards, and discounts on fees, TCRV has been primed to benefit from the growth of the platform. In addition to the 50% rally, experts foresee the price of the token increasing by as much as 100x when the platform hits the global market. Currently, TCRV is valued at $0.015 per token, presenting a promising investment opportunity for investors looking to expand their market portfolio and grow their assets.</p>
