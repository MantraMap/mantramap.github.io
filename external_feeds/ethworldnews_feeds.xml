<ul><li>The U.S. Justice Department is reportedly probing Binance for potential violation of sanctions imposed on Russia. </li><li>The DoJ’s national security division is investigating the exchange’s officials to determine if sanctions were evaded. </li><li>The exchange is already facing a criminal investigation over alleged illegal activities including money laundering. </li></ul>



<p>The United States Department of Justice is reportedly probing the world’s largest crypto exchange for potential violation of sanctions imposed on Russia in light of the conflict in Ukraine. The purpose of the investigation is to determine if Binance Holdings Ltd. was illegally used to allow Russians to evade U.S. sanctions and move money through the crypto platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance Officials Under Scrutiny By DoJ</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the Justice Department’s national security division is investigating Binance to see if the crypto exchange complied with the sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Five people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the exchange’s officials are under scrutiny as part of the ongoing probe into the company’s conduct. </p>



<p>While the Justice Department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, Binance told Bloomberg that the company was in full compliance with all U.S. and international financial sanctions. The exchange added that it has enforced industry leading know your customer (KYC) protocols in addition to a zero-tolerance policy for double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In 2021, Binance launched an initiative to completely overhaul its corporate governance structure, including bringing in a world-class bench of seasoned executives to fundamentally change how Binance operates globally.” </p><cite>statement from Binance</cite></blockquote>



<p>A person close to the investigation revealed that as of now there is no indication that the Department of Justice is preparing to agree to a settlement with the crypto exchange. However, not all probes lead to the filing of formal charges. The latest probe adds to an existing criminal and regulatory investigation into the exchange over its conduct. The news comes barely a day after Reuters <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-reuters-accounts-terrorism-link/">reported</a> that the exchange was entertaining accounts with links to terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State. </p>

<ul><li>Binance has responded to a report from Reuters which claimed that the exchange entertained accounts linked to terror outfits.</li><li>Reuter recently reported that Israel had seized 190 Binance accounts linked to terrorist outfits like the Islamic State.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange called out Reuters for deliberately leaving out critical facts to fit their narrative.</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has taken issue with a recent report published by Reuters. In a response posted earlier today, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-changpeng-zhao-banking-crypto-btc/">Binance</a> accused the mainstream media firm of engaging in narrative journalism by way of selective reporting regarding the crypto exchange’s compliance policies to fit their narrative. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance: Reuters Is Deliberately Leaving Out Critical Facts</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-seized-binance-crypto-accounts-thwart-islamic-state-document-shows-2023-05-04/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> published a report on May 4, 2023, which revealed that Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) had confiscated two Binance accounts in January this year. As per documents on NBCTF’s official website, the accounts were affiliated with the Islamic State and were seized to “thwart the activity” of the Islamic State and prevent it from furthering its terror-related goals. Reuters further reported that the Israeli agency had seized around 190 Binance accounts since 2021, dozens of which were owned by Palestinian firms linked to the Islamist Hamas group.</p>



<p>According to Reuters, almost all of the 190 accounts seized by Israeli authorities since 2021 were owned by three currency exchange outfits based in Palestine. All three have reportedly been designated as terrorist organizations by Israel due to their role in transferring funds by the Hamas group. Al Mutahadun For Exchange, Dubai Company for Exchange, and Al Wefaq Co. For Exchange, the three Palestinian firms were reportedly behind more than 80 Binance accounts that held over $137,000.</p>



<p>In response to the Reuters article, Binance shared its side of the case in a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/our-response-to-reuters-1363137884256691497" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> earlier today. The crypto exchange accused Reuters of “deliberately leaving out critical facts to fit their narrative.” The firm took particular issue with the allegations made against its compliance team, which reportedly consists of 750 members with backgrounds in regulatory agencies and law enforcement. </p>



<p>Binance claimed that no other crypto exchange or financial institution did more to keep bad actors away and restrict unethical conduct. The exchange argued that criminal enterprises don’t register on the platform using their real identities which makes it difficult to root them out.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Almost half of our compliance team are involved in sanctions control work such as anti-money laundering, name screening, Know Your Customer (KYC) onboarding, and on-chain monitoring.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>The crypto exchange stated that it was constantly working with law enforcement agencies around the world to make the platform safer and limit the access of bad actors. To make its case for legal compliance, the exchange revealed that it had already facilitated the seizure of more than $1 billion following requests by law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Do Kwon could face 40 years in prison if prosecuted and found guilty by a court in his home country of South Korea.</li><li>Media reports confirmed that authorities in South Korea and the United States are contending over extradition rights after Montenegrin police arrested the Terraform Labs founder.</li><li>An investigator who has led the probe into how Terraform Labs collapsed opined that prosecuting Kwon in South Korea is &#8220;more efficient&#8221;.</li></ul>



<p>Media reports <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-prosecutor-calls-for-crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-to-face-charges-in-home-country-639f5515" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-prosecutor-calls-for-crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-to-face-charges-in-home-country-639f5515" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that authorities in South Korea and the United States are contending for the right to extradite Do Kwon after Montenegrin police arrested the Terraform Labs founder in March.</p>



<p>Kwon&#8217;s extradition has been a talking point since his <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-do-kwon-arrested-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-do-kwon-arrested-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrest in March</a>. Montenegrin police seized the fugitive as he attempted to fly to Dubai using fake travel papers. U.S. authorities hope to prosecute the former Terraform investor for defrauding American investors who held LUNA and UST, two tokens designed by the founder and other employees. </p>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission already <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwons-lawyers-sec-lawsuit-dismissed/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwons-lawyers-sec-lawsuit-dismissed/" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> Kwon with fraud and violations of securities laws though he tried to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-sec-dig-do-kwon-terra-and-lfg-files/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-sec-dig-do-kwon-terra-and-lfg-files/" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow down regulators with a court motion</a>.</p>



<h2>Best Jurisdiction To Prosecute Do Kwon</h2>



<p>Dan Sung-han who led South Korean efforts to uncover the factors behind Terra&#8217;s collapse, believes extraditing him to his native country would be the &#8220;more efficient&#8221; way to prosecute Do Kwon and deliver justice to Terra&#8217;s victims who lost at least $40 billion last May. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice. We’ve collected a large swath of evidence pertaining to the TerraUSD case overall, much of which is information that cannot be easily obtained in the U.S.</p></blockquote>



<p>&#8220;I believe the U.S. is willing to cooperate&#8221;, the South Korean investigator said, speaking to America&#8217;s request for Do Kwon&#8217;s extradition. </p>



<p>Montenegrin Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic said, &#8220;We are ready to make the extradition to the country which is looking for him&#8221;.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>New York Attorney General Letitia James is pushing to empower the State&#8217;s Department of Financial Services with the authority to implement stricter crypto rules.</li><li>AG James&#8217;s proposed regulations would compel crypto firms to reimburse fraud victims and bar crypto asset creators from running digital asset platforms.</li><li>The bill marks another crypto crackdown from the New York AG&#8217;s office after lawsuits against CoinEx, Kucoin, and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky.</li></ul>



<p>The office of the New York Attorney General is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/new-york-ag-proposes-landmark-crypto-law-citing-dysfunction" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/new-york-ag-proposes-landmark-crypto-law-citing-dysfunction" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">attempting</a> to rein in the crypto industry with a bill meant to introduce stricter crypto rules and improve oversight capacity from the state&#8217;s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).</p>



<p>Under the bill proposed by New York AG Letitia James, exchanges must reimburse users who fall victim to fraud. The so-called &#8220;nation-leading&#8221; crypto rules also ban developers of cryptocurrencies from operating digital asset exchanges and businesses. AG James argued that these crypto rules could mitigate conflicts of interest.</p>



<p>Crypto companies would also undergo independent and public auditing to strengthen trust and ensure compliance. The bill would also criminalize lending out customers&#8217; digital assets. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We&#8217;re proposing commonsense measures to protect investors and end the fraud and dysfunction that have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency. Banks and other financial services are regulated. The cryptocurrency industry must be too.</p></blockquote>



<p>To achieve this, AG James&#8217; bill would beef up regulatory authority commanded by New York&#8217;s Department of Financial Services. The NYDFS already launched a series of enforcement actions against crypto players in the State of New York.</p>

<h2>Crypto Rules Proposed After New York Crypto Crackdown</h2>



<p>New York&#8217;s DFS and AG James have gone after crypto businesses for alleged regulatory violations in recent months. In a lawsuit against crypto exchange Kucoin, the regulator argued that crypto&#8217;s largest altcoin Ether (ETH) meets securities requirements and should be regulated. </p>



<p>AG James also sued CoinEx and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-mashinsky-sued-fraud-ny/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-mashinsky-sued-fraud-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Mashinsky</a>, the former CEO of Celsius. New York is one of several states cracking down on crypto businesses across the U.S. The state&#8217;s financial regulator struck at <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-binance-stablecoin-paxos-busd/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-binance-stablecoin-paxos-busd/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance-branded stablecoin BUSD and its issuer Paxos</a>. </p>



<p>In Illinois, Coinbase was accused of violating Biometric privacy laws as watchdogs chase crypto entities toward off-shore jurisdictions. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Etherscan data showed the average cost of Ethereum transactions rose as high as $15 on May 4, a 1-year high.</li><li>Gas fees on L2 networks also skyrocketed, particularly on chains built using zero-knowledge proofs like Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era.</li><li>Crypto participants believe the memecoin renaissance led by PEPE coin is the main reason behind expensive transaction costs on crypto&#8217;s largest altcoin blockchain.</li></ul>



<p>Gas fees on Ethereum <a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">flew</a> to their highest level since 2022 in the middle of a memecoin renaissance championed by the &#8220;Pepe the frog&#8221; themed altcoin, PEPE. </p>



<p>The cost of sending transactions rose as high as $15 on May 4, its highest point in over a year. Gas fees had previously stayed at lower levels in the months after Terra crashed and the crypto markets nosedived. </p>

<h2>PEPE Trading Propels Ethereum Gas Fees</h2>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem is no stranger to memecoin mania as tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have drawn speculative traders before. It&#8217;s unclear whether the PEPE token will last as long as these OG memecoins after hitting a $1 billion market cap, a topic that Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-list-floki-floki-and-pepe-pepe-in-the-innovation-zone-f68a3bc6eb014ed9bacf1d6c71dc1134?ref=AZTKZ9XS&amp;utm_source=BinanceTwitter&amp;utm_medium=GlobalSocial&amp;utm_campaign=GlobalSocial" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-list-floki-floki-and-pepe-pepe-in-the-innovation-zone-f68a3bc6eb014ed9bacf1d6c71dc1134?ref=AZTKZ9XS&amp;utm_source=BinanceTwitter&amp;utm_medium=GlobalSocial&amp;utm_campaign=GlobalSocial" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weighed</a> in on after listing PEPE for spot trading today.</p>



<p>Binance paused PEPE deposits shortly after citing technical difficulties. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">#Binance</a> has postponed the listing of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FLOKI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">$FLOKI</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">$PEPE</a> until May 5, 2023, 18:00 UTC.<br><br>Trading will start at 18:00 UTC, as opposed to the original start time of May 5, 16:00 UTC.<br><br>Please note that deposits for both PEPE and FLOKI will resume at 15:30 UTC.<a href="https://t.co/pJieemoTyP" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/pJieemoTyP</a></p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1654489172768325636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 5, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>There are also indicators pointing to PEPE as the reason behind Ethereum&#8217;s pricey gas fees. PEPE holders traded $150 million in volume over the past 24 hours on the decentralized exchange Uniswap.</p>



<p>Increased interest in PEPE pushed the token into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The token sits at #42 according to CoinMarketCap. <a href="https://pro.nansen.ai/hot-contracts" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://pro.nansen.ai/hot-contracts" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nansen</a> data clocked several copycat tokens and increased trading activity tied to other memecoins on ETH&#8217;s chain. </p>



<h2>High Gas Fees Rock L2 Networks Too</h2>



<p>Layer 2 networks designed to reduce transaction costs experienced high gas fees as network demand shot up. Fees on layer 2 scaling solutions built using zero-knowledge proofs like Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era were significantly higher than L2&#8217;s designed using optimistic rollups. </p>



<p>Per L2 Fees data, the cost of a single transaction on zk rollups ranged between $2 to $11, rising as high as $30. </p>

<ul><li>Voyager Digital may start distributing its remaining assets to creditors in the next few weeks.&nbsp;</li><li>The announcement was made by Voyager’s Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors.&nbsp;</li><li>The direct distribution plan for customers was unveiled last month after Binance US pulled out from a deal to acquire Voyager.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The stranded customers of Voyager Digital got some relief earlier today after the bankrupt crypto lender indicated that it may start repaying them in the next few weeks. Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors recently took to Twitter to announce that the company was deliberating the final liquidation procedures. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Voyager Digital To File Final Liquidation Procedures On May 5</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1654203057591267329" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> thread from Voyager’s Unsecured Creditors Committee, the bankrupt crypto lender and the committee is in the process of finalizing the liquidation procedures. The committee reminded its Twitter community that any plan for liquidating the firm’s assets are required to be filed before they come into effect. The liquidation procedure will lay out the details of the method by which creditors will receive the distribution from Voyager. </p>



<p>Once the liquidation procedures are filed parties will have ten days to express any objection to the plan. In the event that any party objects, the bankruptcy court will schedule a hearing to consider the objection before allowing the crypto lender to go ahead with the liquidation. In case no objections are filed, Voyager Digital’s distribution plan will come into effect. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors. We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.”</p><cite>Committee of Unsecured Creditors</cite></blockquote>



<p>Voyager Digital’s (VYGVQ) share price gained more than 6% following the latest development. The firm initially <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-us-ends-1-billion-voyager-deal/">announced</a> its plan to distribute the remaining assets to creditors and stranded customers on April 25, 2023, after Binance US terminated the $1 billion deal to acquire Voyager&#8217;s assets. At the time, the bankrupt crypto lender stated that the Chapter 11 plan allows for the direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers using its online platform. </p>

<ul><li>The Bankruptcy Court of Delaware has authorized bankrupt crypto exchange FTX to sell its LedgerX.</li><li>The derivatives trading platform is set to be sold to M7 Holdings LLC for $50 Million.</li><li>The sale is part of a broader effort from the bankrupt exchange’s management to repay its creditors.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware has approved the sale of FTX’s non-bankrupt crypto derivatives exchange LedgerX. The bankruptcy court’s approval comes less than two weeks after the defunct crypto exchange announced that it had reached an agreement with an affiliate of Miami International Holdings to sell LedgerX in a multi-million dollar deal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>FTX Will Sell LedgerX To M7 Holdings</strong></h2>



<p>The bankruptcy hearing for the proposed sale was streamed live on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoXrCSg4uHc" rel="nofollow noopener">Youtube</a> earlier today. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey gave FTX the green light to sell its LedgerX business to M7 Holdings LLC for $50 million. The buyer is an affiliate of Miami International Holdings, which owns and operates several exchanges, including the Bermuda Stock Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange. </p>



<p>FTX <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-announces-ledgerx-sale-for-50-million/">announced</a> on April 25, 2023, that it had entered into an interest purchase agreement with M7 Holdings LLC to offload LedgerX. The agreement to offload the crypto derivatives exchange came after a comprehensive sale process that saw participation from multiple bidders including popular crypto exchange OKX. At the time, FTX stated that the deal with M7 was subject to approval from the Delaware bankruptcy court as well as the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. </p>



<p>LedgerX’s sale is part of a broader effort from the bankrupt crypto exchange’s new management to raise funds in order to repay its creditors and customers. Speaking on the initial agreement with M7 Holdings, FTX CEO John Ray stated, “We are pleased to reach this agreement with MIH, which is an example of our continuing efforts to monetize assets to deliver recoveries to stakeholders.”</p>

<ul><li>A WallStreetBets’ insider who rugged WSB Coin has returned the funds he took from the project.&nbsp;</li><li>$WSB lost more than 90% earlier today after insiders dumped more than half a million dollars worth of the memecoin.&nbsp;</li><li>The insider responsible for the rug pull has since made contact with the WallStreetBets team to make WSB investors whole.&nbsp;</li><li>$WSB gained more than 150% after the insider agreed to return the funds.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The WallStreetBets insider accused of pulling the rug from under WSB Coin investors has returned the funds he took from the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/doge-up-6-twitter-crypto-trading-etoro/">memecoin</a> project. In a rather interesting turn of events, WSB Coin’s zjz.eth who was accused of rugging the project, took to <a href="https://twitter.com/zjzWSB/status/1654089362563366915" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to defend his actions and instead accuse WallStreetBets’ Twitter operator WSBMod of gaining undue profits through secret airdrops of the memecoin. Following hours of back and forth, the stolen funds were returned to the project, leading to a 155% hike in WSB Coin’s price. </p>



<h2><strong>WallStreetBets Insider Returns 332 ETH To WSB Coin</strong></h2>



<p>The controversy started earlier today after the recently launched WSB Coin lost more than 90% of its value. Popular On-chain sleuth ZachXBT <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1653937194388664322" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that a member of WallStreetBets (zjz.eth) had dumped more than $600,000 worth of WSB from the project’s marketing funds that he was holding for safekeeping. The insider then proceeded to collude with the moderator of the WallStreetBets subreddit (OIP), to drain the project’s multi-sig treasury.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WSBMod called out the project’s insiders on Twitter and demanded they get in touch to facilitate the return of the stolen funds. The moderator shared the identities of both insiders on Twitter and threatened to contact the FBI over their rug pull. zjz.eth soon took to Twitter to reveal that he was seeking a return mechanism for the eth he had taken. He further accused WSBMod of draining WSB Coin through secret airdrops of over $25,000. He alleged that the memecoin was designed to enrich the moderator. However, he was called out by the community for dumping the stolen WSBs and netting over half a million dollars in the process. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was ordered to respond to a complaint from crypto exchange Coinbase within the next 10 days, a court ruled on Wednesday.</li><li>Coinbase filed a lawsuit to force the watchdog to clarify how it interprets and applies securities laws to the cryptocurrency industry.</li><li>The ruling is the latest development in an ongoing showdown between crypto businesses in the U.S. and financial watchdogs.</li></ul>



<p>On Wednesday, a U.S. court <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1653898889311948800?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1653898889311948800?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ordered</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission to answer a lawsuit regarding how the watchdog applies federal laws to the nascent digital asset industry and cryptocurrencies. </p>



<p>The complaint in question was filed by crypto exchange Coinbase after the SEC issued a Wells notice to the company. Indeed, the regulator alleged a &#8220;possible violation of securities laws&#8221; by Coinbase. </p>



<p>In response, Coinbase sued the regulator for opting to reign in the crypto industry through enforcement actions rather than providing sufficient guidance and compliance guidelines.</p>



<p>Coinbase cited a petition from 2022 that asked the watchdog to provide official rules for the crypto industry. Gary Gensler&#8217;s commission is yet to address the petition. Instead, the regulator has cracked down on crypto entities like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for allegedly breaking existing securities laws. </p>



<p>The regulator now has 10 days to respond to Coinbase&#8217;s suit following the court ruling on Wednesday. Also, the crypto exchange may submit a reply seven days after the regulator files. </p>



<h2>SEC Enforcement Actions </h2>



<p>The watchdog has continuously maintained that the crypto industry remains a threat to U.S. financial stability. While likening crypto to the &#8220;wild wild west&#8221; and insisting that existing securities laws provide sufficient oversight, the regulator has also undertaken several enforcement actions against crypto businesses. </p>



<p>Crypto proponents speculated that the latest round of enforcement actions is part of a called &#8220;operation chokepoint 2.0&#8221;, a joint initiative between state and federal regulators meant to boot out crypto and digital asset staking services from America. </p>



<p>Coinbase was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> of violating securities laws in March. Crypto trust company Paxos also received a Wells notice from the watchdog over alleged violations. Binance was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-nydfs-against-binance-deal-voyager/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-nydfs-against-binance-deal-voyager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embroiled</a> in a legal sparring match with the commission over a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager assets. </p>



<p>Some businesses like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/pierce-lambasts-sec-kraken-decision/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/pierce-lambasts-sec-kraken-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a> were fined and forced to completely shut down some of their on-shore services. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Coinbase users will no longer be able to borrow up to $1 million using Bitcoin as collateral.</li><li>The crypto exchange plans to shut down its Borrow program starting May 10, 2023, due to insufficient demand for the product.</li><li>Wednesday&#8217;s decision also comes amid a tussle between U.S. regulators and crypto businesses like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase users will no longer be able to access cash loans using Bitcoin as collateral as the company moves to unwind its Borrow product. </p>



<p>According to an <a href="https://twitter.com/hyper_deflation/status/1653793658913554439?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/hyper_deflation/status/1653793658913554439?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">email</a> sent to users on Wednesday, the crypto exchange plans to shut down its Borrow program starting May 10 this year. The move will not affect outstanding loans but users will not have the option to take new loans. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Beginning May 10, 2023, customers will no longer be able to take out new loans with Coinbase Borrow. There is no impact on your outstanding loans and there is no action required at this time. You will continue to have access to your loan history and the full Borrow dashboard.</p></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase U.S. users were introduced to the Borrow product back in August 2020. The program did not launch till over a year later in November 2021, giving users an option to access cash without liquidating their BTC holdings. </p>



<p>Users in some U.S. states were allowed to borrow as much as $1 million against their Bitcoin balances at an 8.7% annual percentage rate (APR). </p>



<p>Interest in the product has seemingly declined in the two years since its launch. A Coinbase spokesperson noted that the reduced interest was the main reason behind closing the borrow program. </p>



<p>&#8220;We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we’re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most,&#8221; said the spokesperson. </p>



<h2>Coinbase Embroiled In Battle With U.S. Regulators</h2>



<p>Although regulatory concerns were not the main reason for Wednesday&#8217;s decision, the move comes amid tension between U.S. regulators like the SEC and crypto businesses. </p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Well notice to Coinbase in March over alleged securities law violations. In response, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> the SEC to strong Gary Gensler&#8217;s commission into clarifying regulations for the crypto industry. </p>



<p>Coinbase is also looking toward offshore options, The company recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> a derivatives exchange domiciled in Bermuda. </p>
