During the first three months of 2023, the central bank stated that it would proceed with the continuation of the Turkish <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/">CBDC&#8217;s</a> &#8220;limited, closed-circuit pilot tests.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Turkey&#8217;s CBDC Pilot</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/Announcements/Press+Releases/2022/ANO2022-55" rel="nofollow">statement</a> released by the financial institution, the bank will continue to undertake tests for legitimate architectural setups established in areas such as the use of &#8220;distributed ledger technologies in payment systems and the integration of these technologies&#8221; with instant payment systems.</p>

<p>As the central bank discloses more advanced phases of the ongoing pilot research, the firm wants to expand the Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform to include a select number of banks as well as financial technology businesses.</p>
<p>The Turkish bank further states that studies on the economic and legal framework of the Digital Turkish Lira, in addition to its technological requirements, will be given priority for the entirety of 2023.</p>
<h2>Global CBDC Push</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, a report was published by the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a> of the United States that provided a detailed analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of CBDCs. And, on the other hand, the European Central Bank is also investigating various <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency">options</a> for incorporating decentralized ledger technology into their already existing payment settlement systems.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, Japan, Indonesia and <a href="https://coingape.com/digital-rupee-wipe-out-black-money-claims-rbi-official/">India</a> are some of the other countries aiming toward the adoption of digital currencies backed by their central banks.</p>

The contribution from SBF amounted to more than 95% of the organization&#8217;s earnings for that year, and it also covered 94% of the organization&#8217;s expenses.</p>
<h2>Buying Political Affluence?</h2>
<p>Bankman-Fried has been said to donate around $760,000 to the Campaign Legal Center&#8217;s (CLC) action fund in 2021, according to a spokesperson for the organization. This commitment of $760,000 was one of two significant pledges that SBF made to CLC Action, the other being a gift of $300,000 in the year 2022.</p>
<p>As per information gathered from the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-funded-90-of-campaign-legal-centers-political-arm-2022-12?IR=T" rel="nofollow">report</a>,  the extravagant spending of Bankman-Fried helped sustain CLC Action, which describes itself as a &#8220;social welfare organization&#8221;, as well as the tax-exempted philanthropic arm of the ethics watchdog group.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Just-In: Sam Bankman-Fried Used $546 Mn From Alameda Research To Buy Robinhood Shares" href="https://coingape.com/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-used-546-alameda-research-buy-robinhood-shares/" rel="bookmark">Sam Bankman-Fried Used $546 Mn From Alameda Research To Buy Robinhood Shares</a></em></p>
<p>When asked about returning SBF&#8217;s contributions after the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX&#8217;s</a> bankruptcy proceedings, Brendan Quinn, a spokesman for the Washington group, stated that:</p>
<blockquote><p>$2.5 million has been put into a separate account until [further] instructions are received from bankruptcy courts. We cannot change the past, but we can change the future.</p></blockquote>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Numerous Donations</h2>
<p>Since Bankman-Fried was indicted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a>) for defrauding investors in his now-defunct FTX <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>, there has been an upsurge in the scrutiny of his donations and contributions.</p>
<p>His contributions went towards a wide variety of causes in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>, including political campaigns, financing media organizations, and other charitable causes. Additionally, the disgraced crypto founder is currently being investigated for multiple infractions of laws governing the campaign finance guidelines.</p>
<p>On December 29, news broke that the 30-year-old <a href="https://coingape.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-enter-plea-next-week-in-ftx-fraud-case/">SBF has agreed to enter a plea</a> to the criminal allegations at a Manhattan federal court on January 3, 2023, before the U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan.</p>

The similarities are such that, it contradicts the industry&#8217;s narrative and claims about virtual assets being an alternative source of value due to the inflation-hedging benefits that are supposedly associated with them.</p>
<h2>Crypto Frameworks In Development</h2>
<p>India announced on Thursday that during its current presidency of the G20, it would prioritize the development of a framework for global regulation of unbacked crypto assets, stablecoins, and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralized finance (DeFI)</a>. Additionally, India stated that it would also explore the &#8220;possibility of prohibition,&#8221; which could be a significant setback for the industry as it continues to develop.</p>
<p>&#8220;To address potential financial stability risks and protect investors, it is important to arrive at a common approach to crypto assets&#8221;, the Financial Stability Report released by RBI said on Thursday.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Popular Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) Bull Run In 2023" href="https://coingape.com/popular-crypto-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-btc-bull-run-in-2023/" rel="bookmark">Popular Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) Bull Run In 2023</a></em></p>
<p>The RBI issued a warning echoing the sentiments of other central banks across the world, saying that <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">crypto</a> might &#8220;divert financing away from traditional finance&#8221; with a larger effect on the actual economy, if it becomes increasingly integrated into the mainstream financial system.</p>
<h2>India To Ban Crypto?</h2>
<p>In the context of developing a regulatory framework for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>, the report stated that various options were being considered internationally. One such way was to subject them to the same regulation applicable to traditional financial intermediaries and exchanges. However, they were also open to prohibiting the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a> completely. The information gathered from the report stated that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Another option is to prohibit crypto assets, since their real life use cases are next to negligible and the challenge is that different countries have different legal systems and individual rights vis-à-vis state powers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most outspoken critics of the cryptocurrency business is the Indian central bank. Last week, <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-rbi-chief-reaffirm-crypto-ban-warn-financial-crisis/">RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das issued a warning</a>, stating that unless private cryptocurrencies are outlawed, the next financial crisis will be caused by their use.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency, according to Das, has its roots in the notion that it subverts or undermines the current financial system. &#8220;They don&#8217;t believe in the central bank&#8221; or a controlled financial system, Das said. He further added that he believes the crypto market should be disallowed and said, &#8220;I’m yet to hear a good argument about what public purpose it serves.”</p>

Recently, the ownership structure of Shiba Inu has reached a crucial turning point. This occurs as a result of the percentage of long-term SHIB owners having crossed the crucial 60% mark; which suggests that the majority of network holders are serious investors.</p>
<h2>SHIB&#8217;s Holding Composition</h2>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB" rel="nofollow">research</a> conducted by the crypto analysis platform IntoTheBlock, long-term investors which make up the majority of Shiba Inu holders have held their SHIB tokens for at least a period of one year. According to the available data, SHIB has made extraordinary strides in this direction since the beginning of the year; the percentage of owners has increased from a meager 1% to a stunning 60% at that time.</p>

<p>The data further reveals the holder composition where 60% of SHIB holders have maintained their tokens for more than a year, 36% have held them for less than a year, and 4% have held them for less than a month.</p>
<h2>Massive Whale Activity</h2>
<p>As a result of the unfavorable market conditions that have persisted since the beginning of 2022, massive whale accumulation has been observed in regard to the SHIB <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<p>According to data provided by WhaleStats, the utility of the Shiba Inu among whales has increased significantly in the previous twenty-four hours. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">meme cryptocurrency</a> has now entered the list of top 10 tokens purchased among the 2000 largest <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> whales in the market. Earlier, SHIB was also among the top smart contracts that got maximum engagement by the top 100 whales, as per the data.</p>

<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Rally?</h2>
<p>In October of 2021, the price of SHIB skyrocketed to a new all-time high. However, due to the unfavorable macro climate and the instabilities in the domestic crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin&#8217;s</a> value dropped by more than 70%. The Shiba Inu community is looking forward to the next year for a relief rally for the SHIB&#8217;s price following the strong fundamental developments.</p>
<p>As things stand, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is presently being traded at $0.000008029. This represents a decrease of 0.34% on the day, with a further decline of 3% during the week as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bear trap refers to a technical pattern that forms when the price action of a stock or any other financial instrument incorrectly signals a reversal from an uptrend to downtrend. In simpler terms, the prices may move higher in a broad-based incline. It then encounters significant fundamental resistance or change, prompting bears to open short positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the cryptocurrency market, a bear trap generally involves several traders who have a significant amount of combined cryptocurrency holdings. They can plan to sell a large amount of a particular coin at the same time. This produces a false indication that other market participants think that a price correction is taking place. They sell their own holdings in response, which drives prices down even further. Once the bear trap is released, the group buys back their assets at a lower price. This leads to the value of that coin rebounding, allowing the trap setters to make a profit. </span></p>
<h2><b>How does a Bear Trap work in the Crypto Market? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More often than not, novice traders get caught out by price volatility when trading in the cryptocurrency market. While it is always recommended to stay for the long term to ride out such volatility, price reversals can confuse even the most experienced traders. This makes it crucial for traders to identify the signs of a false reversal. Increased volatility can lure short-term traders to time the markets, resulting in losses for the majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For markets which trend upwards, a sudden downward price move can increase volatility, forcing market participants to go short on the underlying asset or liquidate long-term holdings. This form of market manipulation is called a bear trap in crypto. The main aim of this move is to deceive bearish participants into believing that it is an indication of the start of a downtrend. It is often followed by a sharp resumption of the previous uptrend. </span></p>
<h2><b>How do groups of traders take advantage of a crypto bear trap?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups of traders coordinate with each other for the collective selling of a particular token. This causes the token’s price to fall, influencing other retail participants to believe that the uptrend is over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, many investors tend to sell their holdings which decreases the price even further. The influential trader groups then proceed to buy back the sold quantities of tokens when they break below the previously held lows. This triggers a sharp upward move that entraps bearish bets. As a result, the trader group profits from the difference by selling at a higher price and buying them back at a lower price. </span></p>
<h2><b>How can traders identify and avoid a bear trap? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders can use trading indicators and technical analysis tools such as volume indicators, Fibonacci levels and RSI to identify a bear trap. They can use these tools to confirm whether the trend reversal after consistent upward price movement is genuine or false. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that there isn’t a bear trap, traders must check whether the downtrend is driven by high-trading volumes. Some of the most tell-tale signs of a bear trap forming include a combination of factors such as the retracement of the price below a key support level, low volumes and failure to close below critical Fibonacci levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto investors who have a low-risk appetite should avoid trading during price reversals which are abrupt and unsubstantiated. They should check whether the price and volume action confirms a trend reversal below any important support level. For traders, it makes sense to hold their cryptos and avoid selling unless the price has breached the stop-loss level or the initial purchase price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every trader must understand how crypto react to crowd psychology, sentiments and news if they want to avoid a bear trap. This is easier said than done, due to a large amount of volatility in the crypto market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders who want to profit can get into a put option and avoid becoming a short-seller or long-seller. A put option avoids the exposure to unlimited risk if the crypto resumes its upward trend, which is not the case with short-selling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By getting into a put option, a trader limits his/her losses to the premium paid. It prevents it from affecting the long crypto position being held from before. In the case of long-term investors, it is better to stay away from trading during a bear trap. </span></p>
<h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>
<p><b>Can a bear trap be traded by bullish or bearish traders? </b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since a bear trap comprises both a downward and upward move, both bearish and bullish traders can trade it using different strategies with potential outcomes. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>How does a bear trap differ from a bull trap? </b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bull trap is the opposite of a bear trap. Here, traders assume a downward trend is reversing and beginning to take long positions, only to realize later that the market has resumed its downward trend. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Can traders recover from a bear trap? </b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a trader gets caught in a bear trap, his/her PnL will get hurt significantly since these traps are quick moves which provide no chances to recover.  To conserve their PnL, traders must understand the underlying market movement during a bear trap to identify it. </span><b></b></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Helium Network is the first to introduce a wireless network to mine crypto. In this network, nodes act as hotspot devices, allowing HNT mining.</span></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto mining has been a lucrative way of earning passive income from the comfort of your home. It all started with Bitcoin and gradually reached several other mineable cryptos like Dogecoin, Ethereum Classic, and even Monero. The main reason behind the growth of crypto mining is its convenience and the fact that it doesn’t require significant investment capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, many mineable cryptos came under the spotlight for being highly profitable, but none of them lasted for long. But in 2019, a new blockchain-based cryptocurrency called Helium network entered the market that created a hype around Helium miner.</span></p>
<h2><b>The technology behind Helium mining</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helium Network has been offering a decentralized wireless infrastructure to mine HNT tokens and make profits. For this reason, helium mining has grown considerably since the day it first came out. The early adopters of helium mining fared better than most and set a record by gaining a substantial amount of HNT, the reward for mining Helium network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project exists as a scattered network (hence called the Helium network) where each and every node is a hotspot with LoRaWAN capability. LoRaWAN (long-range WAN) is one of the fastest-growing Internet of Things connections that is basically a network protocol using long-range radio modulation technology. Both the Helium network and HNT tokens are based on the proof-of-coverage algorithm, which makes it a decentralized Internet of Things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a significantly large LoRaWAN network, Helium works by connecting data across the internet using physical devices, which are helium miners. In a way, Helium network has adopted a practical approach to the IoT, which was limited to making homes and logistics innovative.</span></p>
<h2><b>Helium network: what is it?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand how a helium miner works, it is essential to discuss what a helium network is in itself. The crypto community knows Helium Miner as the first-ever decentralized wireless network that allows HNT mining. The helium network is made up of long-range wireless hotspots that provide access to these miners that are part of the IoT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helium network is an intelligent use case of wireless technology that eliminates connectivity-related issues in Wi-Fi. It is possible because the helium network has a much wider range of connections at its disposal. A centralized hub (mostly routers) isn’t necessary in this case because every device can connect with others nearby automatically and directly.</span></p>
<h2><b>How does a Helium miner work?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before helium, crypto miners relied on costly mining rigs that reduced their ROI considerably. But after the Helium network emerged, it allowed people to mine HNT tokens using a very different means, i.e., with a wireless device called a hotspot. Helium miners receive HNT tokens as a mining reward for providing coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Helium network is essentially decentralized in nature, it allows people to set up hotspots (helium miners). Proof-of-Coverage is still a novel algorithm that the Helium blockchain uses for confirming the location of hotspots and their network coverage. Most people use the Helium Network Explorer tool for viewing data connected to POC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio waves replace CPUs and ASICs in the case of helium mining. Helium hotspots prepare long-range wireless coverage for miners using LoRaWAN transmitters. Earning HNT as mining rewards takes place in two ways:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When miners transfer data to other devices available on the Helium network.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a hotspot nearby often run proof-of-coverage challenges</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to mine HNT, you need a special device, which is a LoRaWAN transmitter. But the most important factor that determines how much a helium miner earns is their geo-location. Gaining an antenna is crucial to increasing your mining rewards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be able to mine HNT profitably, one has to keep in mind that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 3 types of helium miners or wireless plug-and-play hotspots used for mining HNT: full hotspots, light hotspots, and data-only hotspots.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning HNT tokens is possible by expanding Helium&#8217;s network coverage, which comes down to transferring more data in return for more rewards.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Pros and cons of Helium mining</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being wireless allows the helium miner to use radio technologies and mint HNT tokens. Its proof-of-coverage model makes it easy for anyone to set it up and start mining to receive rewards. It is a truly disruptive piece of technology where anyone interested can start mining HNT cryptos and generate a stable passive income. It requires no capital investment except for joining a helium hotspot to start mining.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One cannot cash out their earnings in HNT tokens directly from the Helium wallet they own. To do this, you will need to transfer the HNT to a compatible exchange. Furthermore, the total earnings depend on too many random factors, including the antenna’s location, height, etc.</span></p>
<h2><b>Is it worth mining Helium?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we think of whether it is worth mining Helium or not, we must consider its profitability now vs. then. In January 2021, the total number of Helium hotspots was 14,000, but these figures have grown to 900,000 while the rewards shared are the same. Each day, new miners enter the helium network, which significantly reduces the total mining rewards and therefore the profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this scenario, it seems like the early adopters of the Helium network have gotten the most rewards by mining HNT. But all newcomers must ensure that their mining efforts are well rewarded by the network.</span></p>
<h2><b>The future of Helium mining</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helium mining does not guarantee profits in any way, but that is the crypto industry for you. Everything in this market is highly volatile and subject to change in an unpredictable way. While it is true that helium miners present an innovative way to generate passive income, depending on how earnings change from person to person, we are yet to see any changes in this project.</span></p>
<p><b>FAQs</b></p>
<p><b>How can I earn more HNT via mining if I live in a densely populated area?</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helium mining profitability depends on network coverage and data transfer, and both of these things are decided by the helium miner. You can tweak the miner you have installed to get better results.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>What if I am situated too far away from Helium hotspots?</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The farther you are from a Helium hotspot, the weaker the connection gets, which affects the amount of HNT earned. Too much distance would make you unable to communicate with other available hotspots.</span></p></blockquote>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning of the great economies that exist even to this day, we have witnessed a sort of deterioration. Though it usually goes unnoticed at first, the tightening of financial conditions could give rise to an event on a global scale very quickly. That global-scale event is what we call a global recession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of those burning topics that needs your attention. The goal behind understanding what a global recession is is to know how to avert it or, if anything, survive it. A global recession is a severe financial crisis experienced all over the globe that comes with devastating consequences.</span></p>
<h2><b>The true meaning of global recession</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no fixed definition of &#8220;global recession&#8221; that one can refer to in times of need. But despite the absence of a practical definition, the true meaning of &#8220;global recession&#8221; can be derived from its effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most prominently, the synchronized financial disruption all around the globe indicates what a global recession’s true meaning is. The effects of the global recession are not only limited to the financial sector; they also damage the economic conditions in many countries at once. It is said that the global recession of 2009 was the deepest and most synchronized of all its predecessors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, we can say that the global recession is the harbinger of a period of extreme stress in terms of global financial markets. It affects not only the banking system but also leaves the housing system in a dilapidated state. The aftermath of a global recession includes banks incurring great losses, millions of people losing their jobs, and numerous companies declaring bankruptcy.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Causes</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, we have understood that there is a pattern to global recessions. After experiencing a total of 5 of the worst global recessions, economists have concluded that this is a sign of the next global recession’s arrival. This arrival happens after two successive quarters of negative economic growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how do we avert it? If only we knew the main causes behind global recession, there’s a chance that we could avoid it. Here are a few well-known and well-researched causes of the global recession.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Any significant disasters like war</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wars and other disasters put immense pressure on the global economy. Fuel and food shortages are common occurrences in war-torn countries. But wars damage the economy and cause permanent fragmentation of finances that ultimately affect the world’s economy. This is why economists and financial experts hold war-like disasters responsible for it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Decline in per capita GDP</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decline of per capita GDP is a serious concern that might be a foreboding of a global recession, as per the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF has stated that the condition could get worse if there is extreme risk aversion. This is why the decline in annual per capita GDP serves as a warning sign.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Rising unemployment rate and layoffs</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s a nation slipping into recession, that could turn into a global problem quickly, and their unemployment rate would spike. A rise in unemployment could eventually have a negative implication and turn out to be reduced productivity. In this situation, progress slows down and a global-scale recession seems probable.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Retardation of purchasing power</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great economies around the world exist because of the purchasing power possessed by their currencies. However, if this purchasing power dwindles as a result of unchecked inflation, this can frequently lead to a recession. A global recession is a severe economic downturn in which high living costs, high interest rates, and dwindling credit ratings all work together to reduce a currency&#8217;s purchasing power.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Decreasing confidence in investments</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global consumer confidence being at its lowest levels could result in a general decrease in confidence in investments. As a result, market analysts are detecting signs of a sharp decline in global financial markets that are devoid of investors. All of this could contribute to hastening a recession because the lack of investor confidence breaks the economy and causes consumers to delay their spending.</span></p>
<h2><b>How to survive a it</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After discussing the true nature of it and understanding some well-known factors, a situation like that appears to be nothing short of a nightmare. Let’s take a look at the following tips to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://hbr.org/2019/05/how-to-survive-a-recession-and-thrive-afterward" rel="nofollow">survive</a> this situation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tech investments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We talked about how investing confidence slows down the economy. But during a recession, if you could play it safe then the situation can be handled. Experts advise investing in technology because demand for tech skills returns once the market situation improves.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Avoiding layoffs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While layoffs become necessary during trying times, it is certainly not the only solution. There are other operational improvements that could cut costs much more than laying off a number of employees that results in hurting morale and slowing down productivity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Track the downturn</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Before the situation turns chaotic, businesses and government need to deleverage at the earliest signs of a downturn. To do that, one needs debt financial management because companies with high debts are highly vulnerable during a recession.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>What is inflation?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measurement of price changes of individual products over time is very easy to measure. However, human needs aren’t limited to just one or two products. They need a diversified set of products and services to lead a comfortable life. These can include products such as fuel, metal, and food grains, services such as labor, entertainment, and healthcare, and utilities such as transportation and electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation refers to the quantitative measure of the rate at which the average price level of a set of selected goods and services increases over a period of time. In other words, it is the increase in the general level of prices where a unit of currency buys less than it did in previous periods. It is the rate at which the general level of goods and services is rising and the purchasing power of a currency is falling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formula for calculating it is expressed as:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation = [{Price(year 1) – Price 2(year 2)}/Price (year 1)] *100</span></p>
<h2><b>What causes inflation?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crucial cause of inflation is an increase in the supply of money. However, this scenario can play out in different ways in different economies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what the scenario is – money ends up losing its purchasing power. Therefore, the causes of inflation can be divided into three types – demand-pull, cost-push, and built-in.</span></p>
<h3><b>Demand-Pull Effect</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation due to the demand-pull effect occurs when the supply of money and credit increases and stimulates the overall demand for goods and services to increase more than the economy’s production capacity. As a result, prices rise due to the increasing demand. If people have more money, it results in positive consumer sentiment. This results in higher spending, which further increases prices. As a result, a demand-supply gap is seen with higher demand but less flexible supply.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cost-Push Effect</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation due to the cost-push effect occurs when prices increase through the production process inputs. The cost of intermediate goods tends to rise when the added supply of money and credit is fed into a commodity or other asset markets. This is more likely when there is a negative economic shock to the supply of key commodities. This leads to higher costs for a finished product or service which increases consumer prices.</span></p>
<h3><b>Built-in Inflation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built-in inflation refers to the idea that people are expecting current inflation rates to continue in the future. Due to the price of goods and services rising, people may expect it to continue at a similar rate. In such circumstances, workers may demand more wages to maintain their standard of living.</span></p>
<h2><b>Effects of Inflation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It affects almost everyone in some way or the other, be it consumers, investors, or the overall economy. Here are some of the most common effects on any economy.</span></p>
<h3><b>Decreases purchasing power</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An overall increase in prices over time can decrease the purchasing power of consumers as a fixed amount of money will afford less consumption. Consumers lose purchasing power when it is at 2% or 4%.</span></p>
<h3><b>Effects the poor disproportionately</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People in the low-income bracket tend to spend a higher proportion of their income on necessities and, thus, have less of a cushion against the loss of purchasing power. However, those who receive Social Security benefits and other federal transfer payments receive inflation protection in the form of cost of living adjustments.</span></p>
<h3><b>Increases interest rates</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments and central banks everywhere need to keep inflation in check, generally by using monetary policy. Inflation threatens to exceed a central bank’s target rate. Under such circumstances, policymakers can raise the minimum interest rate which increases borrowing costs as it constrains the money supply.  As a result, inflation and interest rates move in the same direction.</span></p>
<h3><b>Lower debt service costs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New borrowers face higher interest rates when it increases. However, those with fixed-rate mortgages and other types of loans tend to benefit from repaying them in inflated money. This lowers their debt service costs after an adjustment.</span></p>
<h2><b>4 Easy Examples</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help readers understand this concept better, we have come up with four examples.</span></p>
<p><b>Example #1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say a consumer can purchase a burger for $2 in 2022. The yearly inflation rate is 10%. Theoretically, this means that under 10% inflation, the same burger will cost 10% more, ie. $2.20.</span></p>
<p><b>Example #2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A historical example of would be Hungary, which in 1946 experienced the worst case scenario for its currency at the time. The inflation rate was well over 200% a day and prices doubled almost every 15 hours. In such cases, the only solution for a country is to abandon the existing currency and introduce a new one – which is exactly what Hungary did.</span></p>
<p><b>Example #3</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say that the price of a book was $20 in 2016 (year 1) and the price increased to $20.50 the next year.  Thus by using the formula, the annual inflation is 2.5 %.</span></p>
<p><b>Example #4</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say consumer prices went up by 8.5% over the last 12 months since the end of March 2022. Thus, a carton of eggs which was worth $3 is now $3.26.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the aforementioned, we have gathered the significance of inflation in any economy.</span></p>
<h2><b>FAQs</b></h2>
<p><b>Why can&#8217;t the target inflation rate be less than 2%?</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The target rate isn’t set close to zero as it may cause people to stop buying things if they think prices are going down.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>How does inflation differ from deflation?</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In inflation, prices of goods and services increase while the purchasing power of people decreases. In deflation, prices of goods and services decrease.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Is inflation a good or bad thing?</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it reaches high rates, it can be harmful to an economy. However, too little of it can cause the economy to weaken.</span></p></blockquote>

Ethereum price also fell and bounced from $1,185. The uncertainty continues to prevail in the crypto market, with total crypto market volume falling nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-michael-saylors-microstrategy-buys-2395-bitcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MicroStrategy buying Bitcoin</a> recently has confused the market.</p>
<h2>Where Is the Bottom For Bitcoin Price?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price is currently trading at $16,591, as per <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinMarketCap</a>. The 24-hour low and high are $16,497 and $16,768, respectively. The BTC price risks falling to $15,600 if it fails to hold above the support level until the month&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-breaking-17000-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Price Breaking $17,000 Resistance Is Crucial, Here’s Why</a></p>
<p>Several on-chain indicators such as MVRV, NUPL, Puell Multiple, and SOPR indicate that the BTC price has already reached the undervalued area. These cycle indicators help analyze the overall phase. However, it is difficult to predict a correct buying time.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133528" style="width: 746px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-133528" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29173450/Bitcoin-Price-Bottom.webp" alt="Bitcoin Price Bottom" width="746" height="332" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-133528" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Bottom. Source: CryptoQuant</figcaption></figure>
<p>UTXOs in Profit and Loss on-chain data indicate an exact level where Bitcoin can be considered undervalued. Bitcoin price trend shifts when the UTXOs in Profit and Loss indicators cross. Historically, the Bitcoin floor was formed during the past three BTC Halvings when the UTXOs in Profit and Loss indicators were crossed.</p>
<p>While the indicators are moving close, they aren&#8217;t showing a possibility of a cross. Thus, Bitcoin is not undervalued yet or bottomed out. Traders must keep an eye on a cross in the future to buy Bitcoin at the correct time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is likely to fall further, and spot hedging and downtrend trading are required.</p>

<p>Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1608384060543336448" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">believes</a> BTC price can fall to $16,200 if it fails to bounce from $16,400. Whereas, analyst CryptoCapo thinks the entire crypto market looks bad and top <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altcoins</a> can fall another 50%.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, MicroStrategy reported that it has increased its Bitcoin holdings by 2,500 BTCs and the total holding is 132,500 BTCs now. In fact, experts such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes strongly believes that the Bitcoin price can hit $100K by the 2023 end or early 2024.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Price Looks Better Than BTC</h2>
<p>Ethereum price is currently trading at $1,200. The 24-hour low and high are $1,185 and $1,20, respectively. Thus, the ETH price is moving strongly as compared to Bitcoin as it didn&#8217;t hit the $1,170 support level.</p>
<p>Crypto analysts believe anything above $1,170 would be a good price to buy for the long term. Ethereum price closing above the support will be bullish for Ethereum in 2023. Almost <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-whales-sold-close-to-1-million-eth-in-december-2022-more-fall-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.24 million addresses hold</a> around 2.27 million <span class="link-complex-target">ETH at the $1,170 support level.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A seed phrase is a 24-word series of words that acts as the password to your crypto wallet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your seed phrase is the only backup to your crypto assets and gives you access to them </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One must keep the seed phrase safely in order to get access to your crypto wallet</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Introduction </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major distinction that makes the crypto space accessible to users is its self-sovereignty. This allows you as a user to have access to your crypto without the requirement to prove your identity or rely on a bank. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum use blockchain technology to store and secure the crypto you are investing in by using a P2P network of computers worldwide. The blockchain uses certain codes that generates passwords algorithmically that can only the holder can access. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed phrase or recovery phrase is considered the last line of defense when it comes to providing security for crypto users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recovery phrase or seed phrase can help you lose access to the crypto wallet in an emergency. While many tend to confuse private keys with seed phrases, they are completely different and serve different purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dig deeper to learn more about the recovery phase and its importance in the crypto space.</span></p>
<h2><b>Seed/recovery phrase: what is it exactly? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A seed or recovery phrase is basically a cluster of random words that your crypto wallet generates algorithmically at the time of setting it up and act as a backup. Your seed phrase helps you to regain access to your funds as well as your cryptocurrency wallet in case of emergencies. For example, if you have lost your phone and have a mobile wallet, you can use the seed phrase to get complete access to your crypto. These seed phrases are intercompatible, which makes it easier to switch wallets as well, apart from recreating your wallet. It thus goes without saying how important it is to secure your funds in crypto.</span></p>
<h2><b>How does a seed phrase work in crypto?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it is termed a “wallet,” your cryptos aren’t actually stored within it and instead exist as data on the blockchain. This implies that even if access to your wallet gets interrupted somehow, the funds are still recorded safely on the digital ledger of the blockchain. Upon creating a crypto wallet a seed phase is automatically generated that represents a long series of random numbers that your wallet uses to create private keys for making transactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed phrase is a string of simple words like “stereo,” “fabric,” or “opera” instead of numeric passwords. The reason behind this is simply that humans are better at remembering a series of words than a string of numbers. However, instead of relying on your memory, it is always a better idea to secure your seed phrase, as losing it can lead you to lose access to your wallet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every seed phrase is generated from a list of 2,048 simple English words known as the BIP39 standard that most of the leading crypto wallets use. Whether it is a hardware wallet or a software one, recovery phrases are generated each time a crypto wallet is created. Each seed phase is 12 or 24 words long and unique to the wallet it was created in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “seed” in a seed phrase refers to the strings of random digits that can be used to generate your private master key, which can in turn be used to generate your private keys as well. While the recovery phrase might seem to be simply a set of words, it basically translates into a lengthy series of data that appears similar to a cryptocurrency address. </span></p>
<h2><b>What does it look like?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of a numeric series, each recovery phrase is generated from the BIP-39 word list, a list of 2,048 English words that were adopted after the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 in 2013. This proposal established a benchmark for a “deterministic wallet” that most crypto wallets follow. Here, one seed phrase will be charged to control all the private keys that are held in the wallet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the words are randomized, it is important to remember that the recovery phrase is not in any old order. To get access to your wallet, you must put the words in the same order in which they were generated. Because the order itself is part of the phrase.</span></p>
<h2><b>Private Key vs. Seed phrase</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private keys and seed phrases can often be confused, as both are sequenced and created by new crypto wallets. Since both are crucial to the safety of the wallet, they need protection to prevent access by intruders. Despite the similarities, they differ in their functionalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private keys come from the string of numbers representing your recovery phrase. It enables users to send or spend cryptocurrencies. Seed phrases are the master key that gives you access to your wallet along with the private keys as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can imagine your private key as your ATM’s PIN combination. It is a password that helps in facilitating fund withdrawals or approving a purchase while using a debit card. On the other hand, a seed phrase is more likely the master key to your entire savings, and whoever possesses it can have the ability to have complete control over the account. </span></p>
<h2><b>How to safely store a seed phrase?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since this is the “key” to your crypto wallet, it should be a secret at all costs. The 24-word seed phrase is the main backup of your assets in crypto that anyone can access if compromised. For this reason, most people use different strategies to securely store their seed phrases. Some of them are as follows.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can secure it by splitting it between safe deposit boxes in different locations. However, this strategy might not be convenient for many. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engraving your recovery phrase on durable metals like stainless steel can help. Many people simply write it down and have multiple copies safely kept in different locations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also use a hardware wallet that is legitimate and trustworthy. However, make sure not to keep them in any smartphone application or computer. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Final words</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no denying the importance of seed phrases to your crypto assets. That is why it becomes critical to store them in a highly secure place. You should always stay away from making a digital copy of your seed phrase. Instead, one should take foolproof steps to secure them before someone steals it. Remember, the recovery of your crypto wallet solely depends on these.</span></p>
<h3><b>FAQs</b></h3>
<p><b>Is it possible to recover a wallet with a seed phrase?</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can securely restore your wallet on another device by simply entering a 12-word or 24-word phrase into a new wallet. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>What happens when you lose the seed phrase?</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you lose the seed phrase, it means you will lose access to your crypto wallet as well as your funds.</span></p></blockquote>

However, its associated digital technologies set the stage for the nation&#8217;s interest in taking the lead in the so-called &#8220;<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaverse</a></strong> world&#8221; early in 2022.</p>
<p>The funds will lay the groundwork for the country to be among the top five nations in metaverse development by 2026. According to South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, technology is a national priority. Park Jin, Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated that the country is poised to become a metaverse powerhouse.</p>
<h2>South Korea: Metaverse Love</h2>
<p>South Korean companies and local governments have piled into virtual world projects. However, following the lead of the government. Seoul&#8217;s virtual replica is being built as part of a project to provide citizens with digital civil services. Similar metaverse initiatives have been announced by city governments in Busan, Seongnam, and Gumi.</p>
<p>Eastern Gyeongbuk Province mentioned itself as South Korea&#8217;s &#8220;metaverse capital.&#8221; However, it announced a five-year initiative to invest $13.8 million in the local metaverse economy. It is estimated that this will add $780 million to the region&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>South Korean companies reportedly trail only the United States in the number of metaverses. However, related patent applications for <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/future-rulers-of-the-metaverse-top-5-augmented-reality-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual reality and augmented reality</a></strong> filed since 2016. Although, accounting for 19% of the 7,760 applications filed. The United States and South Korea account for 75% of the total.</p>
<h3>Gamers are not happy</h3>
<p>The Science Ministry of South Korea defines the metaverse as a space where virtual and physical reality converges. However, permitting people, to interact and create economic, social, and cultural value.</p>
<p>South Korean <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/crypto-metaverse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online game</a></strong> developers are not happy with this statement. They said according to existing laws for game developers they will not regulate metaverse.</p>
<p>This reaction came as South Korea&#8217;s video gaming industry remains bound by strict rules. However, both of which local experts say that are outdated and unfair, while the discussion on the virtual world and game debate rages on in South Korea. According to Miso Information Technology, the country should continue to invest in the virtual world.</p>

However, this report suggests where Solana Blockchain can head from this mega crisis.</p>
<h2>Solana TVL down by 97%</h2>
<p>Solana entered the year 2022 with a trading price of around $172. Meanwhile, SOL price has dropped by over 94% on year to date (YTD) basis to trade at an average price of $9.43, at the press time. Its market cap has shrunk to stand at $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>As per the data, the Solana network&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/tvl-total-value-locked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Total value locked (TVL)</a> is down by 97%. The recent collapse of SBF’s FTX and Alameda has dragged the token into the max turbulence zone. These two have been the biggest backers of SOL. Coingape reported that Arthur Hayes, co founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange called<a href="https://coingape.com/solana-news-arthur-hayes-calls-solana-a-shitcoin-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Solana a Shitcoin.</a></p>
<p>Solana even laid out the details of its exposure to FTX. It mentioned $1 million cash, 3.24 million shares of FTX, and 3.42 FTT tokens. While it also held 134.54 million SRM tokens which are stuck on the FTX token. However, 50.5 million SOL were vesting with Alameda Research.</p>
<h2>Where does Solana Blockchain Go From Here?</h2>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/blockworksres/status/1608178016869576706" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Report</a> mentioned that Serum and Solana’s CLOB was a critical move for the DeFi infrastructure. However, the Serum program update key wasn’t controlled by the SRM DAO. This directly implies that the hacker who stole assets from FTX can viciously update Serum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Solana community rushed to the situation, and in order to cure the damage it created Openbook dex. OpenBook is claimed to be a DAO where all the development is sourced from people who refused to abandon the network. However, the DAO is using SRM tokens but a new token might be made ahead.</p>
<p>The most important question here stands where will Solana can go from here? As per reports, Firedancer, an independent validator for Solana Blockchain, built on Jump will be scaling throughput, sustainability and efficiency.</p>
<p>While Anatoly Yakovenko, Co-founder of Solana Labs flashed his Saga phone at a recent event. While Openbook is on a mission of saving Solana DeFi. However, Aurory, a Solana-based blockchain gaming project will make one of the first Web3 games on a mobile device.</p>

The assured exclusive ownership of NFTs is one of its primary distinguishing characteristics. An NFT is essentially a unique token of which copying or faking cannot take place.</p>
<p>However, the NFT holders&#8217; ability to use their assets is severely constraining by this exclusivity. Due to this, industry innovators have pushed the limits of what is feasible for NFTs. Thus, opening up possibilities for fractional ownership.</p>
<p>Crypto investors can own a portion of a large pie due to fractionalization. There are little to no risks. The idea is comparable to having stock in a corporation. Small- and mid-tier investors can now own NFTs instead of merely whales with large bank balances.</p>
<h2>A Fractional NFT: What Is It?</h2>
<p>An NFT divided into smaller fractions is known as a fractional NFT. This arrangement enables many parties to claim ownership of various portions of the same NFT. A smart contract that creates a predetermined number of tokens tied to the indivisible original fractionalizes the NFT. These fractional tokens, which can be sold or exchanged on secondary marketplaces, grant each holder a portion of ownership in an NFT.</p>
<p>NFTs, also known as non-fungible tokens, are indivisible ERC-721 tokens produced by a smart contract on the Ethereum network. The tokens are the ideal medium for individualized intellectual property tracing since they are indivisible and impossible to duplicate.</p>
<p>Thanks to numerous NFT project auctions that broke records, NFT asset values soared in 2021. These virtual assets range widely and include virtual real estate, in-game objects, digital art, and many more.</p>

<h2>Gaining Access to F-NFT Ownership</h2>
<p>NFTs are becoming a more and more well-liked asset class. Some collections have grown to be so valuable that purchasing a single NFT has become unaffordable. The NFT collections that are worthwhile to collect can still be fairly expensive, even though not all of them have achieved the fame of Beeple&#8217;s artwork or the cartoon ape avatars from Bored Ape Yacht Club. Additionally, the fact that NFTs are unique tokens makes it challenging to purchase them on cryptocurrency markets due to a lack of liquidity.</p>
<p>Fractionalization is a potential solution to all of these issues because of the high hurdles to entry. The accessibility of NFT can increase for investors by dividing financial resources into smaller portions. Due to the increased market liquidity, this is advantageous for both investors and NFTs in general. Fractional NFTs flood the market with many inexpensive tokens that offer a share of well-known NFTs.</p>
<p>In essence, purchasers with restricted financial resources can purchase fractional NFTs for a small portion of the market value. Due to this, different investors can each acquire a portion of the same asset.</p>
<h3>Assets with Fractionation</h3>
<p>The concept of asset ownership in portions is not new. The idea has been successfully implied to a wide range of physical assets, including stock, designer goods, and luxury assets like yachts and private planes, in industries ranging from real estate to fashion.</p>

<p>Fractionalization is a popular method for groups of people to affordably buy holiday homes in the real estate sector. Owners who purchase fractional ownership of property receive a deed that represents their part, unlike timeshare owners who are only guaranteed a certain period at a property each year.</p>
<p>All the gains and losses that come with owning property are assumed by fractional owners. Depending on how much of the asset each co-owner owns, they each receive a proportionate share of the revenue, usage rights, and access to the shared property. The value of individual shares will increase if the vacation home&#8217;s overall worth increases over a decade. Of course, that also implies that if the value of the property declines, the value of the shares will do the same.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the Process of NFT Fractionalization?</h2>
<p>An NFT is essentially just a token that adheres to the ERC-721 standard for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>. The NFT must first be locked in a smart contract, which is just a blockchain-based program that is programmed to run once certain criteria are satisfied before it can be fractionalized.</p>
<p>Following the NFT owner&#8217;s instructions, the smart contract divides the ERC-721 token into various fractions in the form of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> tokens. The owner specifies how many ERC-20 tokens will be produced, their price, their metadata, and other characteristics. The NFT is represented by each fraction, or ERC-20 token, as having a portion of ownership. The fractions are then offered for sale for a predetermined amount of time or until they are all gone for a set price.</p>

<p>The fact that NFTs and fractionalized NFTs aren&#8217;t merely available on the Ethereum <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> should not be overlooked. Any blockchain network that supports smart contracts and NFTs can implement fractionalization. Alternative networks that support smart contracts that enable the generation and transfer of NFTs are Polygon (MATIC), <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/">Cardano (ADA)</a>, and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/solana-sol/">Solana (SOL)</a>. Fast transaction speeds and gas fee-free usage are other advantages of these networks.</p>
<h2>What Distinguishes F-NFTs from Traditional NFTs?</h2>
<p>Fractionalized NFTs, also known as F-NFTs, are fractions or percentage ownership of a whole NFT. An NFT is a whole, whereas F-NFTs are merely fractions of the entire, hence there is a clear distinction between the two.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to note that the fractionalization process can be undone, turning F-NFTs back into whole NFTs. A buyout option is often included in the smart contract that fractionalizes an NFT, enabling an F-NFT investor to acquire all of the fractions and unlock the original NFT.</p>
<p>By returning a predetermined quantity of ERC-20 tokens from a collection to the smart contract, an F-NFT holder can start the buyout option. This will start a buyback auction that will last for a predetermined amount of time. This provides time for the other F-NFT holders to decide. The fractions are automatically returned to the smart contract and the buyer acquires complete ownership of the NFT if the buyout is successful during that time.</p>
<h2>Why Is the Need for Fractional NFTs?</h2>
<p>F-NFTs are required for the following three primary reasons:</p>
<p>Democratization: Smaller investors may not be able to participate in some NFTs due to their expensive costs. A costly NFT can be made more affordable and available to a wider group of investors by fractionalizing it. It&#8217;s also crucial to remember that when the price of an NFT rises, all of its fractions&#8217; values rise accordingly. The worth of all the fractions will decrease as well if their value abruptly plummets, which happens frequently in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>Price discovery: Fractionalized NFTs can offer mechanisms for determining the price at which a specific NFT is valued. The open market is where the fractionalized ERC-20 tokens are traded, thus their prices can help give.</p>
<p>More liquidity: One of the most distinguishing characteristics of NFTs is that they are unique tokens that cannot be duplicated or divided. Due to their rarity, few wealthy investors have access to NFTs, especially those that are valued. Due to the ease with which ERC-20 tokens may be exchanged in secondary marketplaces, F-NFTs alleviate this lack of liquidity. Numerous investors might be more eager to snap up fractions of an NFT right away at a lower price than they would be to wait weeks or months for one NFT to sell, so addressing market liquidity difficulties.</p>
<h2>Are They a Smart Investment?</h2>
<p>Without a question, fractional NFTs are a wise investment. They are improving inclusiveness and participation in the burgeoning NFT market while also assisting in releasing liquidity for NFTs. They increase the NFT market&#8217;s new potential by democratizing, increasing liquidity, and establishing prices.</p>
<p>However, fractionalized NFTs are not risk-free because they experience the same problems that affect NFTs in general, including publicity rights, contracts, and intellectual property rights. F-NFTs are more likely to create concerns with financial regulators because their creation could be considered unauthorized initial coin offerings, even though the sale and acquisition of full NFTs as digital collectibles may not pose issues with securities laws (ICOs).</p>
<p>Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner, expressed concern that the organization would see fractional NFTs as securities at the Security Token Summit 2021. However, no official legal or regulatory standards on NFTs have yet been published by the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission).</a></p>
<p>The laws governing NFTs and F-NFTs will change as the market for these assets expands. Investors and business owners in NFT-related initiatives should be aware of any potential legal difficulties for the time being.</p>
