<h2>U.S. Regulators Warn About Crypto Risks</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a joint statement on crypto risks to banking organizations Tuesday.</p>
<p>They explained that events in the past year showed &#8220;significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector.&#8221; The regulators named many risks, including fraud and scams, legal uncertainties, inaccurate or misleading representations by crypto companies, significant volatility in crypto markets, run risks, and contagion risks. &#8220;It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,&#8221; the joint statement emphasizes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the agencies&#8217; current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued, stored, or transferred on an open, public, and/or decentralized network, or similar system is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices,&#8221; the statement continues, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The agencies have significant safety and soundness concerns with business models that are concentrated in crypto-asset-related activities or have concentrated exposures to the crypto-asset sector.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC noted that they &#8220;will continue to closely monitor crypto-asset-related exposures of banking organizations,&#8221; concluding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Banking organizations should ensure appropriate risk management, including board oversight, policies, procedures, risk assessments, controls, gates and guardrails, and monitoring, to effectively identify and manage risks.</p></blockquote>

The new FTX chief&#8217;s &#8220;continued lack of diligence when making public statements concerning the Commission is disappointing,&#8221; the Bahamian regulator stressed.</strong></p>
<h2>Bahamas Regulator and FTX Disagree on the Value of Seized Crypto Assets</h2>
<p>The Securities Commission of the Bahamas issued a statement Monday to &#8220;correct material misstatements&#8221; made by the new FTX CEO, John J. Ray III, regarding the value of the cryptocurrencies it seized from FTX. Ray represents U.S. FTX debtors in the crypto exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy filing (Chapter 11 Debtors).</p>
<p>The Bahamian regulator explained that on Dec. 30, 2022, FTX and Ray &#8220;publicly challenged the Commission&#8217;s calculations&#8221; of the value of the crypto assets transferred to its digital wallets on Nov. 12. According to the Commission, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamas-seizes-digital-assets-worth-over-3-5-billion-from-collapsed-crypto-exchange-ftx/">over $3.5 billion</a> in cryptocurrencies were seized from FTX. However, Ray argued that the value of the digital assets transferred on that date was actually about $296 million.</p>
<p>In its Monday statement, the Commission said that the U.S. FTX debtors&#8217; calculations &#8220;were based on incomplete information,&#8221; asserting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Chapter 11 Debtors chose not to utilize their ability to request information from the joint provisional liquidators pursuant to a court order of the Supreme Court of the Bahamas… The U.S. debtors&#8217; continued lack of diligence when making public statements concerning the Commission is disappointing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bahamas regulator alleged that the new FTX CEO made false statements regarding the Commission in a court filing on Dec. 12, 2022, &#8220;without evidence,&#8221; and again under oath on Dec. 13 before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services. The regulator specifically mentioned the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-government-officials-allegedly-asked-sbf-to-mint-millions-of-dollars-in-new-tokens-amid-the-ftx-collapse/">accusation</a> that it asked former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to mint &#8220;a substantial amount of new tokens&#8221; during the crypto exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy process.</p>

<p>The Commission added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Ray has not once reached out to the Commission to discuss any of his concerns before airing them publicly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ray was appointed the new FTX CEO and its chief restructuring officer when Bankman-Fried stepped down as the crypto exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed for bankruptcy</a>. Ray, who also led Enron during the energy giant&#8217;s bankruptcy, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ceo-says-ftx-is-the-worst-case-of-corporate-failure-with-untrustworthy-financial-data-and-unacceptable-practices/">said</a> about FTX in November: &#8220;Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Securities Commission of the Bahamas further revealed that the new FTX CEO has not responded to its Dec. 7 letter in which the Bahamian regulator offered &#8220;cooperation with Chapter 11 Debtors.&#8221;</p>

Celsius owes Core Scientific approximately $7.8 million for energy and hosting costs, as the crypto lender has been unable to make regular payments as outlined in the hosting contract.</strong></p>
<h2>Celsius Owes Core Scientific $7.8 Million for Energy and Hosting Costs</h2>
<p>Lawyers representing bankrupt bitcoin mining operation Core Scientific have told the court that crypto lender Celsius has not made payments on its mining machine hosting costs since July. The story was first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-03/crypto-miner-core-scientific-to-shutter-over-37-000-celsius-rigs?leadSource=uverify%20wall">reported</a> by Bloomberg, and Celsius reportedly owes approximately $7.8 million for costs associated with the machines.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing Core Scientific state that shutting down the bitcoin mining devices would save the firm a substantial amount of funds, and the company could potentially make $2 million per month if it rents out the hosting seats to another mining operation.</p>
<p>Core Scientific was one of the largest bitcoin miners in the industry, and <a href="https://investors.corescientific.com/investors/news/default.aspx">records</a> from Nov. 7, 2022, show that 41% of the company&#8217;s servers are for customers paying for hosting services. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 21, 2022, but it noted that the firm&#8217;s machines will continue to operate in order to pay down debt.</p>

<p>Chris Koenig, a lawyer for Celsius, has stated that the crypto lender has agreed to shut down the 37,000 bitcoin mining rigs and end the hosting contract. &#8220;We&#8217;re not seeking to make a dollar off of Core after today,&#8221; Koenig remarked. The news follows Celsius looking to extend customer claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Celsius is preparing to file a motion later this week requesting an extension of the bar date, which is the deadline to file a claim, from Jan. 3, 2023, until early February,&#8221; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork/status/1608285816933031936?s=20&amp;t=zVg0CZNF1kD-M04aHpPS1A">said</a> on Twitter. &#8220;Our goal is to provide account holders with additional time to file any proofs of claim.&#8221; Celsius further stated that the motion will be forwarded at a hearing on Jan. 10, 2023.</p>

New York’s financial regulator said compliance problems were detected and the exchange’s anti-money laundering controls were inadequate from 2020 through 2021.</strong></p>
<h2>New York Regulator Fines Coinbase $100 Million for Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Issues</h2>
<p>The crypto exchange and custodial firm Coinbase (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/COIN:NASDAQ">COIN</a>) has agreed to a $100 million settlement with New York’s top financial regulator NYDFS for failing to enact proper anti-money laundering controls in 2020 and 2021. Coinbase has agreed to pay a $50 million fine and another $50 million will go towards applying necessary anti-money laundering (AML) background checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coinbase lacked sufficient personnel, resources, and tools needed to keep up with these alerts, and backlogs rapidly grew to unmanageable levels,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/ea20230104_coinbase.pdf">consent order</a> signed by superintendent Adrienne Harris details. &#8220;By the end of 2021, Coinbase had a backlog of unreviewed transaction monitoring alerts grew to more than 100,000 (many of which were months old), and the backlog of customers requiring enhanced due diligence exceeded 14,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>The compliance investigation started in 2020 and the alleged lack of background check controls started in 2018. Coinbase agreed at the time to hire an independent examiner to make sure AML and know-your-customer (KYC) guidelines were followed. However, compliance problems persisted and the New York regulator decided to take action in 2021. “We have been very outspoken about illicit financing concerns in the space. It is why our framework holds crypto companies to the same standard as for banks,” superintendent Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/04/business/coinbase-settlement-anti-money-laundering.html">said</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase’s stock COIN jumped on the news rather than decline, as shares increased by 6.74% on Wednesday. Coinbase also <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/Coinbase-and-NYDFS-reach-agreement-to-resolve-compliance-investigation">responded</a> to the settlement on its blog and it noted that it has “committed to $50 million in compliance program investments over the next two years.” The exchange’s blog post message about the NYDFS settlement continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>We view this resolution as a critical step in our commitment to continuous improvement, our engagement with key regulators, and our push for greater compliance in the crypto space – for ourselves and others.</p></blockquote>

When asked about the visits, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told the press the meetings involved discussions about “pandemic prevention.”</strong></p>
<h2>Senior White House Staff Met With Former Billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried to Discuss &#8216;Crypto Industry&#8217; and &#8216;Pandemic Prevention&#8217;</h2>
<p>The disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), who is currently charged with eight counts of financial fraud and misconduct, met with the senior White House adviser Steve Richetti three times. SBF also met with the White House deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed on one occasion as well. SBF <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-execs-gave-70-million-to-both-democrats-and-republicans-heading-into-the-2022-us-midterms/">donated</a> a great deal of money to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-suspects-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-donated-over-1-billion-to-support-democrats/">Democrat leaders</a> in the U.S., including $5.2 million in campaign donations to the current president Joe Biden.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-prosecutors-probe-democrats-over-donations-from-sam-bankman-fried/">reports</a>, several members of the U.S. Democratic Party and certain campaign committees are currently under investigation by federal prosecutors for donations associated with SBF. Just recently, during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7N30Ktx7l0">Dec. 13, 2022 press briefing</a>, a reporter asked White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre if the administration would return the funds.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m covered here by the Hatch Act,” Jean-Pierre remarked to the reporter. She further noted that there were limitations on what she could say to the press. ”Anything that&#8217;s connected to political contributions, from here I would have to refer you to the DNC,” Jean-Pierre added.</p>

<p>To start the new year, the White House held a <a href="https://youtu.be/fauPemGNvoA">press briefing on Jan. 3, 2023</a>, and Jean-Pierre was asked about the four meetings with SBF and senior Biden administration officials. Biden’s press secretary explained that the meetings were about gathering general knowledge about the crypto industry and pandemic prevention.</p>
<p>“Let me give you a few rundowns here. As we previously confirmed and as you know, I know you&#8217;re following this very closely, these meetings included Steve Richetti and Bruce Reed, the meetings focused on pandemic prevention related to Sam Bankman-Fried’s foundation,” Jean-Pierre said. “And general information on the cryptocurrency industry and crypto exchanges. Look, you know, the administration has been clear about the need for Congress to take action when we talk about addressing cryptocurrency.”</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre also discussed Biden’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-delivers-crypto-framework-to-biden-as-directed-in-executive-order/">focus</a> on the crypto industry and his recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-signs-executive-order-establishing-national-crypto-policy-across-6-key-priorities/">executive order</a> last March. “The president as you know released an executive order on this topic just last March. And the president released a framework for protecting consumers last fall and last November,” the press secretary continued. &#8220;Secretary Yellen renewed the administration’s call for Congress to take action. So as you know the White House regularly engages with officials from a range of industries and sectors including leaders in businesses like nonprofits.”</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Again this meeting with Sam Bankman-Fried was focused on pandemic prevention-related matters and cryptocurrency and crypto exchanges.</p></blockquote>
<p>The pandemic prevention commentary was a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=pandemic%20prevention&amp;src=typed_query">topical discussion</a> on social media after the Jan. 3 press briefing published on Tuesday. Jean-Pierre’s statements were mocked just like her Hatch Act statements two weeks prior. One individual who <a href="https://twitter.com/haralabob/status/1610379085875924992?s=20&amp;t=JGDRpAng4abT76Hv8UjsWA">joked</a> about Jean-Pierre’s SBF comments said that maybe the White House should “schedule a meeting with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort-expects-bitcoin-and-ethereum-to-be-substantially-higher-despite-ftx-collapse/">Jordan Belfort</a> (the Wolf of Wall Street) on vaccines next.”</p>

The move saw prices hit their highest point since mid-December, and comes as market sentiment has shifted in a bullish direction. Cardano was also in the green, as it hit a one-week high today.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) rose for a sixth straight session on Wednesday, as market momentum remains bullish.</p>
<p>SOL/USD surged to a high of $14.10 earlier in the day, less than a day after trading at a low of $11.83.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s rally saw the token climb to its highest point since December 15, when it last collided with a resistance level of $14.50.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, Wednesday&#x2019;s surge comes as SOL moved beyond a ceiling of 53.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 59.79, which is its strongest point since Nov. 6.</p>
<p>Bulls in solana will likely continue to attempt a breakout of a ceiling at $14.50 in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Another notable gainer on Wednesday was cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>), which climbed to a one-week high earlier today.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.2505 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD raced to a peak of $0.2668 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move saw the token collide with a long-term resistance level of $0.2660, hitting its highest level since December 27 in the process.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, this rally pushed the RSI to its own resistance of 47.00, which has resulted in earlier gains easing.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 46.75, with cardano trading at $0.2649 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve&#x2019;s meeting minutes for December.</p>
<p>The moving average of 10 days (red), and its 25-day (blue) counterpart have also neared in proximity, which could be catalyst for an upwards cross later in the week.</p>

In addition to the not guilty plea, SBF’s judge Lewis Kaplan granted the defendant’s request to keep the names of his $250 million bond signees redacted. </strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Pleads Not Guilty to Criminal Charges and Fights to Keep Bond Signees Anonymous in Court</h2>
<p>Disgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) said he’s not guilty of the eight charges against him when he attended his court hearing in front of judge Lewis Kaplan on Tuesday. When SBF’s entourage arrived outside the Manhatten courthouse, his SUV was swarmed by the press and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud-charges-in-new-york.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar">reports</a> say the crowd was so large “Bankman-Fried’s mother was unable to exit the vehicle.” SBF’s bodyguard and security team then escorted the former FTX executive into the courthouse.</p>

<p>Alongside pleading not guilty to the charges against him, SBF’s attorneys filed a motion in order to keep the names of the two signees who signed SBF’s $250 million bond sealed. The attorneys insisted that SBF’s parents were already dealing with risks from their son’s case and the legal team said it wants to make sure the bail bond’s guarantors don&#8217;t suffer the same fate. SBF’s bond was interesting because the former FTX executive didn&#8217;t have to pay any money at all. His parents had to secure the bond with their house in Palo Alto and four people co-signed the bond.</p>
<p>The deal is if SBF does not appear in court or if he breaks his bail conditions, his parent’s Palo Alto home could be on the hook, and the signees could be forced to cover the rest of the bond. Judge Lewis Kaplan approved the motion to keep the two signees names sealed even though there were filings opposing the sealing. Matthew Russell Lee from the Inner City Press <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1610369131244552194?s=20&amp;t=yVj5OuJB59BFnLAGNW-KHQ">said</a> that usually “co-signers&#8217; names and info, including income, are routinely made public in the SDNY Magistrates Court, for less privileged defendants.”</p>

<p>Russell Lee <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1610374942356393985?s=20&amp;t=yVj5OuJB59BFnLAGNW-KHQ">detailed</a> that the Inner City Press filed an opposition to the sealing and he also mentioned that judge Kaplan set a new bail condition for the defendant. SBF is now not allowed to access any funds associated with FTX or Alameda Research while on house arrest. “[U.S. prosecutors] didn&#8217;t ask for no Internet condition, as they ask for in some other cases,” Russell Lee said. After SBF’s not guilty plea, judge Kaplan scheduled the trial to tentatively begin on Oct. 2, 2023.</p>

Bitcoin was also higher, rising to an eight-day high.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rose to an eight-day high on Wednesday, as cryptocurrency markets climbed ahead of the latest FOMC minutes release.</p>
<p>Following a low of $16,622.37 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $16,886.14 earlier today.</p>
<p>The move saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> rise above a key resistance level of $16,800, which is typically the last hurdle preventing price from reaching $17,000.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, today&#x2019;s surge in price has sent bitcoin to its highest point since December 27, when it traded at $16,961.</p>
<p>Traders will likely attempt to move above $17,000 ahead of or directly after the release of the minutes report.</p>
<p>The rally comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moves above its own ceiling at 49.00, and is currently tracking at 50.37.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also surged in today&#x2019;s session, with prices climbing to a multi-week high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD rose to a peak of $1,253.12 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,207.49.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, ethereum broke out of a resistance level at $1,230, hitting its highest level since December 16 in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the surge came as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> broke out of its resistance level on the RSI at 50.00, and it is currently tracking at 55.73.</p>
<p>This shift in momentum comes as the 10-day (red) moving average neared an upwards crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Should this cross take place, we will likely see ethereum move above the $1,300 mark in the upcoming days.</p>

According to Israel Ololade, the head of product at Roqqu, the European Union license &#8220;aligns with the brand&#8217;s drive to become the number one blockchain and crypto company globally.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Adoption Lags Behind in Europe</h2>
<p>The Nigeria-based cryptocurrency exchange Roqqu was recently granted a European Union (EU) virtual currency license, enabling it to offer its services to users in 28 European countries, a statement released by the firm has said. The license allows Roqqu users, including non-Nigerians, to trade digital currencies as well as to participate in the non-fungible token (NFT) market.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the crypto exchange’s EU license means Roqqu is one of the first digital asset exchange platforms from Africa to expand into Europe. In a statement, the Nigerian crypto exchange also shared a few reasons which influenced its decision to seek a Eurozone license.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our research, we found that Europe needs to catch up in terms of its global average of cryptocurrency adoption. They crawl globally with an average of 27%. European crypto exchanges come with more complicated user interfaces and high fees, making it difficult for early traders to participate in crypto as much as they want,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin-make-global-commerce-easy-founder-of-nigerian-crypto-exchange/">interview</a> with Bitcoin.com News, the crypto exchange’s CEO Benjamin Eseoghene suggested the decision to expand into Europe was been influenced by users who asked Roqqu to consider making its services &#8220;available to their friends and family members who live and study abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel Ololade said the EU license &#8220;aligns with the brand&#8217;s drive to become the number one blockchain and crypto company globally.” In addition, Roqqu’s expansion into Europe opens a channel that allows Nigerians in the diaspora to seamlessly send remittances to family and friends in Nigeria, Ololade added.</p>

Dante Disparte, CSO of Circle, in an article published for the WEF, states that while 2022 has been a terrible year, the building blocks of the industry will continue to be &#8220;integral parts&#8221; of the modern economic toolkit.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">WEF Believes in Crypto&#8217;s Resilience</h2>
<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) believes that the disastrous year that 2022 represented for the cryptocurrency industry can lead to growth and recovery of the ecosystem. An <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/future-of-cryptocurrencies-davos2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> written by <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/authors/dante-disparte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dante Disparte</a>, published on WEF&#8217;s weforum.org, explains that while the recent downfall of FTX and the demise of the Terra blockchain affected millions of consumers in 2022 — with the market losing $2 trillion in that period — this has not changed the core of these technologies, which are currently being tested by financial institutions all over the world.</p>
<p>On this subject, Disparte explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the underlying technology of cryptography and blockchain is generalizable to all industries and coordinating activities (collectively the building blocks of Web3), experimentation at the core of financial services, among other sectors, continues unabated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Disparte cites JPMorgan as an example of this, being a company that publicly has pivoted from being clearly oppositional to crypto and blockchain, to adopting the tech in several of its experimental products and offering crypto to select customers.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Crypto and Internet</h2>
<p>Disparte harnesses a commonly used simile, comparing crypto with other ubiquitous tech like the internet and email, which have also been used for illegal and criminal purposes by bad actors. Putting the weight of the malevolent actions on the people using the tools, and not the tech itself, is key in this period for crypto, according to Disparte.</p>
<p>For the WEF, the best course of action to perpetuate crypto and blockchain is to &#8220;net out their harmful effects by placing technologies (like all tools) in the hands of responsible actors and encouraging their responsible use.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this sense, the author believes that crypto, no matter what, remains a protagonist in the financial world and that while regulation is indeed a necessity, countries able to provide it while maintaining a competitive approach will shape the future of the industry. Disparte concludes that these technologies will continue to be implemented despite what he views as the great harm that has been done by using them irresponsibly.</p>
<p>The WEF has been an active organization when it comes to crypto, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wef-launches-crypto-sustainability-coalition-to-leverage-web3-technologies-in-climate-change-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a> the Crypto Sustainability Coalition in September last year, with the objective of using Web3 tech to fight climate change.</p>
