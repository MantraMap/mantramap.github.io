					<description><![CDATA[Out of 8 billion people living on the planet, only 43 million people own Bitcoin &#8212; which amounts to less than 1% of the population. Despite the success of the cryptocurrency, a minuscule number of the world’s current inhabitants holds ownership of Bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap. Are there specific reasons why this is happening? Or is there something going on in the world of cryptocurrency that contributes to this current trend? Confusion Over &#8216;Ownership&#8217; And &#8216;Creation&#8217; Before anyone can have access to any form of cryptocurrency online, a user must create their own online wallet for the specific cryptocurrency they want to invest with. It is the same case with Bitcoin, as specific blockchain wallets are created for BTC.

This is where possible confusion might occur to those who are not familiar with the difference between creating a cryptocurrency wallet versus uniquely owning certain amounts of cryptocurrency. The unique ownership of the cryptocurrency itself (meaning that they have at least 1 or more BTC in their wallet) is only 43 million worldwide, despite that 46 million Americans have a share when it comes to BTC investment, according to ExplodingTopics.com. Current data on Bitcoin (BTC) ownership, source: CoinMarketCap Lack Of Confidence In The Current Crypto Market Although a growing number of people worldwide (especially in prominent countries such as the United States) are getting more interested in the potential of the power of cryptocurrency and its market, the lack of confidence hinders its potential growth. Due to the recent crypto market crash of 2022, many potential investors became paranoid about losing their money in an uncertain market at the moment.

					<description><![CDATA[Following the heavy market crash late last year, the crypto landscape has been on a steady path to recovery, with the altcoins leading the way. Solana(SOL) is one of these many altcoins, and it has kicked off the weekend with an explosive start.  According to data by CoinGecko, SOL has gained 40% in the last 24 hours, sparking excitement across the entire Solana ecosystem. Although it remains unknown how long the altcoin can sustain such momentum, these significant price gains indicate an increasing positive sentiment from investors. Interestingly, as a result of its price rally, Solana (SOL) even surpassed Polygon (MATIC) in market cap, becoming the 10th biggest cryptocurrency. However, this was only for a short time, as the Ethereum-based token has since reclaimed its position. At the time of writing, SOL trades at a price of $23.75 with a 24-hour trading volume of $2,499,092,493 based on data from CoinGecko. That said, the token’s market cap is set at $8,820,357,518, with a circulating supply of 370,622,211.  SOL trading at $22.42 &#124; Source: SOLUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: This Crypto Influencer Predicts Bitcoin Price At $25,000-$30,000 Soon Solana Has Been In The News Lately  Prior to today&#8217;s development, Solana has been one of the altcoins in the headlines mainly due to its impressive price action. On Dec. 30, 2022, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted a statement expressing support for Solana after the token’s value plummeted as much as 20% at the end of last year due to the FTX crisis. In the next 24 hours following Buterin’s tweet, SOL’s price surged by 12% from around $8.19 to $9.50. At the start of the second week of 2023, SOL was trading at a value of $17.1, representing a price increase of about 80.63% in just over a week. Since then, SOL has been moving sideways till its price surge today.  Asides from the tweet from Buterin, another propelling force behind Solana&#8217;s price actions were the massive price movements of the Solana-based meme coin BONK. Early this year, BONK, a new meme coin launched on December 25, gained over 2000% in the first week of the year, becoming the biggest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem.  Although BONK soon crashed 50% following its tremendous bullish run, there is still much optimism surrounding the meme coin as many investors expect it could return to the previous high price levels in the coming weeks.  Related Reading: Polkadot Shows No Sign Of Slowing, As DOT Gains 33% In Last 7 Days Price Prediction For Solana In 2023 According to top price prediction site, Wallet Investor, the price of SOL could fall as low as $5.875 in 2024, indicating a plausible 73.836% decrease from the current market price. However, Coincodex is predicting an overall bull market for Solana this year. The team expects SOL to trade at a value of $67.64 by 2024 if the altcoin follows the growth trajectory of the internet over the next 12 months.  Regardless of the price predictions, Solana has started the year strong and appears to be one of the most promising projects for 2023. That said, investors are reminded not to rely on price predictions when making investment decisions; rather, they should do their due diligence while consulting market financial experts.  Featured Image: Solana.com, Chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The start of 2023 is bringing a different phase in the crypto market. Over the past few days, most crypto assets have regained value. The bullish trend has spiked a new sentiment in the market as several positive predictions have emerged. Ben Armstrong, a popular YouTuber known as BitBoy, predicted a bullish trend for Bitcoin in a few weeks. Armstrong, the author of a new book &#8220;Catching Up To Crypto&#8221; took to Twitter to express his views on BTC’s future price surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze: $93 Million Shorts Liquidated In One Hour Bitcoin Price Rally Triggers Bullish Sentiment According to Armstrong, the primary crypto asset has triggered a bullish sentiment in the crypto community with its recent uptrend. Finally, BTC broke the barrier and climbed to the $18,000 level. As of January 12, the leading token reached $19K during trading hours. A review of the price history indicated that BTC reached the $15K region in November 2022. Notably, Bitcoin started alternating between $16,000 and $17,000 in December 2022. But this 2023, the primary crypto asset is showing impressive price movement. According to BitBoy’s post on Twitter, Bitcoin will gradually reach $25,000 or $30,000 this year. He forecasted that BTC would attain this new price rally within the next 10 to 15 weeks. Also, several people are becoming bullish in their trades with Bitcoin. On January 11, Armstrong posted about his belief in Bitcoin’s price explosion in 2023. However, the controversial YouTuber noted that the primary cryptocurrency might not hit a new all-time high (ATH) this year. On January 12, Bitcoin slightly hit the $19,000 level before retracting to the $18K level. BTC&#8217;s new price rally is likely due to the risk-on sentiments associated with other markets. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is hovering around $20,627. This shows that the token increased by 3.50% within 24 hours. Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap is about $366.43 billion having a surge of 4.62% in the past day. Also, its dominance over altcoins is 40.26%. Recall that in December 2022, Armstrong gave a forecast for Bitcoin. According to BitBoy’s tweet, the end of 2023 will see BTC reaching the $30,000 level. Also, he predicted the token would finally hit a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of 2024, while a new cycle of bearish trend would break out in 2025. But now, analysts believe BTC will reach the price mark in a few weeks. Crypto Whales Resume Transactions In Bitcoin With the recent BTC price rally, some crypto whales have resumed massive transactions in BTC. Some of the on-chain data providers have recorded huge BTC transactions recently. According to WhaleAlert, an unknown whale moved 5,545 BTC tokens to another anonymous wallet. The value of coins is worth over $104.3 million in the current market prices. On January 12, 4.000 BTC tokens worth $72.51 million were moved from an unknown wallet to the Huobi crypto exchange.

Whales are beginning to take interest and are likely perpetuating this climb, with $1M+ $BTC transactions rebounding to November, 2022 levels. https://t.co/UuH8aFUmh3 pic.twitter.com/2oeIyi3xSV &#8212; Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 12, 2023 The data provider reported that the BTC whale transactions average had exceeded 1,700 daily. This new average occurred for the first time in the past two months.]]></description>

<p>Recall that in December 2022, Armstrong gave a forecast for Bitcoin. According to BitBoy’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Bitboy_Crypto/status/1607370331483766786" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet</a>, the end of 2023 will see BTC reaching the $30,000 level. Also, he predicted the token would finally hit a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of 2024, while a new cycle of bearish trend would break out in 2025. But now, analysts believe BTC will reach the price mark in a few weeks.</p>
<h2>Crypto Whales Resume Transactions In Bitcoin</h2>
<p>With the recent BTC price rally, some crypto whales have resumed massive transactions in BTC. Some of the on-chain data providers have recorded huge BTC transactions recently.</p>
<p>According to WhaleAlert, an unknown whale moved <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1613781016379887618" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">5,545 BTC tokens</a> to another anonymous wallet. The value of coins is worth over $104.3 million in the current market prices. On January 12, 4.000 BTC tokens worth $72.51 million were moved from an unknown wallet to the Huobi crypto exchange.</p>

<p>Further, Santiment, an on-chain data firm, <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1613615076686323712" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirms</a> the increasing whale transactions involving BTC.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Due to the Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto market uncertainty, predicting the following trend pattern for crypto assets is usually difficult. However, analysts have always released predictions for most crypto assets. While some projections turned out to be accurate, some still failed to happen as predicted. One analyst became popular for releasing an accurate prediction for Bitcoin&#8217;s 2018 bottom six months before the period. However, the pseudonymous analyst and trader, Smart Contracter, is suddenly bullish in his recent predictions. Analyst Scraps Bearish Stance On Bitcoin (BTC) Smart Contracter took to Twitter to inform his followers about his plan to scrap his bearish bias on the BTC/USD trading pair. His new decision was based on the recent Bitcoin price breaking out to a higher range.

He explained that the BTC&#8217;s price action is currently more impressive due to the impulsive disposition.

Further, Smart Contracter projected charts to explain the possible price trend for the leading crypto asset. For example, he predicted that Bitcoin would surge by more than $18,800. Also, he used Elliot Wave Theory to support his technical analysis for BTC.

<h2>BTCUSD Levels To Watch For Next </h2>
<p>Considering how bearish the sentiment was throughout 2022, crypto holders aren&#8217;t yet ready to FOMO into Bitcoin simply due to a break of $20,000. The top cryptocurrency may need to rally higher before the crowd begins to pile in.</p>

<p>Bitcoin above $28,000 could be a sign of a more sustainable recovery. Meanwhile, rejection at $20,000 again could be catastrophic for the crypto market and cause BTC to try for new lows.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Monero price has rallied over the past week since the broader market recovered. Over the last 24 hours, XMR was consolidating despite its weekly gains. The coin traded laterally over the past few sessions before it started to dip on its chart. As momentum halted recently, it is still uncertain whether XMR will resume its upward price movement. The technical outlook of the coin continued to side with the bulls despite lateral trading. Accumulation remains high on the chart despite a downtick in demand over the last trading sessions. Monero also displayed overbuying tendencies, and the recent fall in the asset&#8217;s value could be tied to a price correction. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Divergence: What To Expect In 2023 The altcoin can prevent considerable loss if Monero stays above its immediate support line. The market capitalization of Monero declined slightly, meaning that the coin encountered selling in the past trading sessions. At the current price, the coin was trading at 70% low than its all-time high secured in 2021. Monero Price Analysis: One-Day Chart XMR was trading at $166 at press time. Over the last week, the coin secured gains and pierced through various resistance lines. The coin crossed the $157 resistance line and flipped it into a support zone for itself. Monero was trading on an ascending trendline (white), typically characterized by a breakout, either on the upside or the downside. Over the last 24 hours, XMR diverted from the trendline and fell on its chart. This could imply that the coin will depreciate and rest at $163, then drop to $157 before rising again. For Monero, there was stiff resistance at $169, which is why the coin could not move past it. The resistance above the line has not been breached since July last year. The amount of Monero traded in the previous session was red, indicating that the coin experienced some selling. Technical Analysis Although XMR noted a slight downtick in demand, sellers were minimal compared to buyers. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was still above the 70 mark. This indicated that the asset was overbought, which means that a price correction for Monero was on its way. Depicting bullishness, XMR was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), indicating that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. XMR also rested above the 50-SMA (yellow) and 200-SMA (green) lines. Per the increase in accumulation, the technical outlook depicts buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reads the price momentum and trend reversals. MACD formed green signal bars, but the last bar declined in height. This ideally means that the price is expected to fall.

					<description><![CDATA[Career commodities trader Peter L. Brandt is now claiming that Bitcoin is putting in a &#8220;low for this cycle now,&#8221; according to a new TradingView post. This call for a bear market bottom is already being met with skepticism, but given the chilling accuracy at which Brandt had made related to his cryptocurrency bets in the past, there could be more validity than investors are ready to accept. Peter L. Brandt TradingView Post Calls For Cycle Low In BTC In a new TradingView post currently trending on the charting platform&#8217;s editor&#8217;s picks section, career commodities trader Peter L. Brandt says that the cycle lows for the crypto market are taking place &#8220;now.&#8221; Although Brandt doesn&#8217;t directly state that the bottom is already in, he does believe that Bitcoin&#8217;s behavior is &#8220;predictable&#8221; and should see a strong advance after the recent, nearly 80% decline. Related Reading: “Parabolic” Signal That Triggered Past Bitcoin Bull Runs Reappears Brandt famously called for an 80% decline in BTCUSD in late January 2018 after the 2017 parabolic advance was violated. Back then, Brandt called it a &#8220;general TA rule, eventually nailing his sub-$4,000 target some eleven months later in December of the same year. A closer look at Brandt's analysis &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com What The Career Trader Expects For Bitcoin In 2023 And Beyond &#8220;I do not expect Bitcoin to run away to the upside, but rather work higher toward late 2023/early to mid 2024 when the ATHs are retested,&#8221; he explained, sharing the chart above to justify the analysis. The Factor LLCCEO is a classical chartist, and in his TradingView post shares a 6-month timeframe bar chart. Other visual cues aiding his analysis include the largest sell volume ever on the BTCUSD index chart. Peter L. Brandt has earned himself a polarizing reputation in the cryptocurrency community. The comments section is already taking jabs at the trader with 40 years experience. Related Reading: Currency Expert Explains Why Altcoins Experience More Carnage Than Bitcoin And Ethereum According to the CMT Association, Brandt founded Factor LLC in 1980, but entered the commodities trading business beginning in 1976 with ContiCommodity Services. He is also published author, releasing the book &#8220;Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader: Lessons from 21 Weeks of Real Trading&#8221; in 2011 – the same year he was named one of the 30 most influential persons in the world of finance by Barry Ritholtz.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin spot and derivative exchange reserves have both shot up recently, a sign that could be bearish for the price. Bitcoin Spot And Derivative Reserves Register Growth As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the open interest and the funding rates are also heating up in the BTC market. The &#8220;exchange reserve&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that investors are depositing into wallets of centralized exchanges right now. This metric has two versions; one is for the spot exchanges, while the other is for the derivative platforms. Usually, investors deposit to spot exchanges for selling purposes, so an increase in the reserves of these platforms can suggest selling pressure is rising in the market. And as holders use derivative exchanges for opening positions on the futures market, a rise in this reserve can lead to higher volatility (the effect on the price can be in either direction). Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze: $93 Million Shorts Liquidated In One Hour Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in these Bitcoin exchange reserves over the last month: The values of all the metrics seem to have seen a rise in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, both the spot and derivative exchange reserves have increased in value recently, suggesting that investors have been making deposits to these platforms. The increased spot reserves suggest an elevated selling pressure in the market, while the derivative reserves imply an overheated futures sector. The chart also includes data for two other metrics, the open interest, and the funding rates. The &#8220;open interest&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of futures positions currently open on derivative exchanges. This metric takes into account both short and long contracts. The graph shows that this metric has also trended up recently, further suggesting that the futures market is currently overheated. The other indicator, the &#8220;funding rates,&#8221; tells us whether there are more shorts or longs in the market. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal: LINK Address Activity Returns To 2021 Levels The Bitcoin funding rates are favorable now, implying that the longs are overwhelming the shorts. Generally, whichever way this metric swing tells us which of these contract holders is more at risk of a liquidation squeeze. So far, there hasn&#8217;t been any long squeeze in the market, but rather a short squeeze as the price has been able to keep up the momentum. There have been some high liquidations during the past day that may have helped calm the overheated futures market for now, but since there is increased selling pressure on the spot exchanges, BTC is still at risk for a short-term pullback. BTC Price At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $19,100, up 14% in the last week. Looks like the value of the crypto has surged in the last few days &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Thought Catalog on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com]]></description>

<h2>Bitcoin Spot And Derivative Reserves Register Growth</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63c0245b17484d0af145dd81-Pullback-expected-in-the-short-term" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, the open interest and the funding rates are also heating up in the BTC market. The &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/usdc-exchange-reserve-spikes-push-bitcoin-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exchange reserve</a>&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that investors are depositing into wallets of centralized exchanges right now.</p>

<p>And as holders use derivative exchanges for opening positions on the futures market, a rise in this reserve can lead to higher volatility (the effect on the price can be in either direction).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/6614/quicktake/YihxMpol7_8339c31b0cb45cdbbde898ba16d95940fdaeda930cc6d2de7d396201c3ad7eb4.png" alt="Bitcoin Exchange Reserves" width="1280" height="646" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, both the spot and derivative exchange reserves have increased in value recently, suggesting that investors have been making deposits to these platforms. The increased spot reserves suggest an elevated selling pressure in the market, while the derivative reserves imply an overheated futures sector.</p>
<p>The chart also includes data for two other metrics, the open interest, and the funding rates. The &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-open-interest-rsi-bear-divergence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open interest</a>&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of futures positions currently open on derivative exchanges. This metric takes into account both short and long contracts.</p>
<p>The graph shows that this metric has also trended up recently, further suggesting that the futures market is currently overheated. The other indicator, the &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/stabilizing-ethereum-funding-rates-suggests-recovery-might-be-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding rates</a>,&#8221; tells us whether there are more shorts or longs in the market.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin funding rates are favorable now, implying that the longs are overwhelming the shorts. Generally, whichever way this metric swing tells us which of these contract holders is more at risk of a liquidation squeeze.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn&#8217;t been any long squeeze in the market, but rather a short squeeze as the price has been able to keep up the momentum. There have been some <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rise-above-19000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high liquidations</a> during the past day that may have helped calm the overheated futures market for now, but since there is increased selling pressure on the spot exchanges, BTC is still at risk for a short-term pullback.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $19,100, up 14% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market is still facing a declining effect from the raging crypto winter, but  XRP is faring on the daily chart. Since last year, several crypto assets have been struggling to stay afloat as the prices of tokens fluctuate. Unfortunately, the overall outcome has not impressed many crypto participants and investors. But the new year is bringing a positive turn in the crypto market. Some crypto tokens have started reclaiming their value over the past seven days. For example, XRP has taken a more vital route as it joins the train of bullish tokens for an upward move.
