He warned that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations will &#x201C;crush&#x201D; most other cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Buys More Bitcoin, Warns About SEC Regulations Crushing Crypto Tokens</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has revealed the key reason why he is investing in bitcoin. The famous author warned that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will &#x201C;crush&#x201D; most other crypto tokens with its regulations.</p>
<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Friday that he is investing in bitcoin. He explained that he is &#x201C;very excited&#x201D; about <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> because the cryptocurrency &#x201C;is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil.&#x201D; The Rich Dad Poor Dad author added that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified bitcoin as a commodity while most other crypto tokens are securities, cautioning that &#x201C;SEC regulations will crush most of them.&#x201D; He ended his tweet by stating that he is buying more bitcoin.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bitcoin-commodity-1.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20221231%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221231T141441Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=7c89d42ede7686acee38ee782f3b69d172c2e1cac483ef039684f6bffea6cac8"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-566627 aligncenter" title="Robert Kiyosaki Buying More Bitcoin &#x2014; Warns SEC Regulations Will Crush Most Cryptocurrencies" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bitcoin-commodity-1.jpg" alt="Robert Kiyosaki Buying More Bitcoin &#x2014; Warns SEC Regulations Will Crush Most Cryptocurrencies" width="929" height="427" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bitcoin-commodity-1-300x138.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bitcoin-commodity-1-768x353.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bitcoin-commodity-1.jpg 929w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px"></a></p>
<p>SEC Chairman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-bitcoin-is-a-commodity/">Gary Gensler</a> has said repeatedly that bitcoin is a commodity while <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-insists-most-crypto-tokens-are-securities-says-the-law-is-clear/">most other crypto tokens are securities</a>. The chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, has also confirmed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-bitcoin-ether-are-commodities/">bitcoin is a commodity</a>.</p>
<p>The securities regulator said in November that its Enforcement Division remains <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-enforcement-remains-focused-on-crypto-chair-gensler-says-hes-impressed-with-enforcement-results/">focused on crypto</a>. The SEC has been heavily criticized for taking an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/commissioner-sec-enforcement-centric-approach-crypto-regulation/">enforcement-centric approach</a> to regulating the crypto sector. Gensler said in May following the terra/luna collapse that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-warns-a-lot-of-crypto-tokens-will-fail-luna-ust-collapse/">a lot of crypto tokens will fail</a>.</p>

<p>The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has been recommending investors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-last-chance-to-buy-gold-and-silver-at-low-prices-says-stock-market-crash-will-send-them-higher/">buy gold, silver, and bitcoin</a> for quite some time. Kiyosaki previously said he is a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-im-a-bitcoin-investor-when-btc-hits-new-bottom-i-get-excited/">bitcoin investor</a>, not a trader, so he gets excited when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> hits a new bottom.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, he predicted that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoin-investors-to-get-richer-when-fed-pivots-prints-trillions-of-dollars/">bitcoin investors will get richer</a> when the Federal Reserve pivots and prints trillions of &#x201C;fake&#x201D; dollars. Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Kiyosaki said he is still <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-im-still-bullish-on-bitcoin-crypto-cannot-be-blamed-for-ftx-collapse/">bullish on bitcoin</a>, emphasizing that crypto cannot be blamed for the FTX meltdown. In September, the renowned author urged investors to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-urges-investors-to-get-into-crypto-now-before-biggest-economic-crash-in-world-history/">get into crypto now</a>, before the biggest market crash strikes.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki also made other dire predictions, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-us-dollar-will-crash-by-january-suggests-buying-bitcoin/">U.S. dollar crashing</a>, the Fed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-fed-rate-hikes-will-destroy-us-economy-says-invest-in-real-money-bitcoin/">destroying the U.S. economy</a> with its rate hikes, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-warns-hyperinflation-depression-are-here/">hyperinflation</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-warns-inflation-may-lead-to-greater-depression/">a Greater Depression</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-world-war-iii/">World War III</a>.</p>

Two FTX-owned crypto exchanges, FTX Japan and Liquid, are developing a system to allow withdrawals by mid-February.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX&#8217;s Japanese Customers Can Withdraw Funds Soon</h2>
<p>Two FTX-owned cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan — FTX Japan and Liquid — jointly announced Thursday that their users will be able to withdraw funds by mid-February. The two crypto exchanges announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the assets entrusted to us by our customers at FTX Japan and Liquid Japan, we are proceeding with system development so that withdrawals will be possible from the Liquid Japan website.</p></blockquote>
<p>To withdraw funds, FTX Japan&#8217;s customers will need to open an account with Liquid and transfer their assets to the Liquid platform. The exchanges plan to allow withdrawals by mid-February, according to the joint announcement.</p>
<p>Japanese exchange Liquid was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-japanese-crypto-market-acquisition-regulated-crypto-exchange/">acquired</a> by FTX earlier this year. The deal included Quoine Corp., one of the first crypto exchanges to successfully register in 2017 with Japan&#8217;s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA).</p>

<p>The acquisition followed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-liquid-hacked-loses-millions-in-various-currencies/">a major hack</a> where about $90 million worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen from the Liquid platform. FTX then provided Liquid with $120 million of debt financing at that time.</p>
<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11. However, FTX Japan said on Dec. 1 that it had confirmed with lawyers for the FTX group that &#8220;Japanese customer cash and cryptocurrency should not be part of FTX Japan’s estate given how these assets are held and property interests under Japanese law.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, the FSA <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-regulator-slaps-ftx-japan-with-business-suspension-order/">issued three orders</a> against FTX Japan: a business suspension order, an order to hold assets domestically, and a business improvement order. The orders followed the exchange abruptly halting customer withdrawals. The following day, FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed for bankruptcy</a> in the U.S. The exchange and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charged</a> by the U.S. government and regulators with multiple counts of fraud.</p>

During the last week, statistics show that $147,054,554 in NFT sales were recorded across 334,668 NFT buyers.</strong></p>
<h2>NFT Sales Continue to Slip: 13.97% Decrease in Last Seven Days</h2>
<p>NFT sales are down this week, 13.97% lower than last week according to cryptoslam.io <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">metrics</a>. 2022 hasn&#x2019;t been a good year for NFTs as sales and NFT values have slid dramatically over the last 12 months. Out of the $147.05 million in NFT sales this past week, NFTs that derived from Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) represented $113.86 million of the aggregate sold in seven days. However, ETH-based NFT sales slipped by 20.4% during the past week.</p>

<p>Solana NFT sales jumped 91.36% higher this week as the chain saw $23.64 million in seven-day sales. While Solana&#x2019;s increase was large, Waves-based NFT sales increased by 302.59% but only sold $7,609 worth of NFTs. Theta&#x2019;s NFT sales jumped by 132.29% over the last week but only sold $358 worth of digital collectibles.</p>
<p>Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) was this week&#x2019;s top collection in terms of seven-day sales as it raked in $12.59 million. However, the $12.59 million over 144 sales is 47.05% lower than BAYC&#x2019;s sales last week. BAYC is followed by Otherdeeds, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Azuki, and Cryptopunks, respectively. Cryptopunks managed to jump 94.71% higher in terms of sales this week compared to last week&#x2019;s sales.</p>

<p>The Solana NFT project Degods, which plans to transition the NFTs to the Ethereum chain, saw sales climb 253.80% higher than Degods&#x2019; sales last week. Data shows the most expensive digital collectible sold over the past seven days was Azuki #4,690 which sold three days ago for $216K. Azuki #4,690 was followed by Azuki #2,311, Azuki #9,446, and Bored Ape Yacht Club #193.</p>
<p>The top three most expensive floor value prices for NFTs today include BAYC, Cryptopunks, and Mutant Ape Yacht Club. BAYC has a floor value of 69.49 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> according to nftpricefloor.com, while the Cryptopunks floor value is currently 65.47 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>

Currently, with electricity costs at $0.07 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), only 18 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining rigs are able to turn a profit at current prices.</strong></p>
<h2>Current SHA256 ASIC Models Unprofitable at $0.12 per kWh, Only Two Devices Profitable at $0.10 per kWh</h2>
<p>On December 31, 2022, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221231125335/https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">statistics</a> show that bitcoin&#x2019;s hash rate is hovering above the 300 exahash per second (EH/s) range after reaching a low on December 30 at 235 EH/s. Additionally, <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost">data</a> from macromicro.me indicates that the current cost of production ($16,577) is nearly equal to bitcoin&#x2019;s current spot market value ($16,572).</p>

<p>Macromicro.me calculates the cost of production by &#x201C;observing consumption of electricity and daily issuance of bitcoin, as provided by Cambridge University.&#x201D; The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) shows <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index">annualized consumption</a> on Dec. 31, 2022, is 84.74 terawatts per hour (TWh). With the current mining difficulty at 35.36 trillion and current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices at $16,572 per unit, a large number of ASIC mining machines are not profitable.</p>

<p>For instance, at $0.12 per kWh, none of the current SHA256 ASIC models are profitable with electricity costs at that rate. At $0.10 per kWh, two ASIC devices are profitable and can make $1.14-$2.51 per day in profits. The top two machines that can still profit at $0.10 per kWh include Bitmain&#x2019;s Antminer S19 XP Hyd. with 255 terahash per second (TH/s) and Bitmain&#x2019;s Antminer S19 XP with 140 TH/s.</p>
<h2>18 ASIC Mining Rigs Profitable at $0.07 per kWh, Alternative Consensus Algorithms See Better Profits</h2>
<p>At $0.08 per kWh, 13 different ASIC bitcoin mining machines can capture profits between $0.13-$5.08 per day. The machine with the lowest profits at $0.08 per kWh is Bitmain&#x2019;s Antminer S19j Pro with 100 TH/s. At $0.07 per kWh, another five machines are added to the profitable machine list with a total of 18 ASIC mining rigs in profit.</p>
<p>At the $0.07 per kWh value, a bitcoin miner can make between $0.23 per day to $6.35 per day, depending on the machine used. Bitmain&#x2019;s Antminer S19 XP Hyd. with 255 TH/s and $0.07 per kWh in electrical costs will produce an estimated profit of around $6.35 every 24 hours.</p>

<p>While SHA256 bitcoin mining machines are seeing fewer profits than they were six months ago, machines that mine alternative consensus algorithms see better profits. The top three consensus algorithms today, in terms of profit, include Kadena, Eaglesong, Scrypt, and Handshake.</p>

He believes that future cryptocurrency bull runs probably won&#x2019;t happen. However, Moss says that bitcoin will continue to see demand as it is &#x201C;solving a problem that has plagued humanity from Day One.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Market Disruptor CEO Predicts Regulatory Shift in Wake of FTX Collapse, Sees Most Cryptocurrency Assets Regulated as Securities in Future</h2>
<p>On Dec. 29, 2022, Mark Moss, the CEO of Market Disruptor, <a href="https://youtu.be/vlxs2PSz78s">spoke</a> with Michelle Makori, the lead anchor of Kitco News and the company&#x2019;s editor-in-chief, about the cryptocurrency industry and bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>). Moss believes that the recent FTX collapse has accelerated regulation, and he thinks that most cryptocurrency assets will be regulated as securities in the future. As an example, the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x2019;s (SEC) charges against FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-against-ftx-alameda-execs-wang-and-ellison-reveal-key-findings-us-regulator-says-ftt-is-a-security/">define</a> FTX&#x2019;s exchange token, FTT, as an unregulated security.</p>
<p>To furnish another specific example, a New Hampshire court also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-hampshire-court-sides-with-sec-in-lawsuit-against-lbry-projects-team-says-loss-sets-a-dangerous-precedent/">sided with the SEC</a> in the lawsuit against LBRY, and LBRY said the language used to sway the court&#x2019;s decision &#x201C;sets an extraordinarily dangerous precedent.&#x201D; Moss told Makori that deeming most crypto tokens as securities will likely force projects to create full disclosures for investors. &#x201C;Imagine Ethereum going through full disclosure,&#x201D; Moss said during the interview. &#x201C;Who created the token? How many [coins] are controlled by insiders?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Market Disruptor executive and author of the <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x201D;The Un-Communist Manifesto&#x201D;</span> added:</p>
<blockquote><p>What&#x2019;s the connection between the Ethereum Foundation, Joseph Lubin, and Vitalik Buterin? Who controls the tokens in The Merge lockup?&#x2026; I can&#x2019;t imagine they&#x2019;d want to [go through full disclosure].</p></blockquote>
<p>Moss said that it&#x2019;s likely some crypto projects move offshore, but he stressed that he believes the money from U.S. investors won&#x2019;t follow these projects. &#x201C;Sure, the SEC clamps down and [cryptocurrencies] goes offshore &#x2026; to some small jurisdiction,&#x201D; Moss said to Makori. &#x201C;But the American venture capital companies can&#x2019;t skate past U.S. regulations to try to invest in these little obscure markets. So sure, it&#x2019;ll move to another country&#x2026; but the money won&#x2019;t go with it, which drives the entire market cap.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While Moss doesn&#x2019;t expect another altcoin season or crypto bull run, he does believe the leading crypto asset bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) will continue to prosper. Moss insists <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is a &#x201C;technological revolution that changes the course of humanity and drives financial markets.&#x201D; Moss further said that he doesn&#x2019;t want the regulatory hammer to come crashing down, and further insisted that he was just explaining the case as he sees it unfolding. Moss stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now is the time [regulators] are going to be forced to react. The SEC looks horrible &#x2026; the [SEC&#x2019;s] number one job is to protect consumers, and they have failed. They should shut down in disgrace and close up shop &#x2026; Of course that&#x2019;s not going to happen, but they need to regain confidence somehow, and I believe [the FTX collapse] is going to force [regulators] to act.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Moss Forecasts Bitcoin Price to Reach $33K-$38K Next Year, Debate Over Securities Classification in Crypto Industry Looms</h2>
<p>In 2023, Moss expects <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to hit $33K per unit and possibly even $38K. &#x201C;Bitcoin is solving a problem that has plagued humanity from Day One, which is, how do I secure my property so it can&#x2019;t be manipulated, seized, or stolen?&#x2019;&#x201D; Moss remarked. &#x201C;I can have custody of [Bitcoin] and if I want to send it to you, nobody could stop it, block it, or prevent it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a lot of debate over whether specific crypto assets should be considered securities, and in the U.S., regulators have not reached a full consensus. For example, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said that most crypto tokens are securities and he once <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-insists-most-crypto-tokens-are-securities-says-the-law-is-clear/">said</a> the &#x201C;law is clear on this.&#x201D; &#x201C;I believe based on the facts and circumstances, most of these tokens are securities,&#x201D; Gensler said during an interview.</p>

<p>Gensler also once <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-bitcoin-is-a-commodity/">declared</a> that he could confirm that bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) is a commodity, but it&#x2019;s the only crypto token he would talk about in that fashion. In May, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Rostin Behnam <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-bitcoin-ether-are-commodities/">said</a> he could surely say bitcoin is a commodity. &#x201C;Well, I can say for sure bitcoin &#x2026; is a commodity. Ether as well,&#x201D; Behnam elaborated during his interview with CNBC.</p>

The new form of national fiat has brought no benefits to the banks and should expand beyond being employed only as a substitute for cash, the banker believes.</strong></p>
<h2>Common People Used to Cash and Cards, Ex-PBOC Executive Notes</h2>
<p>Usage of China’s central bank digital currency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) has been “low, highly inactive,” according to Xie Ping, former director-general of research at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). Ping made this observation at a conference devoted to digital finance.</p>
<p>“The cumulative circulation of the digital yuan in the two years of the trial has been only 100 billion yuan” ($14 billion), he detailed, quoted by the financial news outlet Caixin and Reuters. In his view, the application of the digital yuan needed to be widened.</p>
<p>“The results are not ideal,” Xie concluded during the forum which was organized by the Tsinghua University. He emphasized that “what needs to change is the digital yuan acting only as a substitute for cash and only for consumption.”</p>
<p>The payment market structure formed by cash, bank cards, and third-party payment platforms are currently satisfying the needs for daily consumption in China. “The common people are used to it, and changing it is difficult,” he remarked.</p>

<p>China has been at the forefront of the race to develop CBDCs with efforts to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-has-dispersed-over-40-million-of-digital-yuan-in-red-envelopes-report-reveals/">promote</a> the digital yuan through a number of red envelope campaigns, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-yuan-giveaway-shenzhen-residents-to-receive-15-million-yuan-in-digital-currency/">giving away</a> e-CNY to stimulate its use, and by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-to-expand-digital-yuan-testing-in-pilot-cities-to-provincial-level/">expanding</a> the geographical scope of the pilot project to new cities and regions.</p>
<p>Authorities have also been trying to increase the use cases for the digital version of the renminbi, with the latest examples including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-introduces-digital-yuan-payments-in-ningbo-subway-guangzhou-buses/">introduction</a> of digital yuan payments in the public transportation systems of Ningbo and Guangzhou. In September, the PBOC called for more of these use-case scenarios and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-china-calls-for-increasing-use-of-digital-yuan/">urged</a> for deeper integration of its new currency with e-payment providers.</p>
<p>According to Xie Ping, digital yuan business had no synergistic effect and no commercial benefits for banks’ business while third-party payment systems such as Alipay offered a range of more attractive functions such as investment, insurance, and consumer lending.</p>
<p>That’s why the ex-central bank official believes digital yuan usage can be expanded by allowing individuals to buy financial products with the state-backed coin, for example, and by connecting it to more traditional payment platforms in order to create new opportunities to spend it for consumption.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tokio Marine to Offer Insurance in Metaverse</h2>
<p>While gaming, social, and tech companies have been the first in embracing the metaverse as a concept, other companies are now also entering available metaverse platforms. Tokio Marine, the biggest property and casualty insurance group in Japan, has announced that it will start offering insurance services in the metaverse. The company will offer insurance and other kinds of policies in the digital world in January, employing real clerks that will be represented as avatars.</p>
<p>Interested users will be able to interact with the clerks and inquire about the details of each one of the products offered, as well as send and complete forms and even conclude contracts in the metaverse, according to <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/business/companies/20221229-80593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> from Yomiuri Shimbun.</p>
<p>The company will host these services on Virtual Akiba World, a metaverse platform that has been built as a digital representation of the famous station and town of Akihabara in Japan. About the reason for the extension of these services to the virtual world, the company stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By using the metaverse, we will provide a new customer experience that reduces the psychological burden of insurance consultations and enables casual insurance consultations and considerations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Furthermore, the company will allow users to run a course with a flying car in the metaverse to help it determine the style of driving the consumer prefers, as well as to familiarize it with the advantages that insurance could bring to specific drivers.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Other Japanese Companies in the Metaverse</h2>
<p>Asian and Japanese companies have been pioneers in the metaverse field, with several investing in the development of virtual tech directed to target this new field. One of these companies is MUFG, one of the largest banks in the country, which has already announced it will start offering banking services in the metaverse by 2023.</p>
<p>In October, NTT Docomo, a leading Japanese telecom carrier, announced the launch of its own metaverse division with an investment of $412 million, having more than 200 employees focusing on these tasks in November.</p>

The monetary authority intends to proceed with more testing in 2023 and plans to invite banks and fintech companies to join the trials.</strong></p>
<h2>Turkey to Widen Participation in Digital Lira Project, Focus on Studying Economic and Legal Aspects</h2>
<p>Turkey’s monetary authority has successfully carried out the first payment transactions on the Digital Turkish Lira Network, according to an <a href="https://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/Announcements/Press+Releases/2022/ANO2022-55" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> on Thursday. The operations were executed as part of studies during the first phase of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) project.</p>
<p>The CBRT also said it will continue to perform pilot tests with technology stakeholders in the first quarter of next year, on a limited scale and in a closed-circuit environment. The findings from these tests will be revealed to the public in a comprehensive evaluation report, it promised.</p>
<p>Also in 2023, the Turkish central bank intends to expand the collaboration platform for the digital lira. Selected banks and financial technology companies will be involved and advanced phases of the pilot study unveiled to further widen participation, the regulator detailed, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Against this backdrop, the CBRT will continue to run tests for authentic architectural setups designed in areas such as the use of distributed ledger technologies in payment systems and the integration of these technologies with instant payment systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bank also emphasized that examination of the legal aspects of the CBDC has shown that “digital identification is of critical importance for the project.” For this reason, the CBRT intends to prioritize studies on the legal and economic framework of the digital lira as well as its technological requirements.</p>
<p>The potential issuing of a “blockchain-based” version of the Turkish lira was first <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turkey-becomes-the-latest-nation-to-work-on-digital-fiat/">mentioned</a> in President Recep Erdogan’s Annual Program in November, 2019. Two years later, the CBRT <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-turkey-expands-research-prepares-to-test-digital-lira-on-new-platform/">deepened research</a> into the matter by establishing the Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform to facilitate the development and testing of the CBDC with technology stakeholders.</p>

The company will develop blockchain-based automation for vehicle financing processes, and also a rewards program for customers of the automotive company adapted to compliance processes in Thailand.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">BMW to Introduce Blockchain to Its Operations</h2>
<p>More companies are introducing blockchain processes as part of their operations due to the ostensible reliability of the tech and how it can help save on costs. On Dec. 29, BMW, the German car manufacturer, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-12-29/coinweb-to-deliver-cross-chain-smart-contract-architecture-and-blockchain-loyalty-programme-to-bmw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with Coinweb, a layer 2 (L2) blockchain interoperability protocol, to introduce blockchain-based processes to its operations.</p>
<p>This alliance contemplates two different tasks. The first includes the development of a smart contracts platform with the objective of streamlining different processes that need to be completed for the financing of BMW-branded vehicles. According to a press release, this would encompass the implementation of a &#8220;fully integrated Anti Money Laundering (AML) &amp; Know Your Customer (KYC) tool&#8221; adapted to Thailand&#8217;s local laws.</p>
<p>The second task is the creation of a blockchain-based loyalty program to reward customers of the brand with products and services, assigning a rank to each customer directly related to their rewards accumulation.</p>
<p>Coinweb stated that it will use Binance&#8217;s Bnb Chain as the anchor chain for these transactions due to its performance-to-cost ratio. However, the transactions could be broadcasted to other blockchains if needed.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Benefits of Decentralized Ledger Technology</h2>
<p>Bjorn Antonsson, CEO of BMW Leasing in Thailand, explained the benefits of shifting part of its processes to decentralized tech platforms. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We foresee this shift of manual paperwork towards immutable records on the blockchain to immensely contribute to infallible efficiency and transparency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BMW&#8217;s deal comes at a time when blockchain-based tech is being affected by the cryptocurrency market downtrend due in part to the downfall of FTX, one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world. As Nobel laureate Paul Krugman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nobel-prize-laureate-paul-krugman-warns-of-an-eternal-winter-for-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> on Dec. 1, some significant non-crypto blockchain-based projects like <a href="https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/11/29/maersk-and-ibm-to-discontinue-tradelens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tradelens</a>, a Maersk-backed global trading platform, and the blockchain-based <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australian-securities-exchange-cut-up-200-jobs-blockchain-project-2022-12-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engine</a> that was being developed for the Australian Stock exchange, have been recently canceled.</p>
<p>Even so, Coinweb is positive about the result that this alliance could bring for the perception of how useful blockchain tech can be. Coinweb CEO Toby Gilbert declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hope that once this project is fully launched, it can be used as a benchmark to prove that traditional businesses can fully leverage blockchain technology and benefit hugely from it, without deviating from their core values and mission.</p>

<h2>Fidelity&#8217;s Crypto and Metaverse Trademark Applications</h2>
<p>Fidelity Investments filed three trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) last week for a wide range of cryptocurrency, non-fungible token (NFT), and metaverse products and services. Fidelity has $9.6 trillion in assets under administration as of Sept. 30; the financial services firm serves about 40 million individual investors.</p>
<p>Mike Kondoudis, a USPTO-licensed trademark attorney, tweeted Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fidelity has plans for the metaverse! The company has filed 3 trademark applications covering NFTs + NFT marketplaces, metaverse investment services, virtual real estate investing, cryptocurrency trading, and more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial services giant&#8217;s trademark applications were filed on Dec. 21. Their serial numbers are 97727473, 97727439, and 97727409.</p>
<p>The applications specifically detail a vast number of products and services &#8220;in the metaverse and other virtual worlds,&#8221; including mutual fund investment services, retirement fund investment services, investment management services, financial planning, securities brokerage services, money management, financial analysis, and investment management.</p>
<p>Fidelity is no stranger to the metaverse. In April, the financial services firm opened a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-launches-multi-level-learning-center-in-metaverse/">multi-level learning center</a> called &#8220;The Fidelity Stack&#8221; in Decentraland. The firm also launched a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-investments-launches-crypto-metaverse-etfs-says-we-continue-to-see-demand/">metaverse exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) in the same month.</p>
<p>In November, Fidelity Investments began offering commission-free <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-investments-launching-commission-free-retail-crypto-trading-for-bitcoin-and-ether/">retail bitcoin and ether trading</a>. However, its subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets has been offering bitcoin services to institutional investors for several years and recently began offering <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelitys-crypto-platform-prepares-to-start-offering-ethereum-trading-next-week/">ether trading</a>. The firm published a report earlier this year, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-future-of-crypto-ecosystem-bitcoin-superior-form-of-money/">stating</a>: &#8220;Bitcoin&#8217;s first technological breakthrough was not as a superior payment technology but as a superior form of money. As a monetary good, bitcoin is unique.&#8221;</p>
<p>A growing number of big corporations are filing cryptocurrency and metaverse-related trademark applications with the USPTO. This month, banking giant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/banking-giant-hsbc-files-trademarks-for-a-wide-range-of-digital-currency-and-metaverse-products/">HSBC</a> filed trademark applications for a range of digital currency and metaverse products. In October, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/visa-files-trademark-applications-covering-a-range-of-cryptocurrency-products-including-crypto-wallet/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Visa</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-and-western-union-file-trademarks-for-wide-range-of-crypto-services/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Paypal, and Western Union</a> similarly filed crypto-related trademark applications. Last month, JPMorgan Chase was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-granted-wallet-trademark-covering-various-virtual-currency-and-crypto-payment-services/" target="_self" rel="noopener">granted</a> a wallet trademark covering various virtual currency and payment services.</p>
