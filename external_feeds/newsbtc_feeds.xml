					<description><![CDATA[In the latest development surrounding Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, the company has officially canceled its registration in the United Kingdom. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved Binance&#8217;s request to deregister Binance Markets Limited (BML) (BML) on May 30, 2023, effectively ending its authorization to provide regulated services in the country. While the termination of Binance&#8217;s registration with the FCA may seem significant, it will not impact the exchange&#8217;s operations as BML never conducted any business or had users in the UK. Ilir Laro, Binance&#8217;s sub-regional manager for growth in the UK and Europe, clarified that BML had remained dormant since its acquisition by Binance Group in 2020 and had not engaged in any regulated activities.

According to data from Kaiko, the exchange previously held a dominant position in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume denominated in Sterling until it lost its banking partner. Laro stated, &#8220;BML was successfully acquired back in 2020 by Binance Group, intended to launch a regulated business in the UK. This attempt was not successful, however, and has since then remained dormant since its acquisition.&#8221; Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance Faces Regulatory Hurdles Binance&#8217;s decision to exit the UK comes amid a series of regulatory challenges faced by the cryptocurrency exchange. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have both filed lawsuits against Binance, alleging various violations, including misleading practices and manipulative trading.

					<description><![CDATA[While PEPE is down 78% from its May 2023 peaks, token holders continue to rise. As of June 19, there are now 119,229 unique addresses holding the token, an increase from early June, Etherscan data shows.   The meme token is based on Pepe the Frog meme, created by Matt Furie in 2005.  Falling Prices, Rising Token Holder Count The token gained substantial recognition as a meme coin and enjoyed exponential price growth a month after launching in late April 2023.  With surging prices and the meme coin culture providing tailwinds, the token soon rose higher in the market cap ranking, securing a position in the top 100.  Related Reading: Stablecoins Supply Finally Shows Rise, Here’s Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin As of June 19, PEPE is perched at 89th position with a market cap of $364,936,703, according to CoinMarketCap. PEPE is down 78% from May 2023 peaks, and prices remain fragile.  Despite falling prices, PEPE holders continue to maintain an upward trend. With over 119,000 holders, users appear keen on accumulating. In crypto circles, token holder count can be used to measure interest and adoption. Projects with a higher token holder count can be used to indicate strong community support, which can translate to success. It can also indicate the level of utility and adoption. Tokens like USDT, a stablecoin, have high token holder counts considering their role in decentralized finance (DeFi), remittance, and more.  In the case of PEPE, token holders are mostly speculating because the coin has no utility but is deflationary. An extract from their homepage reads:  PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only. PEPE is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and can be bought on platforms like Binance, KuCoin, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, and others.

As of June 19, there are now 119,229 unique addresses holding the token, an increase from early June, Etherscan data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933?a=0x1497ebd1ed721dd7b2dc12768545558933df82fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shows</a>.  </p>
<p>The meme token is based on Pepe the Frog meme, created by Matt Furie in 2005. </p>
<h2><strong>Falling Prices, Rising Token Holder Count</strong></h2>
<p>The token gained substantial recognition as a meme coin and enjoyed exponential price growth a month after launching in late April 2023. </p>
<p>With surging prices and the meme coin culture providing tailwinds, the token soon rose higher in the market cap ranking, securing a position in the top 100. </p>

<p>As of June 19, PEPE is <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">perched</a> at 89th position with a market cap of $364,936,703, according to CoinMarketCap. PEPE is down 78% from May 2023 peaks, and prices remain fragile. </p>

<p>Despite falling prices, PEPE holders continue to maintain an upward trend. With over 119,000 holders, users appear keen on accumulating.</p>
<p>In crypto circles, token holder count can be used to measure interest and adoption. Projects with a higher token holder count can be used to indicate strong community support, which can translate to success.</p>
<p>It can also indicate the level of utility and adoption. Tokens like USDT, a stablecoin, have high token holder counts considering their role in decentralized finance (DeFi), remittance, and more. </p>
<p>In the case of PEPE, token holders are mostly speculating because the coin has no utility but is deflationary. An extract from their homepage<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.pepe.vip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> reads</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, could be on the cusp of a significant operational shift. In the latest Ethereum core developer consensus meeting, a key agenda item under discussion was a proposed increase in the maximum validator limit. If implemented, this adjustment would see the limit skyrocket from the current 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH per validator. Currently, validators in Ethereum&#8217;s network maintain a balance cap set at both the minimum and maximum of 32 ETH. Those managing large-scale staking operations, consequently, must establish multiple validators to earn yield beyond this limit. As such, the result is a significant growth in the number of validators, with the current count reaching 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 on standby. Streamlining For Optimization Michael Neuder, an Ethereum Foundation researcher and a primary advocate of this change, argues that the proposed increase would alleviate the pressures caused by the expanding validator set size. Related Reading: Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively Neuder highlighted that the current validator cap does support decentralization, but it simultaneously leads to an inflation of the validator set size. This increasing size eventually enhances the system&#8217;s performance by expediting the conclusion within a solitary Ethereum slot. In addition, Neuder pointed out the prospect of auto-compounding validator rewards brought on by this change. Given the current restrictions, any rewards earned beyond the 32 ETH cap must be averted to other places to generate any staking yield. With a raised cap, these rewards could be compounded instantaneously, enabling validators to reap greater benefits from their staked ETH. Impact On Large-Scale Operators And Associated Risks The proposal also aims to address the procedural challenges encountered by major node managers, such as exchanges like Coinbase, that presently supervise multitudes of validators due to the standing 32 ETH constraint per validator. If the cap were to be elevated, such operators could manage fewer validators with higher stakes, which could potentially simplify operations. However, Neuder cautioned about the risks tied to this proposed change. For instance, the increase could potentially lead to steeper penalties for inadvertent double attestations or proposals, also known as &#8220;slashing.&#8221; This highlights the importance of considering all possible implications in the path toward improving network efficiency and validator rewards. Notably, as Ethereum continues to evolve, this potential change in the validator limit serves as a critical discussion point in the broader conversation about the platform&#8217;s future.

At the time of writing, ETH trades above $1,700 after moving below that price range to trade at the $1,600 region last week. ETH&#8217;s trading volume has plummeted over the past 7 days from above $7 billion last Monday to below $4 billion in the past 24 hours, indicating a decline in trading activity.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin price has sank recently along with the greater crypto market, despite not being named a security by the US SEC. The downward pressure has the altcoin at risk of forming a death cross on the daily timeframe. Although the signal sounds ominous and often indicates a downtrend is coming, it might not be lights out for LTC after all. Let&#8217;s take a look. Lackluster Litecoin Performance Ahead of Halving Attributed to SEC With Litecoin&#8217;s halving just weeks away, the currently eleventh-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap was expected to perform better than it has. Fundamental and technical signals both point to LTC being undervalued, yet the coin has suffered alongside other altcoins from SEC-related sell pressure. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Could Be Gearing Up For Its Greatest Rally Since 2017 The US SEC is trying to kill the crypto industry, and its causing LTCUSD daily charts to inch closer to an ominous death cross. Its this a valid breakout of the downtrend line? &#124; LTCUSD on TradingView.com Doing A Double-Take On The Daily LTCUSD Death Cross A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average from above. This is considered a sell signal in a moving average-based trading system, and often precedes a negative trend change. But not always. A closer look at the 2020 death cross into golden cross &#124; LTCUSD on TradingView.com The chart above shows an example of a previous death cross from late 2020, which immediately rolled into a golden cross as soon as Litecoin found some support and started rising again. LTCUSD went on a massive rally lasting several weeks of upside. For this situation to repeat, Litecoin absolutely has to recover from current levels and resume its formerly bullish momentum. Otherwise, a death cross could lead to renewed selling from investors who expected more out of the halving. Related Reading: Litecoin Attempts To Revitalize The Crypto Market With Bullish Breakout Death cross and golden crosses can sometimes trigger back and forth in a choppy market, which is a drawback of using moving averages as trading signals. This is due to volatile price action pulling the faster moving average back and forth through the slower moving average. Furthermore, as an average of price action, moving averages are lagging indicators in general. A golden cross must be left on the chart when the all the consolidation ends, otherwise the looming death cross signal could have truly deadly implications. With Litecoin&#8217;s halving scheduled for under 45 days from now, anything is possible. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) is currently consolidating above the crucial $26,000 level, a key threshold for the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency to continue its upward momentum and reach higher levels.  The recovery of this price mark on June 15th has given BTC holders renewed confidence, with the highly anticipated news of Blackrock, the largest fund manager in the world with over $10 trillion under its management, announcing a formal application for a new spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has further boosted their optimism. Despite this positive news, Bitcoin still faces significant resistance ahead if it is to recover previously lost territories and solidify a bull run. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Already Bottomed, Sets Halving Price Higher Low At $25,800 Before Upside Breakout? Crypto analyst WoeToe has recently shared his thoughts on the current state of the Bitcoin market, highlighting a crucial level that bulls should keep an eye on. According to WoeToe, Bitcoin has failed to break its resistance level at $26,600, indicating that the market may be experiencing a period of consolidation before making its next move. WoeToe believes that BTC may set a higher low around the $25,800 level before breaking out of its current channel to the upside, as indicated by the yellow lines on the chart. This means that if Bitcoin were to drop to $25,800, it would be a critical level for bulls to defend to maintain bullish momentum. Therefore, bulls must hold the $25,800 mark and prevent a drop below it. If Bitcoin successfully sets a higher low at this level and breaks out of its current channel, it could potentially open up new resistance levels and lead to a bullish trend in the market. However, if bulls fail to defend the potential higher low at $25,800, Bitcoin could experience a further downtrend. In this scenario, the cryptocurrency may test its strongest support floor, indicated by its 200-day Moving Average (MA), currently at $25,200.  The 200-day MA has previously prevented Bitcoin from extending its downtrend since last week&#8217;s weekly opening. Bitcoin Downside Risk Increases Cryptocurrency trader Rekt Capital has warned Bitcoin investors, stating that the leading cryptocurrency has rallied straight into the 200-week Moving Average, which could act as new resistance and potentially trigger a two-step breakdown confirmation. This, in turn, could lead to further downside for Bitcoin shortly. The 200-week MA is a widely-watched technical indicator that reflects the average price of Bitcoin over the past 200 weeks. It is considered a significant support level and has historically acted as a key price point for the cryptocurrency.

This would mean that the cryptocurrency would break through two key support levels quickly, potentially signaling a significant shift in market sentiment and leading to further downside. Bitcoin has made multiple attempts to break through the $26,600 resistance level but has been unsuccessful. The cryptocurrency is trading at $26,400 and has yet to surpass the critical resistance mark. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-538614" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot_57-860x472.jpg" alt="Bitcoin " width="860" height="472" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot_57-860x472.jpg 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot_57-460x253.jpg 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot_57-768x422.jpg 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot_57-750x412.jpg 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot_57.jpg 949w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"/>
<p>WoeToe believes that BTC may set a higher low around the $25,800 level before breaking out of its current channel to the upside, as indicated by the yellow lines on the chart. This means that if Bitcoin were to drop to $25,800, it would be a critical level for bulls to defend to maintain bullish momentum.</p>
<p>Therefore, bulls must hold the $25,800 mark and prevent a drop below it. If Bitcoin successfully sets a higher low at this level and breaks out of its current channel, it could potentially open up new resistance levels and lead to a bullish trend in the market.</p>
<p>However, if bulls fail to defend the potential higher low at $25,800, Bitcoin could experience a further downtrend. In this scenario, the cryptocurrency may test its strongest support floor, indicated by its 200-day Moving Average (MA), currently at $25,200. </p>
<p>The 200-day MA has previously prevented Bitcoin from extending its downtrend since last week&#8217;s weekly opening.</p>
Bitcoin Downside Risk Increases
<p>Cryptocurrency trader Rekt Capital has <a href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1670490269878239232?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">warned</a><a href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1670490269878239232?s=20" rel="nofollow"> </a>Bitcoin investors, stating that the leading cryptocurrency has rallied straight into the 200-week Moving Average, which could act as new resistance and potentially trigger a two-step breakdown confirmation. This, in turn, could lead to further downside for Bitcoin shortly.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-538615" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8-860x609.jpg" alt="Bitcoin " width="860" height="609" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8-860x609.jpg 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8-460x326.jpg 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8-768x544.jpg 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8-1536x1088.jpg 1536w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8-120x86.jpg 120w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8-750x531.jpg 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8-1140x807.jpg 1140w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fy7F1CQWwAAJ7t8.jpg 1788w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"/>
<p>The 200-week MA is a widely-watched technical indicator that reflects the average price of Bitcoin over the past 200 weeks. It is considered a significant support level and has historically acted as a key price point for the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>However, if BCT fails to break through the 200-week MA and instead turns it into new resistance, it could lead to a two-step breakdown confirmation. This would mean that the cryptocurrency would break through two key support levels quickly, potentially signaling a significant shift in market sentiment and leading to further downside.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/57KuzSgc/" alt="Bitcoin " width="1814" height="858"/>
<p>Bitcoin has made multiple attempts to break through the $26,600 resistance level but has been unsuccessful. The cryptocurrency is trading at $26,400 and has yet to surpass the critical resistance mark.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Bitcoin short-term holders have participated in buying recently despite the price briefly dropping below their cost basis. Bitcoin Has Rebounded Back Above Short-Term Holder Realized Price As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC price had recently fallen below the realized price of the short-term holders. The &#8220;realized price&#8221; here refers to a metric that&#8217;s derived from the &#8220;realized cap.&#8221; The realized cap is a popular capitalization model for Bitcoin that assumes that the true value of each coin in circulation is not the current spot price, but the price at which it was last moved/sold on the blockchain. When this cap is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the &#8220;realized price&#8221; emerges. The significance of this indicator is that it represents the cost basis of the average investor in the market. In the context of the current discussion, the average acquisition price of the entire market isn&#8217;t of interest, however; the realized price for only a segment of the market is relevant: the short-term holders. The &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs) here refer to investors who bought their coins less than 155 days ago. These investors are generally fickle and their behavior has historically been relevant to the trend BTC has followed. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH realized price over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been near the spot price recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant The STH realized price has historically displayed some interesting interactions with the spot price of Bitcoin. During bearish periods, the metric has provided resistance to the price, while in bullish trends, it has switched its role to being a support level. Both these patterns are also visible in the above graph, where the cryptocurrency saw a negative reaction to the line around the time of the November 2022 FTX collapse, while it found support at it when the rally had taken a step back in March 2023. As for why this pattern exists at all, the reason likely lies in the fact that the STHs look at their cost basis differently depending on the wider trend being followed in the market at the time. During bear markets, the investors look at their acquisition price as a chance to escape. They believe that selling at their cost basis would at least mean that they can avoid taking losses. It&#8217;s this selling that becomes the source of resistance at the line. Related Reading: Ethereum Cancun Upgrade: Why Arbitrum, Optimism Will Profit Massively In rallies, on the other hand, the STHs generally hold a bullish sentiment. They look at their cost basis as a profitable buying opportunity, as they think that the price would go up in the near future. The mass buying when the price touches the line may explain why the asset has observed rebounds here. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that Bitcoin had recently dipped slightly under this line, raising concerns about whether the bullish regime had come to an end. In the past few days, however, the asset has been able to regain itself back above the level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Steadies Above $26K, Can Bulls Pump It Further?

					<description><![CDATA[According to a Reuters report, Crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon, the former CEO of Terraform Labs, has been sentenced to four months in prison by a court in Montenegro for allegedly using forged passports.  Crypto Mogul Faces Jail Time For Passport Forgery Kwon, who is charged with multibillion-dollar fraud in the United States and is wanted by South Korean authorities on similar charges, was detained in March along with Han Chang-Joon, the former finance officer of Terraform Labs, as they attempted to board a flight to Dubai at the airport in Montenegro&#8217;s capital, Podgorica. Both men were charged with forging official documents. Related Reading: Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Tallies 22% In Last Week, Will It Test $1 Mark? Kwon had argued that he believed the Costa Rican passport was a legitimate &#8220;golden passport&#8221; available to wealthy applicants seeking fast-track citizenship in certain countries. However, the court rejected this explanation and handed down the prison sentences. The case has attracted widespread media attention, as Kwon is wanted by US and South Korean authorities on fraud charges related to the collapse of Terra last May. The company&#8217;s collapse led to over $60 billion in losses and sparked investigations into Kwon&#8217;s activities. As Bloomberg reported on June 8th, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon may face multiple jail terms in different countries, according to senior South Korean prosecutor Dan Sunghan.  During an interaction with Bloomberg, Sunghan stated that South Korea had conducted most of the foundational investigation into the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and had more evidence on the matter than US authorities. Related Reading: US Politician Cheers Shiba Inu Price Surge, But Trend Reversal Still Pending Sunghan believes that carrying out the investigation and trial of Kwon in South Korea is the most efficient approach to getting justice. He also suggested that Kwon could face jail sentences for different charges in two separate countries, in addition to the recent decision by Montenegro&#8217;s court.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>Kwon had argued that he believed the Costa Rican passport was a legitimate &#8220;golden passport&#8221; available to wealthy applicants seeking fast-track citizenship in certain countries. However, the court rejected this explanation and handed down the prison sentences.</p>
<p>The case has attracted widespread media attention, as Kwon is wanted by US and South Korean authorities on fraud charges related to the collapse of Terra last May. The company&#8217;s collapse led to over $60 billion in losses and sparked investigations into Kwon&#8217;s activities.</p>
<p>As Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-08/fallen-crypto-mogul-kwon-could-face-jail-in-south-korea-and-us-prosecutor-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported </a>on June 8th, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon may face multiple jail terms in different countries, according to senior South Korean prosecutor Dan Sunghan. </p>
<p>During an interaction with Bloomberg, Sunghan stated that South Korea had conducted most of the foundational investigation into the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and had more evidence on the matter than US authorities.</p>



<p>Sunghan believes that carrying out the investigation and trial of Kwon in South Korea is the most efficient approach to getting justice. He also suggested that Kwon could face jail sentences for different charges in two separate countries, in addition to the recent decision by Montenegro&#8217;s court. </p>
