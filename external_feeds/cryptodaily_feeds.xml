			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">The highly anticipated full launch of the Ninja Warriors Meta blockchain game is set to take place in Q4 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">However, before this groundbreaking release, the platform launched its second presale, where for every USDT invested, the user receives 66.6666667 NWT. NWT is the native token of the Ninja Warriors Meta gaming platform.</p>
Ninja Warriors Meta's Presale&nbsp;
<p class="s3">In line with the project's roadmap, the NWT presale is already underway before the full launch of Ninja Warrior Meta's blockchain gaming platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The NWT token is the native token and core of the Ninja Warrior Meta ecosystem. Thus, the presale allows gamers to acquire NWT tokens at a discounted price before the general publicif they intend to fully participate in the full game mode upon launch at the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The minimum investment amount is 100 USDT, while whales can only buy a maximum of 100,000 USDT. All investors must submit personal details as part of the know-your-customer (KYC) procedure.</p>
<p class="s3">It would also allow gamers and investors to enjoy a share in future developments, enhanced gameplay, immersive game modes, rewards, and an expanded gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s3">The roadmap showcases a clear vision for exponential growth, and the team behind Ninja Warriors Meta is committed to continuous development and strategic partnerships with industry leaders.</p>
<p class="s3">To fund the project's roadmap and ensure widespread adoption and awareness, the NWT presale allows Ninja Warrior Meta to run a dedicated branding phase utilizing organic traffic generation on social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The focus would be expanding the Ninja Warrior Meta community, including captivating press releases, team interviews, and strategic campaigns.</p>
<p class="s3">The presale goes beyond promoting the Ninja Warrior Meta blockchain game through engaging storytelling and content like videos and gameplay showcases.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Notably, it facilitates gathering like-minded crypto game participants, influential figures, and investors, immersing them in Ninja Warriors Meta.</p>
<p class="s3">Moreover,&nbsp; Ninja Warriors Meta is set to release a move-to-earn (M2E) application for Android and iOS platforms in two months. This application offers users the opportunity to accumulate points through physical activities, including gym visits and diverse movements. These points can be exchanged for DBUSD tokens.</p>
Full-game Launch
<p class="s3">Amid the ongoing NWT presale, since Q3 2022, gaming enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting the announcement of Ninja Warriors Meta's full-game platform. The game is set for launch in Q4 2023.</p>

<p class="s3">Players would need to get a Ninja Warriors membership to fully participate in all game modes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Players that obtain a low-cost monthly subscription are set to receive a free non-fungible token (NFT) character that allows its owner to enter the Ninja Warrior Meta ecosystem and start playing, earning, and progressing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Since the Ninja Warrior Meta game would launch on Polygon's layer-2 blockchain, players would also need to set up a MATIC-compatible wallet and fund said wallet with sufficient MATIC for transaction gas fees.</p>
<p class="s3">Players would also expect to earn as they play, covering whatever initial costs were incurred during gameplay. For that reason, Ninja Warriors Meta incorporates an in-game rewards system designed to be fair and sustainable.</p>
Conclusion
<p class="s3">The presale launch would position Ninja Warrior Meta as a worthy player in the blockchain gaming industry by funding its growth, continuous development, and strategic partnerships necessary for the game to flourish.</p>
<p class="s3">With its focus on blockchain technology and the potential of play-to-earn gaming, Ninja Warriors Meta's full-game launch would captivate individuals, enticing them to join the revolutionary blockchain gaming experience.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Tether, the issuer of USDT, the world&rsquo;s largest stablecoin, has minted the second 1 billion token on the Ethereum blockchain in less than two months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stablecoin issuer has said that the new mint is part of its "inventory replenish" program to ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains. In other crypto developments, Tradecurve has been building momentum as investors flock to the new trading platform that has the potential to rekindle interest in the DeFi space.</p>
<p></p>
Tether Mints Additional 1 Billion USDT
<p>Tether&rsquo;s treasury has announced the minting of 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain just two months after a separate 1 billion USDT token was minted. So far in 2023, the stablecoin issuer has now minted over $16 billion worth of USDT tokens. Tether remains the most dominant USD-pegged stablecoin with a market cap of $83 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Announcing the latest mint, Tether&rsquo;s CTO Paolo Ardoino, explained that the tokens were minted for chain swap and not due to a rising interest in the purchase of digital assets. Chain swap refers to the process of sending digital assets (in this case USDT) from one blockchain network to another &ndash; bridging assets across multiple blockchains.</p>
<p>After the mint, on-chain data showed that Tether&rsquo;s Treasury sent $750 million worth of USDT in a chain swap transaction to Binance. According to Arkham Intelligence, the popular blockchain analytical firm, the Tether Treasury sent the funds in three separate batches of $250 million transactions after an initial $10 test transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analytical firm later reported that of the $1 billion new tokens minted, only $146 million remains on the Ethereum blockchain as the others have been swapped for USDT on other chains.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Price Set to Hit $0.018
<p>Along with the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin sectors, Tradecurve has enjoyed increasing attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Tradecurve is building the first DeFi platform where its users will have the opportunity to trade both cryptocurrencies and derivatives (like stocks, forex, options, and commodities) from a single account.</p>
<p>Experts are bullish that the price of Tradecurve (TCRV) could easily jump above its current $0.018 price because of the magnitude of the derivatives markets. The Bank for International Settlements reports that in June 2022, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market rose to $632 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bullish predictions for the price of Tradecurve come from the platform&rsquo;s potential to connect the crypto market with the global derivatives market.</p>
<p>Experts believe the Tradecurve platform could rekindle interest in the DeFi space as crypto traders would no longer need to open more than one account to trade global financial instruments. As more traders enter into the Tradecurve ecosystem, experts predict that the price of TCRV could jump from $0.018 to as high as $1.5 by the end of 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Reports indicate that the Venezuelan government may be shutting down its national cryptocurrency, the petro. </p>
<p>The government of Venezuela could be winding down its petro cryptocurrency after members of Sunacrip, the country&rsquo;s crypto watchdog, were found to be involved in a corruption scheme.</p>
<p>Reports by Bloomberg Linea indicate that it could be the end of Venezuela&rsquo;s national oil-backed cryptocurrency, the petro. Three persons linked with the country&rsquo;s crypto regulator said the petro would be liquidated five years after issuance.</p>
<p>Bitcoin.com first shared the news and reported that the decision was made as part of Sunacrip&rsquo;s restructuring. The decision reportedly also includes liquidating the debts contracted with big petro holders, including department stores that decided to accept petro as a payment method.</p>
<p>The decision to restructure Sunacrip came after its head Joselit Ramirez was arrested in March on corruption charges. Venezuelan president Nicolas Madura removed Ramirez from his position for allegedly participating in a plan to steal from the country&rsquo;s oil operations.</p>
<p>Soon after news of Ramirez&rsquo;s alleged involvement in corruption came to light, energy suppliers across the country shut down various crypto-mining operations. Local media reports and&nbsp;tweets&nbsp;from Venezuela&rsquo;s National Association of Cryptocurrencies indicate that crypto mining facilities were shut down in the states of Carabobo, Bolivar, and Lara. Numerous crypto exchanges were also&nbsp;ordered&nbsp;to cease their activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The petro was introduced in 2018 as a way to sidestep sanctions imposed by the Trump and Obama administrations and has largely been viewed as a failure. The introduction of an oil-backed national crypto was met with scepticism from global leaders, and former US president Donald Trump banned US investors from trading in petro.</p>
<p>Introduced amid a financial crisis, Venezuela no longer lists the petro as a currency. When introducing the petro, the Maduro administration permitted several crypto exchanges to operate in the country, introducing Venezuelans to cryptocurrencies as an alternative to their declining currency.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Do Kwon has been sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro district court for forging travel documents. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that a Montenegrin Basic Court in the country&rsquo;s capital of Podgorica sentenced Do Kwon and his associate Han Chang-Joon to four months in jail for forging travel documents. The infamous co-founder of the collapsed Terraform Labs was arrested in March in Podgorica, where he was found attempting to travel to Dubai with a forged passport.</p>
<p>Kwon and Joon were found guilty of forgery charges, and two Costa Rican and Belgian passports and two identity cards belonging to Kwon and Joon were confiscated. A Basic Court in Podgorica shared the verdict on Monday and said the pair&rsquo;s time spent in detention would be included in their sentence.</p>
<p>The duo have been in custody despite being released on bail early in June.</p>
Do Kwon: An Internationally Wanted Man
<p>Kwon is a South Korean national who stands accused on charges of multibillion-dollar fraud related to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022. Terraform&rsquo;s algorithmic stablecoin and crypto project Terra-Luna collapsed, wiping out $40 billion in market cap and sending the overall crypto market into a spiral.</p>
<p>Following Terra&rsquo;s collapse, South Korean authorities charged Kwon in September for violating its Capital Markets Act and issued a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) accordingly issued a red notice for Kwon, signalling international law enforcement agencies to track him down and arrest him on charges of fraud.</p>
<p>US Federal prosecutors further indicted Kwon with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Both South Korea and the US are seeking Kwon&rsquo;s extradition.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Sydney-based crypto exchange is eyeing an expansion to Hong Kong in the &ldquo;next few months&rdquo; according to an interview with Lasanka Perera, the CEO of its Singapore operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Having had a solid foundation in Singapore for the past decade, Perera says that the firm is now looking for other hubs and is currently applying for a license to operate in Hong Kong. Perera cited Hong Kong&rsquo;s advantage as an &ldquo;active financial hub with deep capital markets.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Towards the end of October last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) enacted an overhaul on its crypto regulations which introduced tighter restrictions and discouraged retail trading. Perera commented on how these restrictions caused a significant drop in Independent Reserve&rsquo;s business, forcing the exchange to focus more on wealth management and Web3 payment segments. Perera also notes the conservatism </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Around the same time, Hong Kong announced an easing up on its regulations, culminating in the announcement just last March of an open regulatory framework which took effect this June. This new framework encouraged the adoption of digital assets while protecting its users from crises in the sector and is expected to foster the development and growth of the digital asset market.</p>
Regulatory Shifts Impacting Market Strategies
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The stricter regulatory environment imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in October last year has served as a critical inflection point for crypto firms like Independent Reserve. The introduction of tighter constraints on cryptocurrency trading, particularly discouraging retail trading, had a significant impact on Independent Reserve's business, causing a marked drop in trading activity.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In contrast, Hong Kong has welcomed digital assets with more liberal regulatory practices, a move that Independent Reserve sees as an opportunity for expansion. Hong Kong's open regulatory framework, enacted this June, aims to foster digital asset adoption while providing user protection. This proactive, balanced approach to digital asset regulation makes Hong Kong an attractive market for crypto companies seeking a more welcoming regulatory climate.</p>
Eyeing Expansion Beyond Asia
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Independent Reserve's expansion strategy does not stop in Asia. The firm is also setting sights further afield, notably towards Dubai. Perera highlights that stepping into Dubai would potentially open up pathways to affluent European markets and capital. This strategic move underscores the firm's ambition to become a truly global player in the digital asset space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the key to successful market entry hinges on Dubai adopting sensible and supportive regulations for crypto exchanges. Independent Reserve's leadership is watching regulatory developments closely as they form the backbone of their growth strategy. As the firm plans its next steps, observers are waiting to see how these international expansions will reshape the broader crypto landscape.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Hong Kong is well on its way to becoming a crypto hub in Southeast Asia and observers will take note of the way this relates to China&rsquo;s crypto policies as a whole; Perera himself has noted how Hong Kong is &ldquo;the doorway to [greater] China&rdquo;. And of course, one will have to take note how this squares with the especially dire state of the cryptocurrency sector in the United States.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Towards the end of October last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) enacted an overhaul on its crypto regulations which introduced tighter restrictions and discouraged retail trading. Perera commented on how these restrictions caused a significant drop in Independent Reserve&rsquo;s business, forcing the exchange to focus more on wealth management and Web3 payment segments. Perera also notes the conservatism </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Around the same time, Hong Kong announced an easing up on its regulations, culminating in the announcement just last March of an open regulatory framework which took effect this June. This new framework encouraged the adoption of digital assets while protecting its users from crises in the sector and is expected to foster the development and growth of the digital asset market.</p>
Regulatory Shifts Impacting Market Strategies
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The stricter regulatory environment imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in October last year has served as a critical inflection point for crypto firms like Independent Reserve. The introduction of tighter constraints on cryptocurrency trading, particularly discouraging retail trading, had a significant impact on Independent Reserve's business, causing a marked drop in trading activity.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In contrast, Hong Kong has welcomed digital assets with more liberal regulatory practices, a move that Independent Reserve sees as an opportunity for expansion. Hong Kong's open regulatory framework, enacted this June, aims to foster digital asset adoption while providing user protection. This proactive, balanced approach to digital asset regulation makes Hong Kong an attractive market for crypto companies seeking a more welcoming regulatory climate.</p>
Eyeing Expansion Beyond Asia
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Independent Reserve's expansion strategy does not stop in Asia. The firm is also setting sights further afield, notably towards Dubai. Perera highlights that stepping into Dubai would potentially open up pathways to affluent European markets and capital. This strategic move underscores the firm's ambition to become a truly global player in the digital asset space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the key to successful market entry hinges on Dubai adopting sensible and supportive regulations for crypto exchanges. Independent Reserve's leadership is watching regulatory developments closely as they form the backbone of their growth strategy. As the firm plans its next steps, observers are waiting to see how these international expansions will reshape the broader crypto landscape.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Hong Kong is well on its way to becoming a crypto hub in Southeast Asia and observers will take note of the way this relates to China&rsquo;s crypto policies as a whole; Perera himself has noted how Hong Kong is &ldquo;the doorway to [greater] China&rdquo;. And of course, one will have to take note how this squares with the especially dire state of the cryptocurrency sector in the United States.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a recent uproar within the crypto Twitter community, the popular AI bot "Explain This Bob" found its account suspended. This action followed an accusation by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who identified it as a "scam crypto account."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Interestingly, the bot was intrinsically linked to the ERC-20 memecoin, Bob Token (BOB), whose price spiraled downward by over 30% in the aftermath of the suspension, clearly indicating the real-world repercussions of such allegations.</p>
Suspension of 'Explain This Bob' Sparks Controversy
<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Explain This Bob," an AI-powered bot engineered by Prabhu Biswal from India, employed OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4 model to decipher and respond to tweets associated with its account. Garnering over 400,000 followers before its suspension, the bot held substantial influence within the platform. Bob Token, launched in April and directly connected with the bot, even caught the attention of Musk earlier on, who had tweeted, &ldquo;I love Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Twitter's decision to spare the Bob Token's account while suspending the bot reveals a discernible separation between the suspected irregularities associated with the bot and the perceived legitimacy of the linked crypto token. Following the suspension, the Bob Token project team responded with a humorous meme depicting Musk keeping an eye on a distressed &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; in prison.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The subsequent rallying of the Twitter community behind the Bob Token, with widespread circulation of the hashtag &ldquo;FREEBOB&rdquo;, testifies to the bot's popularity. Supporters have vociferously argued against BOB being labelled a scam coin, asserting that the token's launch was conducted fairly, it operates on a fully decentralized mechanism, and features a 0% tax system.</p>
Twitter and Crypto: A Complex Duo
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Twitter's controversial suspension of 'Explain This Bob' is a snapshot of the platform's intricate dance with the world of cryptocurrencies. Serving as an influential social media platform, Twitter wields a strong hand in sculpting the crypto narrative and can sway token values significantly. This is apparent from the instant depreciation of the Bob Token's value following the suspension of the associated bot.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Twitter's association with cryptocurrencies runs deep, with ex-CEO Jack Dorsey being an outspoken Bitcoin advocate, and the platform recently integrating Bitcoin as a tipping feature. Yet, this association has faced hurdles, with the platform being leveraged for spreading misinformation, initiating scams, and organizing 'pump and dump' schemes. Striking a balance between promoting discussions around cryptocurrencies and ensuring user safety from potential scams has therefore become a daunting task for Twitter.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of the last available data in September 2021, Twitter boasts over 330 million active users, with a significant portion being active participants in the crypto community. This statistic reflects the platform's integral role in driving substantial movements within cryptocurrency markets, especially when high-profile figures like Elon Musk are involved.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Twitter's relationship with cryptocurrencies is indeed a delicate dance. While the platform presents an indispensable medium for disseminating crypto-related news and fostering dialogue, it also grapples with ensuring its user base remains safeguarded from potential scams and misinformation. In this sense, the crypto industry also needs to acknowledge the role of social media platforms such as Twitter is likely to become increasingly complex and significant.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ethereum users are being given a fresh way to create nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets on the blockchain following the launch of a new protocol called "Ethscriptions."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Launched on June 17 by music website Genius.com's co-founder Tom Lehman, Ethscriptions aims to revolutionize Ethereum-based digital asset creation and was quickly met with a high degree of enthusiasm, generating almost 30,000 Ethscriptions within the first 18 hours.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Taking inspiration from the popular Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals protocol &mdash; where assets are known as &ldquo;inscriptions&rdquo; &mdash; Ethscriptions promises to enhance the way digital assets are minted on the Ethereum network. </p>
The Protocol: Leveraging Ethereum's Calldata for Improved Minting
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Lehman, who is also known by the pseudonym Middlemarch on Twitter, declared the project a "huge success." Ethscriptions employs Ethereum's "calldata," which refers to the data held within a smart contract, to allow for a "cheaper" and "more decentralized" minting process compared to conventional smart contract-based methods.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At present, the protocol limits users to image-only inscriptions, but Lehman assures that Ethscriptions will accommodate different file types in the future. Current protocol specifications permit users to "ethscribe" any image provided it's less than 96 kilobytes in size.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Lehman&rsquo;s first project on the Ethscriptions protocol, the "Ethereum Punks," witnessed a significantly positive response from the community. All 10,000 assets were claimed almost instantaneously, reinforcing the positive acceptance of the protocol by the community.</p>
Challenges and Potential: Navigating the Ethereum Ecosystem
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the initial success, the project's launch caused so much user activity that the API interface for the official Ethscriptions website temporarily crashed, indicating possible infrastructure challenges.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Given the existing infrastructure that enables the creation of NFTs and other digital assets on the Ethereum network, it remains uncertain whether Ethscriptions will achieve the same level of popularity as Bitcoin Ordinals. Within six months, the total number of Ordinals inscribed on Bitcoin skyrocketed from zero to 10 million, driven primarily by users' fascination with minting assets and the novelty of minting entirely new tokens through the BRC-20 token standard on the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of the Ethscriptions protocol on Ethereum presents a significant development for digital asset creation on the blockchain. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and innovate, and it becomes clearer over this period that initiatives like Ethscriptions could potentially introduce new dynamics and possibilities. While the immediate impact is promising, the long-term success of this novel approach to asset creation remains to be seen.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Poliant, ai private club designed especially for crypto users, has recently launched Follow the Whale, its main product. Follow the Whale is a platform that will significantly contribute to the crypto space by analyzing data and predicting important updates in the market.&nbsp;</p>
A Game Changer for the Crypto Space
<p>Poliant, a yearly founded crypto project, has just developed and launched its main product, Follow the Whale (FTWP). Follow the Whale Pool is an exclusive platform developed with the main goal of analyzing terabytes of data per second in order to anticipate crucial information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the Whale will be able to identify when a whale enters or exits the market of a cryptocurrency. The platform will achieve that by accessing large quantities of data in a very short time. The data will come from the market and exchanges in the form of data packages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By analyzing such data, Poliant and Follow the Whale aim to offer users valuable information, as well as provide additional information to AI (Artificial Intelligence) software, in order to help it act in the best way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, Follow the Whale will have one job - to follow the whale&rsquo;s signal. When a whale exit&nbsp; the market, the pool of Follow the Whale will go &ldquo;Short&rdquo;, while when a new whale enters the market, the system will go &ldquo;Buy&rdquo;. Thanks to this system, the team behind Follow the Whale can use whales&rsquo; market movements to generate rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the Whale can indeed contribute to the well-functioning of the crypto space, considering that it anticipates some events that can truly affect the crypto market. Besides, Poliant&rsquo;s focus on helping the AI industry can indeed increase the popularity of the crypto project and its main product, considering that artificial intelligence is fastly developing and gaining remarkable popularity with each day that passes.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poliant, ai private club designed especially for crypto users, has recently launched Follow the Whale, its main product. Follow the Whale is a platform that will significantly contribute to the crypto space by analyzing data and predicting important updates in the market.&nbsp;</p>
A Game Changer for the Crypto Space
<p>Poliant, a yearly founded crypto project, has just developed and launched its main product, Follow the Whale (FTWP). Follow the Whale Pool is an exclusive platform developed with the main goal of analyzing terabytes of data per second in order to anticipate crucial information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the Whale will be able to identify when a whale enters or exits the market of a cryptocurrency. The platform will achieve that by accessing large quantities of data in a very short time. The data will come from the market and exchanges in the form of data packages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By analyzing such data, Poliant and Follow the Whale aim to offer users valuable information, as well as provide additional information to AI (Artificial Intelligence) software, in order to help it act in the best way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, Follow the Whale will have one job - to follow the whale&rsquo;s signal. When a whale exit&nbsp; the market, the pool of Follow the Whale will go &ldquo;Short&rdquo;, while when a new whale enters the market, the system will go &ldquo;Buy&rdquo;. Thanks to this system, the team behind Follow the Whale can use whales&rsquo; market movements to generate rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the Whale can indeed contribute to the well-functioning of the crypto space, considering that it anticipates some events that can truly affect the crypto market. Besides, Poliant&rsquo;s focus on helping the AI industry can indeed increase the popularity of the crypto project and its main product, considering that artificial intelligence is fastly developing and gaining remarkable popularity with each day that passes.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>How the financial system works is bizarre beyond belief. Bitcoin is the life raft that provides unseizable wealth.</p>
How does one explain this monetary system?
<p>If an alien landed on earth and asked how the financial system worked, there is probably no economist who would be able to explain how such a complex and outlandish system actually functions.</p>
<p>The heart of the world&rsquo;s financial system is arguably the United States, and the Federal Reserve Bank. A bank that isn&rsquo;t federal and has no reserves. In fact, the Federal Reserve is a private bank, with all the big US banks helping to run it and being among the shareholders.</p>
<p>The alien might ask how on earth, or even in the galaxy, can a private bank run the financial affairs of the most powerful country in the world, and in turn influence the entire global monetary and banking system?</p>
<p>The answer might be that it just kind of happened. Edward Griffin's &ldquo;The creature from Jekyll Island&rdquo; does the best job in telling the story of how a group of extremely powerful bankers and politicians travelled to a little frequented destination and held a secret meeting on setting up a central bank with which to control the country&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>They were successful beyond belief and the bank endures to this day, with the world&rsquo;s financial markets completely in thrall whenever the Chairman of the Federal Reserve makes his utterances on what the central bank will do next.</p>
How has the system endured?
<p>Some might say that what it has already done is enough, as when President Nixon announced back in 1971 that the dollar would be removed from its gold backing, allowing the country to print currency with almost no restraint ever since then.</p>
<p>The alien could then ask how the dollar was able to keep its purchasing power, to say nothing of all the world&rsquo;s fiat currencies which were tied to it. Also, hard assets such as gold - wouldn&rsquo;t they rocket to the heavens?</p>
<p>The answer would be that the dollar has lost 99% of its purchasing power since it was established in 1914, just after the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gold has kept its purchasing power, as it has done throughout the history of the world and just continues to go up against the dollar despite the massive amount of manipulation that goes on in the paper futures exchanges such as the COMEX.</p>
<p>Finally the alien may ask how the population of the US and that of other countries hasn&rsquo;t risen up to protest the theft of purchasing power by the banks? The answer would be that the population is kept from discussing or hearing about how the financial system works, and this dearth of knowledge is throughout schools, colleges, and universities.</p>
How the story ends well
<p>However, the good news that could be told to the alien is that a decentralised hard money system has managed to grow under the radar of those in charge of the monetary system. It has spread across the world to become the most powerful and secure computer network that the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Its name is Bitcoin, and it provides wealth that cannot be taken away from the holder, not by force, nor by manipulation of central banks that drive the world&rsquo;s middle classes into poverty.</p>
<p>This is a story that can end well, and will perhaps leave the alien not feeling as sorry for us. Here is a world where an evil monetary system prevails, but where a gift in the form of Bitcoin can provide an exit out of the slavery that fiat currencies inflict.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Broadening its horizons and looking to increase its on-chain footprint, ChainGPT has begun its interchain movement by bridging the $CGPT token to the Ethereum Network.</p>
<p>Enabled through a partnership with ChainPort, KuCoin, BitGet, and other top-tier Web3 partners, ChainGPT has developed a decentralized bi-directional bridge between the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum for the $CGPT token. Now users will be able to transfer their $CGPT to and from the ETH and BNB/BSC networks seamlessly.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the bridge, the $CGPT token&rsquo;s on-chain presence expands, gaining access to the robust and vibrant ecology of the Ethereum network. Integrations into many of the world's leading DEFI protocols, the opening of token pools on DEXs, and the provision of added trading pairs against a broader segment of popular tokens becomes possible.</p>
What is $CGPT?
<p>At its core, $CGPT is enabling a decentralized economy for AI services. As the native token of the ChainGPT ecosystem, $CGPT serves the dual functions of a utility and governance tool. Its utility purpose is to provide access to a full suite of AI-powered Web3 tooling from NFT minting and community management to smart contract auditing and creation to launchpad tiering and beyond. Its governance function relates to the role of $CGPT in distributing ownership rights over the platform throughout its community members and giving them the opportunity to help steer the direction of the project&rsquo;s development. View the ChainGPT DAO here.</p>
Where will the ERC-20 version of $CGPT be supported?
<p>ChainGPT has been in communications with a multitude of exchanges that would be able to provide support immediately after instantiation. At this time, Kucoin, BitGet, and ByBit have confirmed support with a few select other major exchanges signaling their willingness.</p>
<p>On the front of decentralized venues for support, the most popular DEX in the world, UniSwap, will have a $CGPT token pool opened to provide instant listing and liquidity on Ethereum.</p>
<p>With the help of ChainPort, $CGPT&rsquo;s presence on major crypto directories and analytics portals including CoinGecko and Etherscan has been expedited.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the crypto market seemingly still in the grip of enforcement-induced fear perhaps Bitcoin is getting ready for an explosive move.</p>
Sideways and down
<p>The crypto market is relatively quiet, as altcoins continue their bleed out due to the highly uncertain regulatory atmosphere, and bitcoin is still moving sideways and down in a descending channel.</p>
<p>All quiet on the crypto front.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at times like these that investors should be studying the tea leaves and watching the stars with far more avidity than normal because a sudden upheaval in the market would likely catch many unawares, and there are increasing signs that something big could be about to commence.</p>
<p>With the SEC suing all and sundry, most retail investors have headed for the hills, convinced that they are not going to return until the outcomes from all of the enforcement actions are known, and it looks like it is safe to return.</p>
<p>However, this is not how money is made. It is well known that the best time to invest is when there is blood in the streets, and there must surely be some of the red stuff washing over the kerb right now.</p>
Major players moving in
<p>Big players are just getting ready to enter in the form of Blackrock and Fidelity and they don&rsquo;t get any bigger than this. Blackrock already filed its petition for a Bitcoin Spot ETF, and Fidelity is set to either file its own, or make a bid for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">UPDATE: @DigitalAssets and @Fidelity is about to make a seismic move in crypto via both $BTC and $ETH. Sources expect Fidelity to either make a bid for @Grayscale or quickly launch their own spot #bitcoin ETF. One or both are coming, soon. **Blackrock and Fidelity will own&hellip;</p>
&mdash; Andrew (@AP_Abacus) June 18, 2023
<p>

</p>
Juicy technicals
<p>Meanwhile, bitcoin is starting to look quite juicy from a technical chart perspective. A possible cup and handle is a long time in the making, with the cup starting in June of 2022, coming to a top last April, and now making its handle downwards. The measured move for this cup and handle could be in the region of $45,000.</p>
<p>On the 5-day time frame the price is holding nicely at the top of the Gaussian Channel, and on the weekly time frame the Stochastic RSI, a good momentum indicator, is coming down nicely, to be followed by a cross up perhaps in the next 2 to 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Of course, everything isn&rsquo;t just going to be upwards. Bitcoin may well sweep lower and test the support at $24,260 where it can also find trend line support plus the middle of the Gaussian Channel on the weekly time frame.</p>
<p>Should all the above be wrong then a far more extensive bear market would come into play. Whatever happens, bitcoin is hard money you can own, spend and save without any government or bank say-so. That is certainly worth much consideration.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto community has rallied behind respected blockchain sleuth ZachXBT just days after disclosing a lawsuit related to a previous investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donations to ZachXBT have poured in from across the crypto community and have crossed over $1 million so far to help fund his legal defense.&nbsp;</p>
Donations Pour In&nbsp;
<p>Following the disclosure of the lawsuit, the blockchain sleuth posted a digital wallet address on his official Twitter handle, along with details of the lawsuit filed against him by Jeffrey Huang. Huang is a Taiwanese-American musician and tech entrepreneur. ZachXBT described the lawsuit as troubling and called it a &ldquo;David and Goliath&rdquo; story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate I have to make this thread, but I am being sued by MachiBigBrother for an article I published in June 2022. Today Machi filed a defamation lawsuit. The lawsuit is baseless and an attempt to chill free speech. I intend to fight back &amp; defend free speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ZachXBT noted that his legal expenses could cost more than $1 million. However, in an example of how tight-knit the crypto community is, donations poured in, and within a day, ZachXBT&rsquo;s donation wallet accumulated digital assets worth beyond the stated goal. According to Nansen Portfolio, a majority of donations primarily consisted of stablecoins. ZachXBT added that any leftover funds would be returned back to the donors on a pro-rata basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am creating a donation address to assist with legal costs associated with the defense of this matter, which could easily exceed $1m USD. All leftover funds will be returned on a pro-rata basis to contributors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Currently, the wallet contains over $650,000 worth of USDC, $274,000 worth of Tether, and several other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC).&nbsp;</p>
Prominent Names Step In To Help
<p>Several users from a number of cryptocurrency exchanges also donated towards the effort, with ZachXBT&rsquo;s donation wallet receiving funds from wallets linked to all major exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, OKX, Coinbase, Bitfinex, Bybit, 1inch, and Uniswap. Donations under the $100 mark number in the thousands, while several donations are between $10,000 and $50,000, as several prominent members from the crypto ecosystem also chipped in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also made a donation of $50,000, urging ZachXBT to keep up the fight and help keep crypto transparent. The donation from Zhao comes even as the Binance CEO is himself grappling with a lawsuit filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun also donated $10,000 worth of the True USD stablecoin. Sun also highlighted ZachXBT&rsquo;s role in educating the crypto community, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to pledge a donation of 10k #TUSD to @zachxbt. Despite not being a legal expert myself, I highly value Zach&rsquo;s substantial contributions to blockchain security and his crucial role in guiding our users to safeguard their funds.&rdquo;</p>

The Lawsuit Against ZachXBT&nbsp;
<p>ZachXBT was sued by NFT trader MachiBigBrother, also called Jeffrey Huang. ZachXBT had published a report about Huang last year, alleging that he had embezzled millions of dollars worth of crypto. MachiBigBrother filed the lawsuit against the blockchain sleuth in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging that ZachXBT&rsquo;s report caused serious monetary and reputational harm. The lawyer representing MachiBigBrother stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without any regard for the ruinous effect that public allegations of criminal conduct can produce for the accused individual, [ZachXBT] not only proceeded to publish his defamatory article on Medium.com, he also maliciously promoted the article to his more than 300,000 Twitter followers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ZachXBT faces one count of libel and one count of libel per se. The lawsuit also requests that the court order ZachXBT to pay actual and compensatory damages in addition to exemplary damages, the amount of which will be determined by the court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZachXBT has emerged as one of the most prominent voices in the crypto space and has shone a light on several crypto projects and on-chain events. In the process, he has uncovered several potential scams and bad actors and studied exploits and hacks to find out their root causes. His detective work has also led to several real-world arrests and helped him amass a significant following, along with a place on the Consensus Magazine&rsquo;s Most Influential 2022 list.</p>
<p>However, the lawsuit has threatened to compromise ZachXBT&rsquo;s identity after his name and place of residence were revealed. However, as the lawsuit progresses, the crypto and Web3 communities have come out in complete support through their donations.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>VanEck has made a bold prediction, suggesting that Ethereum will reach $50,000 by 2030. The investment management firm's claim is based on Ethereum's presence in crucial industry sectors and its potential to revolutionize finance, banking, payments, social interactions, gaming, and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum's token supply reduction, where transaction fees result in Ethereum burning, contributes to its value. The question is not if, but when, will Ethereum reach support levels and all-time highs due to its enduring demand? Looking at the chart, it is evident that bulls have maintained their position above the falling wedge pattern's resistance line, indicating demand at lower levels.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Glassnode's Ethereum and Bitcoin Analysis
<p>Glassnode has focused its attention on Bitcoin and has identified an upcoming transition point in the market cycle. This transition, coupled with macroeconomics and price action for Bitcoin and Ethereum, is expected to lead to increased price volatility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the ongoing SEC situation, the macro environment will become more unpredictable from next week onwards. Despite this uncertainty, the price of Bitcoin has managed to stay above the crucial support at $25,000, suggesting that recent SEC events are already factored into the price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traders are keen to buy the dip, with notable figures like ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood investing millions of dollars in Coinbase stock and Block Inc. shares.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve: A Comprehensive Web3 Trading Solution
<p>Tradecurve.io provides customers with a hybrid platform for trading cryptocurrencies and derivatives from a single account, eliminating the need to disclose personal information.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 26587 Objective:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 19 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) moderated early in the Asian session as the pair continues to orbit the 26587.57 area, an upside price objective above which Stops were recently executed and that is associated with buying pressure that emerged around the 24750 and 25143.24 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders recently pushed BTC/USD up to the 26783.20 area after Stops were elected above the 26611.97 area, representing the 50% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 28473.93 to 24750.&nbsp; Additional upside retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 27051, 27595, and 27677 areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical significance of these levels was confirmed when buying pressure emerged around the 26165 area during a pullback, just above another upside price objective around the 26153 area.&nbsp; Below the market, downside price objectives include the 25323.24 and 24680.87 levels.&nbsp; Stops are also cited below major retracement levels linked to the 19568.52 and 15460 levels, including the 25094, 23954, 23255, 22278, and 22025 areas.</p>
<p>Additional downside price objectives include the 24440, 23208, and 22769 levels.&nbsp; Following recent price activity, areas of technical resistance and potential selling pressure include the 27528, 27737, 27805, 28200, 28473, and 28873 levels.&nbsp; Upside retracement levels in recent depreciating ranges include the 28700, 28741, 28868, 29243, 29299, and 29284 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30420.74, 31237.11, 31477.37, 32501.23, 32556.73, 32989.19, 34583.96, 34658.69, 35222.66, 37765.28, and 38403.97 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 26326.83 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 26169.53.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly abov SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
