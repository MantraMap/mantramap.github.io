The broader cryptocurrency market has seen improvement in investor sentiment in the last weeks, and so has XRP. Even the global crypto market cap is up by 0.11%, reflecting the rate at which most tokens are rallying over the past few days. A recent WhaleAlert report reveals massive XRP whale transfers happening amid the token&#8217;s price surge. The report showed the movement of nearly 429 million tokens (about $167 million) on multiple whale addresses in the last 24 hours.

The crypto whales added $49 million (about 123 million XRP) in multiple transactions. One whale address accumulated 94.3 million tokens ($38 million) in a transaction from Binance. XRP Makes Top 1,000 BSC Whales List Following Price Surge Ripple&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, XRP, has recorded a price increase of nearly 12% in the past seven days. Its trading volume has also added by 55% and is now at $1.3 billion. Despite the long-running lawsuit from the SEC against Ripple, XRP&#8217;s market cap remained unfazed, being over $19.5 billion. However, WhaleAlert recorded outflows of Ripple&#8217;s native coin on several whale addresses. Several whales moved 97 million of Ripple&#8217;s native coin worth approximately $37 million to the Bitstamp crypto exchange. Aside from the massive whale addresses activity, WhaleStats also reported that XRP tokens ranked the second largest cryptocurrency by dollar value held by the top 1,000 BSC (Binance Smart Chain) whales. The biggest BSC whale now holds about $27.6 million worth of the cryptocurrency. According to recent data, XRP secured its place on the top 10 purchased cryptocurrencies by the largest BSC whales. It also made the list of the most traded token by BSC whales. ChatGPT Gives Surprising XRP Price Prediction For March 2023 Meanwhile, Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, recently shared a ChatGPT conversation on Ripple&#8217;s native coin via a tweet. ChatGPT is an AI model chatbot developed by OpenAI. It launched on November 2022. Martin Hiesboeck shared a snapshot of his conversation with the ChatGPT, where he asked the robot about XRP&#8217;s moon date. After refusing to answer initially, ChatGPT told the Uphold executive that Ripple&#8217;s native coin would moon on March 23, 2023. It also added what looked like a price prediction saying, &#8220;XRP to $589,000, up yours XRPP.&#8221; This response cracked members of Ripple&#8217;s native coin community up with laughter. Some community members responded with laughter emojis, while few saw it as a forecast that the XRP price might moon. Hiesboeck even wrote that the all-knowing AI ChatGPT has revealed when the token will moon after much persuasion. John Deaton, blockchain enthusiast and founder of CryptoLaw, also reacted to Hiesboeck’s post, citing what people said about the $589,000 price for Ripple&#8217;s native coin. Many predictions have suggested that the crypto may hit the $100 but deemed the $589,000 price unrealistic.

However, most analysts might be waiting for the verdict of the Ripple/SEC lawsuit before making predictions. According to data from CoinGecko, Ripple&#8217;s native coin has gained 11.4% in the past seven days and 13.5% in the past 14 days. However, the token trades at $0.3876.
