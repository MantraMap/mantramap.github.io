<p>For cryptocurrency traders, having constant access to account balances, open positions, and global market prices is absolutely essential. But being chained to a trading desk or computer simply isn't always desirable in today's fast-paced, mobile world. Thankfully, the award-winning PrimeXBT mobile app provides traders with everything they could possibly need to stay tightly connected to crypto markets, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>Whether lounging by the seaside on a tropical beach vacation, traversing new exotic lands as a digital nomad, or simply walking your dog around the neighborhood, you can react in real-time to sudden volatility spikes and efficiently manage existing trades in just a few taps. The PrimeXBT app puts a full suite of professional trading tools right to the palm of your hand.</p>
<p></p>
Stay informed with real-time market data and pricing
<p>The intuitive PrimeXBT interface grants easy access to over 100 diverse trading instruments across forex, commodities, stock indices, and of course, cryptocurrencies. The mobile app's customisable watchlist feature lets you easily track real-time pricing data across all major global markets.</p>
<p>Scroll through and view up-to-the-second price action on popular forex pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/JPY. Check current gold and crude oil prices, alongside stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, and Nikkei 225. The app also provides live updated prices for all top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and many more.</p>
<p>With constant access to global market prices right at your fingertips, you can capitalise on emerging short-term opportunities or adjust current open positions to mitigate your risk. The app ensures you have the latest market data, no matter where you are located in the world, at any given moment.</p>
<p></p>
Execute trades and complex strategies in a few taps
<p>Acting decisively on a compelling potential trade is just as quick and seamless in the PrimeXBT mobile app. You can easily long or short Bitcoin and other popular digital assets with just a few taps. And use advanced mobile charting capabilities and technical indicators to help identify and confirm ideal entry and exit points.</p>
<p>The app's robust trading features allow executing complex strategies like building long/short portfolios across diverse asset classes, to properly diversify and reduce risk. Or utilise leverage up to 200x on crypto trades, for significantly greater profit potential.</p>
<p>Managing open positions across markets is equally simple and intuitive. The app clearly displays all current positions, their unrealised profit/loss in real-time, and allows you to quickly modify stop losses and take profit levels. You thus have full mobile control and can close positions to take profits or add margin to current trades when necessary.</p>
<p></p>
Access unique features like Covesting Copy Trading
<p>In addition to core trading capabilities, the PrimeXBT app also conveniently grants you access to unique proprietary features unavailable anywhere else. This includes the Covesting Copy Trading module, which lets you automatically mimic the trades of vetted professionals.</p>
<p>You can browse detailed strategy manager profiles, showcasing transparent historical performance data. And pick a consistently profitable trader to copy based on metrics like all-time ROI percentage, win rate percentage, and five star rating. Any and all trades the manager executes will replicate in your account, allowing you to piggyback off their proven expertise.</p>
<p>Copying the best crypto traders on the platform is an excellent way to diversify and grow your income streams. The mobile app makes it easy to find top trading talent and capitalise on their signals from anywhere around the globe.</p>
<p></p>
Deposit, withdraw, and manage your account on the go
<p>The ability to securely deposit funds, withdraw profits, or access 24/7 multilingual customer support via live chat is an additional convenience. The app even recently added the ability to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Coin, and Tether stablecoins directly on your mobile device, making topping up your trading account easier than ever.</p>
<p>Managing your fiat (USD and EUR), cryptocurrency, and stablecoin balances, and initiating transactions is simple and intuitive through the well-designed wallet interface. And should any issues arise, PrimeXBT&rsquo;s responsive global customer support team is available through the app day and night.</p>
Built for today's active, on-the-go crypto traders
