<p>Domain names are undoubtedly hot assets in today&rsquo;s tech-driven world. According to VeriSign&rsquo;s Domain Name Industry Brief, the third quarter of 2022 witnessed over 349 million domain registrations. Additionally, a report published by Godaddy, an internet domain registrar and web hosting company, revealed that the average price of a domain name sold in the secondary market (from someone who already owns it) climbed up to thousands of dollars. In 2019, MicroStrategy bought Voice.com from the owner for a mouth-watering amount of $30 million. This year (2022), Connect.com was sold for a whopping $10 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously Web3 domains are just a big new market at its very early rise. How to benefit from it? The advent of Web3 has also introduced a new twitch to the domain market, with Web3 domains like ENS already selling high in the market. For example, on September 22, 2022, a buyer bought &ldquo;pjfi.eth&rdquo; for 0.12 ETH or $161 and later sold it for 350 ETH or $463 200. Also, 000.eth bought for 2.6 ETH or $638 on June 10, 2020, was sold for 300 ETH or $317,000 on July 3, 2022. Not to mention that this is not a purchase to own. ENS sales domains based on the renting model like Web 2.0 does.</p>
<p>W3DNA is a revolutionary Web3 domain name service that significantly improved on what the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is currently offering. While the ENS is built on only the Ethereum blockchain, W3DNA supports Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and Polygon. You have already seen the profit margins of those that have purchased with the ENS. Now let us imagine what the future holds for an arguably more robust web3 domain registrar like W3DNA. It undoubtedly presents a good investment opportunity for those who understand that the future lies with Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Details about W3DNA Domains</p>
<p>W3DNA is an NFT domain, name, and account deployed on Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum blockchain protocols. After your registration with W3DNA, you will be automatically given a username in addition to an account. With such an account, users can receive payment in any cryptocurrency. You can opt to register your W3DNA domain in any language and choose any symbol you want including emoji. The W3DNA domain does not have any extension, and there are also no length limits from just one letter, sign, number, picture to infinity.</p>
<p>How W3DNA Works</p>
<p>The W3DNA offers users an NFT domain, a name, and an account, thus breaking new ground in Web3. The name provided by W3DNA gives users exclusive ownership. It allows name owners to store their avatars and other profile information they can use in W3DNA services, including social networks, decentralized messengers, etc. Additionally, the account will enable users to store all their crypto addresses, ensuring they can accept payment in any cryptocurrency of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>W3DNA is designed to free users from an obligatory assignment of any top level domain in the form name.com, .edu, .net, etc.. This approach ensures that two users do not have twin domain names, for example, "sales.com" and "sales.net." The platform does not restrict users to particular symbols or languages. User can choose domain name in the same language that is native to the audience. By allowing users to Synchronized mint on three chains with an unlimited number of EVM chains to be integrated in the nearest future protect users from mistakes when receiving or transferring crypto assets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Advantages and Disadvantages of W3DNA&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>W3DNA does not have extensions (that is .com, .etc, .bsc, .net, .edu, .art), thus granting exclusive ownership until you opt to sell it.</li>
<li>The absence of extensions increases the investment value, blocking any other&nbsp; user from purchasing the same domain with a mix of letters from different alphabets or different extensions. The same goes for punctuation marks.</li>
<li>You can earn huge returns by reselling the domains on marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Users can mint their NFT domain only once on three different chains (BSC, Polygon, and Ethereum) simultaneously.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You only pay for the domain once and own it forever - there are no renewal fees in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Since W3DNA does not allow extensions, two users cannot share a name. For example, you cannot have names like Chain.com and Chain.io for two different owners. However, being an owner of Chain you can keep different websites of three different chains.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The price of domains increases based on the number sold. Starting at a basic $15 at the launch period the price will increase to a minimum of $30 within less than a year. Therefore, the longer you procrastinate buying a domain, the more likely you are to pay a higher price.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>How You can Buy and Sell Domains</p>
<p>Buying and selling domains is pretty straightforward, provided you have a good understanding of the processes involved. First, you must already know the W3DNA domain name(s) you want to buy or sell. Here is a step-by-step guide on buying and selling your domain on W3DNA.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to the W3DNA site and type in the domain in the language of your choice which you aim to buy and check if it is available.</li>
<li>Once you verify that this&nbsp; domain is available, the price for the domain is displayed.</li>
<li>Finally choose a payment method from crypto, credit card, or payment service to pay for the domain. You can pay with USDT (Bep-20), BTC, ETH, or other accepted cryptocurrencies. You can also pay using your bank card.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Earning Great Returns from W3DNA</p>
<p>As the introduction explains, you can make huge amounts of money buying and selling Web3 domains, just like the ENS where people spend as little as $150 on domains and then resell them for over $300k. Just think of the fact that in the case of ENS people are not reselling the domain per say they are reselling the right to rent it from ENS. From the W3DNA&nbsp; you can purchase unique and sort-after domains for as low as $15 and resell for as high as 10,000X in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine buying a Ronaldo or Messi domain for less than $50 and having to resell it for much higher amounts than the initial price paid. This is the opportunity that W3DNA has presented to you today. See detailed information here to learn how to buy and sell W3DNA domains.</p>
