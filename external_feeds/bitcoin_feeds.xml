Notably, within the last week alone, it saw a decrease of more than 11%. Interestingly, within the past 24 hours, WLD showcased a rise of more than 15% against the greenback. Furthermore, four days prior, the count of distinct wallets containing WLD surpassed the 500,000 mark.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Plummets Over 50% Since Its All-Time High</h2>
<p>According to statistics, the iris-scanning crypto project <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-opens-probe-into-worldcoin-personal-data-treatment-procedures/">Worldcoin</a>&#x2018;s native token, WLD, has increased 15% in the last 24 hours. Data from July 24 to <a href="https://archive.ph/g6SUj">August 18, 2023</a>, shows WLD has declined 29.1% against the U.S. dollar. Currently, WLD ranks 156 out of more than 10,000 crypto assets listed, with a market value of about $194 million. There&#x2019;s a circulating supply of <a href="https://archive.ph/K46Da#selection-699.0-699.11">178.9 million WLD</a>, trading at $1.53 each. WLD is down 53.46% from its all-time high on July 24, 2023, its listing date.</p>

<p>Of the 178.9 million WLD in existence, <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2766822/4605343">17.45 million</a> are claimed tokens, according to data from Dune Analytics. On August 14, 2023, the number of wallets holding WLD surpassed 500,000, and as of August 18, there are 531,236 unique addresses. The top wallet, which is the contract, holds 97.52 million WLD, or 54.52% of the supply. The second wallet, also under Worldcoin control, holds 30.98 million WLD, or 17.33% of the current supply. The third-largest WLD holder is <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xF977814e90dA44bFA03b6295A0616a897441aceC">Binance&#x2019;s cold wallet</a> with about 11.7 million tokens or 6.54%.</p>

<p>&#x200B;&#x200B;The market maker Wintermute holds the <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0x55697d6ef379C6324e41f350A3db4ee19BAb82A0">fourth-largest WLD wallet</a> with 7.19 million, or 4.03% of the supply. Worldcoin operates the fifth-largest WLD address with about 3.45 million tokens (1.93%), while the sixth-largest Worldcoin wallet belongs to the crypto exchange Okx. As of August 18, the <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xEbe80f029b1c02862B9E8a70a7e5317C06F62Cae">Okx wallet</a> holds approximately 2.13 million WLD, or 1.19% of the total supply. The six aforementioned WLD wallets control 85.53% of the 178.9 million WLD. The top 100 Worldcoin (WLD) holders collectively own 94.04% of the supply.</p>

<p>In the past 24 hours, WLD has seen about $89.76 million in trade volume. The crypto asset&#x2019;s $194 million represents 0.018% of the $1.09 trillion crypto economy. The four most traded pairs for WLD are tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), USD Coin (USDC) and the Korean won, followed by the U.S. dollar. Tether trades make up 96% of WLD&#x2019;s 24-hour trade volume. About $1.01 million of the $89.76 million comes from Uniswap v3 on Ethereum, and roughly $190,000 was recorded in the last day on the Optimism version of Uniswap v3, with the most traded pair being WETH.</p>

Prices recently fell lower for six straight days, however, bulls have reentered the market snapping this streak in the process. Dogecoin also rebounded today. </strong></p>
<h2>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>)</h2>
<p>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>) rose higher on Saturday, following a recent six-day losing streak which pushed the price to a multi-month low.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>/USD climbed to an intraday peak at $0.12 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following a low of $0.1115 the day prior.</p>
<p>The move comes as stellar continued to move away from a support point at $0.110, which was hit on Thursday.</p>

<p>This was the first time the price collided with this floor since mid-June, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) hit its own floor at 30.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index has also rebounded and is now tracking at 34.84, which is marginally below a ceiling at 36.00.</p>
<p>Should it push past this point, the next likely price target will be around a ceiling of $0.1340.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>, dogecoin (DOGE) was also in the green to start the weekend, as it bounced from a floor of its own.</p>
<p>After trading at a low of $0.06079 during Friday&#x2019;s session, DOGE/USD surged to a peak of $0.06385 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The jump in price came as the meme coin moved away from a support point of $0.0600, which is near a recent two-month low.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>, the RSI on the dogecoin chart has bounced from a support point at the 30.00 mark, and is now tracking at 34.13.</p>
<p>The next visible point of resistance is at the 44.00 mark, and should this point be hit, DOGE will likely be near $0.06600.</p>

Market sentiment was bearish following reports that Spacex liquidated its bitcoin holdings. Ethereum remains below $1,700.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bears continued to circle bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) to start the weekend, as the cryptocurrency had its biggest one-day decline since the collapse of FTX.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to a low of $25,668.92 on Saturday, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $26,598.65.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, bitcoin remains close to a two-month low, with some traders targeting a breakout below $25,000.</p>

<p>Overall, the relative strength index (RSI) is deep in bearish territory, with a current reading of 18.56.</p>
<p>Price strength hasn&#x2019;t tracked below 20.00 since January last year, which for some was the beginning of the so-called &#x201C;crypto winter&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Should there be further declines this weekend, the target will likely be a support point of $24,900.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was marginally higher on Saturday, as the price rebounded from a recent move below $1,600.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,695.45 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to a bottom of $1,644.93 to start the weekend.</p>
<p>On Thursday, ethereum dropped to a low of $1,540, which was its weakest point since March 12, when the price was trading below the $1,459 level.</p>

<p>The 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly on a downward trend, after appearing as though it was nearing an upwards cross earlier in the week.</p>
<p>As of writing, ethereum seems to have found a firm floor around the $1,660 level.</p>

Blockchain.com, Human Capital, Vy Capital, Sky9 Capital, and Jane Street Capital, among others, participated in the funding round. Zetachain will use the funds to launch its solution on mainnet and grow its app ecosystem.</strong></p>
<h2>Zetachain Raises $27 Million in Series A Funding Round</h2>
<p>Zetachain, an interoperability-focused blockchain project, has <a href="https://blog.zetachain.com/zetachain-raises-27m-for-interoperable-layer-1-blockchain-that-connects-all-chains-including-7584dc0c673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $27 million in a Series A funding round. Blockchain.com, Human Capital, Vy Capital, Sky9 Capital, Jane Street Capital, VistaLabs, CMT Digital, Foundation Capital, Lingfeng Capital, GSR, and others participated in the round. Funds will be used to launch the mainnet of the chain and also to grow its decentralized app ecosystem.</p>
<p>Zetachain wants to tackle the isolation problem that affects blockchains, where resources are siloed and cannot be used in separate chains or applications. Zetachain states its mission is to &#8220;establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability where users can access all of their assets and data from one wallet on a single platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This includes non-smart-contracts-enabled blockchains, like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Zetachain&#8217;s architecture allows the users to leverage these assets without using structures to bridges or wrapped tokens and the security liabilities they present.</p>

<h2>A Growing Testnet Ecosystem</h2>
<p>While Zetachain&#8217;s solutions are still in testnet stages, there are already more than 27,000 decentralized application contracts used in several applications in various fields, including decentralized finance (defi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), universal Web3 social, identity, and gaming protocols.</p>
<p>Zetachain claims that 1.7 million users have participated on its testnet, with over 13 million transactions completed. With its design approach, the company expects that fees, slippage, and complexity will be reduced for the average user to reach global audiences and introduce them to crypto. For them, solving the fragmentation problem is &#8220;critical to enabling Web3 apps and services to reach a larger audience in the hundreds of millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next step for Zetachain is to launch its product on mainnet, which still does not have a definitive launch date. However, the interoperability issue is complex, and several competitors are trying to offer their own particular solutions to this problem. In March, Layerzero Labs <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/layerzero-labs-secures-135-million-to-bolster-cross-chain-interoperability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $135 million in a Series A+ funding round for developing cross-chain decentralized applications.</p>

Crypto asset businesses will be required to take &#8220;all reasonable steps&#8221; to ensure compliance with the travel rule. When the rule becomes effective, compliance with the rule is still expected even when a crypto asset business uses a third-party supplier.</strong></p>
<h2>Delays in Implementing Travel Rule</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom’s financial services industry regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said crypto firms based in the country will soon be required to adhere to the so-called travel rule. According to the regulator, crypto firms are expected to start complying with this rule from Sept 1, 2023.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">statement released</a> on Aug. 17, the FCA suggested that its decision to enforce the requirement aligns with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s call for the swift implementation of the travel rule. Despite the FATF’s call, many countries have failed to implement the travel rule due to delays &#8220;in adoption and different timelines for enforcement of the Travel Rule across jurisdictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Explaining why the UK is proceeding to implement the rule compelling crypto firms to collect, verify, and share information, the FCA said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have worked closely with industry to provide guidance on how to comply and what we reasonably expect of firms ahead of other countries following the UK’s position.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of this step taken by the U.K., crypto asset businesses based in the country will be required to take &#8220;all reasonable steps&#8221; to comply with the rule. Compliance with the rule is still expected even when a crypto asset business uses a third-party supplier.</p>
<h2>Crypto Firms Expected to Collect and Verify Information</h2>
<p>In instances where funds are being sent to a jurisdiction without the travel rule, the FCA said crypto firms must still collect and verify the information before a transfer is made. If the funds are being transferred from a jurisdiction without the travel rule, the necessary risk-based assessments must be undertaken before deciding to avail these to the beneficiary or not, the regulator said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FCA said it has been working on a guidance to help firms comply with the travel rule. The financial services industry watchdog added that crypto asset businesses can also share their thoughts about the guidance on or before Aug. 25, 2023.</p>

One such strategy, dubbed &#x201C;Method B,&#x201D; asserts it elevates the likelihood by a remarkable 260% compared to traditional mining searches, simultaneously slashing energy use by 4.3%.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>QBT&#x2019;s Innovation Claims to Find Hashes Faster</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The crypto sphere is <a href="https://twitter.com/SimplyBitcoinTV/status/1692137247129141402?s=20">abuzz</a> over a freshly uncovered research firm, <a href="https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/">Quantum Blockchain Technologies</a> (QBT). For over two years, they&#x2019;ve been diving deep into <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining and the intricacies of the SHA256 algorithm. QBT boasts a breakthrough: using machine learning to predict blockchain movements, allowing for advanced block computations. Their claimed cutting-edge <a href="https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/rd">research</a> taps into quantum computing, cryptographic enhancements, deep learning, AI, and the design of FPGA and ASIC, among other innovative methods.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantum-blockchain-technologies-hard-filing-114238925.html">recent conversation</a> with Thomas Warner, QBT&#x2019;s chief Francesco Gardin shed light on this groundbreaking tech shortly after the <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/QBT/patent-application/16052227">U.K. patent filing</a>. Gardin is confident that their insights surpass the prevailing wisdom in today&#x2019;s mining sector, thanks to collaborations with North American experts. Their patent unveils a novel strategy named &#x201C;MSFCA&#x201D; or &#x201C;ASIC Enhanced Boost,&#x201D; enabling miners to commence work on upcoming blocks even before wrapping up the current one. QBT insists this forward-thinking approach conserves both time and computing power, particularly for application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
QBT believes this innovation tackles a significant hiccup in <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> mining: the waiting period between blocks. While MSFCA doesn&#x2019;t turbocharge the primary SHA256 computations, it greenlights some preemptive work, optimizing energy and resources. The trick? Minimizing the use of specific components (logic gates) on the ASIC chip. Gardin shared with Warner that QBT&#x2019;s innovation might slash logical gates, potentially whittling circuits down by 8%. Researchers say while some extra gear is required for this anticipatory work, its footprint remains negligible.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite facing a few tech hurdles, such as memory chip constraints, QBT is bullish on MSFCA&#x2019;s prospects. Their &#x201C;<a href="https://quantumblockchaintechnologies.co.uk/products-services">Method B</a>&#x201D; rapidly runs myriad terahashes within the typical ten-minute block window, expertly steering the hunt to zones where winning hashes might lurk. By blending machine learning with mathematical techniques, this approach cherry-picks hashes from the most promising sectors, eliminating redundant calculations.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Lab tests by QBT indicate that Method B spots winning hashes a staggering 260% faster than conventional methods, cutting energy use by roughly 4.3%. This tech revelation coincides with Bitcoin&#x2019;s hashrate soaring to record-breaking levels, nearing an impressive half zettahash. As of today, Friday, August 18, 2023, the <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">total network hashrate</a> stands at 358.58 exahash per second (EH/s). Mining manufacturing bigwigs like Bitmain, Microbt, and Canaan are in a race, crafting rigs equipped with ultra-efficient chips.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Microbt&#x2019;s newest unit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">churns out</a> 320 terahash per second (TH/s), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/samsungs-3nm-gaa-chip-discovered-in-microbts-next-gen-bitcoin-mining-rig/">rumored</a> to harness Samsung&#x2019;s 3-nm GAA semiconductor. Bitmain just <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmain-to-reveal-groundbreaking-antminer-s21-at-2023-world-digital-mining-summit/">unveiled</a> a rig set to revolutionize energy efficiency, dipping below the 20 joules per terahash (J/T) mark. Meanwhile, Canaan is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/canaan-to-debut-groundbreaking-bitcoin-mining-product-at-10th-anniversary-singapore-event/">teasing</a> a game-changing product set to debut in September, aligning with Bitmain&#x2019;s latest launch.&#13;<br />

The unit said players can reduce the chances of losing money to scammers by doing their own research before committing funds. </strong></p>
<h2>Role Played by Custom-Made Gaming Apps</h2>
<p>The Philippines’ cybercrime fighting unit, the National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP ACG), has told residents to be wary of rewards offered by play-to-earn (P2E) games as such games are increasingly being used to steal crypto assets worth millions of dollars. In a warning published in the unit’s latest <a href="https://acg.pnp.gov.ph/main/images/CSB/CSB_292.pdf">cyber security bulletin</a>, the cybercrime unit said the theft of unsuspecting victims’ crypto assets is perpetrated via custom-created gaming apps.</p>
<p>According to the unit, these gaming apps lure victims with promises of &#8220;huge financial rewards directly proportional to investments to potential targets.&#8221; Such promises are usually made after criminals have succeeded in cultivating relationships with victims over time. The group added:</p>
<blockquote><p>They then introduce victims to an online or mobile game, in which players purportedly earn cryptocurrency rewards in exchange for some activity, such as growing &#8216;crops&#8217; on an animated farm. The mobile games have been designed to display fake rewards that accumulate as the victim plays.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once a victim stops depositing crypto assets into an already compromised wallet, the cybercriminals then siphon the funds. The cybercrime unit added that hackers usually get away with such crimes because &#8220;cryptocurrency is relatively new and not well-regulated.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Advantages of Crypto Gaming Over Traditional Games</h2>
<p>The police bulletin nevertheless acknowledges the advantages of crypto gaming over traditional games, citing the popular P2E gaming platform Axie Infinity which is said to offer players a variety of ways to earn money.</p>
<p>However, the level of investment which is sometimes needed to play can put off some players. On the other hand, players can also lose their digital assets when they sent them to a &#8220;wallet that does not support the asset.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bulletin further says players can reduce the chances of losing money to scammers by doing their own research before committing funds. They should also be on the lookout for fake individuals and deceptive links.</p>

<h2>Spacex Writes Down $373M in Bitcoin Value</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk&#x2019;s Spacex has written down its bitcoin investments, citing documents it has seen. The news outlet wrote:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Spacex wrote down the value of bitcoin it owns by a total of $373 million last year and in 2021 and has sold the cryptocurrency. Tesla has taken a similar approach with its bitcoin holdings. Musk has posted about cryptocurrencies frequently over the years.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
This led to numerous headlines claiming that Spacex had liquidated its entire bitcoin holdings, sending the price of bitcoin tumbling.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, many people took to social media to point out that writing down investments is a standard accounting practice for businesses and does not imply that the investments have been sold or liquidated. For example, a company might write down the value of its inventory if its market value has declined, yet retain the inventory until it is no longer needed.&#13;</p>
<h2>Tesla and Spacex Adopt Similar Bitcoin Approach</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Although Elon Musk <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-spacex-owns-bitcoin-personally-owns-btc-ethereum-dogecoin-pump-dont-dump/">revealed</a> in July 2021 that Spacex owned bitcoin, the details of the company&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holdings remain largely undisclosed. In contrast, there is greater transparency regarding Tesla&#x2019;s bitcoin position. According to the Wall Street Journal, both companies have adopted a similar approach to their bitcoin holdings.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
During the first quarter of 2021, Tesla purchased bitcoin valued at $1.5 billion. The company subsequently trimmed its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> stash twice: once also in Q1 2021 and the other instance in July last year &#x2014; the same years Spacex reportedly wrote down its bitcoin holdings.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In Q1 2021, Tesla <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-owns-bitcoin-has-not-sold-any-tesla-hold-btc-long-term-sold-to-prove-liquidity/">sold</a> $272 million in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Musk clarified that the sale was &#x201C;to prove liquidity of bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.&#x201D; In July last year, the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-sold-75-of-its-bitcoin-elon-musk-says-we-have-not-sold-any-of-our-dogecoin/">sold</a> approximately 75% of its bitcoin, which added $936 million in cash to its balance sheet. Musk explained that the company needed to &#x201C;maximize&#x201D; its cash position due to &#x201C;the uncertainty of the Covid lockdowns in China.&#x201D; The billionaire stressed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>We are certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in the future, so this should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Despite the two <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> sales, Tesla still owns bitcoin valued at <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/teslas-bitcoin-portfolio-remains-unchanged-at-184m-for-third-straight-quarter-q2-2023-report/">$184 million</a>, as disclosed in the company&#x2019;s Q2 financials.&#13;<br />

The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and its campus will subsidize 90% of the costs of these licenses to attract companies in this sector as part of its push to become a worldwide tech hub.</strong></p>
<h2>Dubai to Offer Subsidies for Web3 and AI Companies</h2>
<p>The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) announced the issuance of special commercial licenses for Web3 and artificial intelligence (AI) companies wanting to set up operations in the emirate. 90% of the cost of each license will be subsidized to help companies in their initial stages.</p>
<p>The licenses offered will allow the companies to access physical offices and co-working spaces in the Innovation One building, according to a press release issued by the DIFC.</p>
<p>The UAE Ministry of Economy details that the DIFC <a href="https://www.moec.gov.ae/en/-/dubai-international-financial-centre?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Ffree-zones%3Fstart%3D2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has</a> more than 25,000 professionals working at more than 2,000 active registered companies, as one of the biggest financial centers for the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. With this move, the DIFC hopes to become a significant hub in the industry, advancing and supporting Dubai&#8217;s leadership in Web3 and AI technology.</p>

<h2>Becoming a Tech Hub</h2>
<p>Only companies looking to develop activities in areas such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) services, specialized AI research &amp; consultancies, IT infrastructure building, technology research and development, and public networking services will be able to take advantage of these license subsidies.</p>
<p>Mohammad Alblooshi, CEO of the DIFC Innovation Hub, detailed that he was optimistic about attracting innovation to the center with this move. He <a href="https://www.difc.ae/newsroom/news/dubai-ai-and-web-30-campus-introduces-specialised-licensing-solutions-tech-firms-looking-scale-their-business-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are confident that by granting these licenses, we will attract more global talent and investment to the region and create a culture of collaboration and innovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Alblooshi qualified this move as a milestone for the center to &#8220;strengthen Dubai&#8217;s position as the business destination of choice for technology-focused companies and attract more world-class talent and diversified investors to the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dubai has shown its interest in Web3 and other new technologies previously. In March, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), another free zone in the emirate, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubai-free-trade-zone-partners-with-south-korean-companies-to-expand-web3-and-metaverse-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a series of agreements with Korean Web3 and metaverse companies to bring their activities to the country and expand Dubai&#8217;s business in the Web3 industry.</p>

A Dappradar study reveals that trading actions and sales figures for Bitcoin Ordinals have plummeted by a staggering 97% since their May 2023 zenith. This downturn mirrors a wider slowdown in the NFT sector. However, the slump in Bitcoin Ordinals is far more pronounced than in established networks such as Ethereum.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin NFTs Face Crossroads: Ordinal Sales Decline Highlights Market Volatility and the Quest for Tangible Utility</h2>
<p>After soaring to record levels this spring, the nascent market for Bitcoin-centric NFTs has hit a snag. By June and July, Bitcoin Ordinals reported a sharp drop in both sales and transactions, diving 97% and 98% from their May pinnacle. Dappradar&#8217;s <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/ordinals-sales-down-97-since-may-are-bitcoin-nfts-over">analysis</a> indicates that Ordinals trading dwindled from $452 million in May to a mere $3 million in early August.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also been a sharp downturn in active participants in the Bitcoin NFT arena. The number of unique active Bitcoin wallet addresses plunged 90% from February to mid-August, dwindling from 79,261 to a scant 6,708. While Ethereum and Polygon have witnessed declines in active traders, their 22% and 60% reductions during the same timeframe seem trivial compared to Bitcoin&#8217;s dramatic downturn.</p>
<p>Dappradar posits that this retraction may signal waning excitement and trust in Bitcoin NFTs&#8217; prospects. Unlike their counterparts in Ethereum and Polygon, Bitcoin&#8217;s NFT sphere is predominantly dominated by profile picture collections, which generally offer limited utility. Given the broader and more varied offerings of Ethereum and Polygon, Bitcoin&#8217;s narrow NFT specialization might be accelerating its descent.</p>
<p>“As you can see using <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/nft/collections/chain/bitcoin?range=all">Dappradar’s NFT Collection Ranking</a>, most of the collections on Bitcoin are still in the early stages and still lack the innovation that the NFT space is experiencing – regarding interoperability, dynamism, and utility,&#8221; the report states.</p>
<p>Dappradar’s report says the coming months are set to be defining moments for Bitcoin NFTs. It further notes how there&#8217;s a debate within the community: some advocate for Bitcoin to maintain its &#8220;digital gold&#8221; persona, suggesting Ethereum plays the &#8220;digital oil&#8221; role, powering Web3 innovations.</p>
<p>The waning activity in Ordinals trading suggests that the Bitcoin community might not be as enthusiastic about NFTs as initially thought. However, Dapprader notes that it may be premature to dismiss Bitcoin&#8217;s potential role in the dynamic NFT arena.</p>
<p>The researchers further conclude by saying the meteoric rise and subsequent fall of Bitcoin Ordinals spotlight the capricious nature of the NFT market. For those enticed to ride the wave of the newest trend, the dip in Ordinals serves as a stark reminder of how fleeting speculative excitement can be.</p>
<p>Although Bitcoin NFTs harbor great theoretical potential, sheer hype might not be enough to keep market frenzies alive. Dappradar researchers suggest to ensure the Ordinals setback is viewed as a lesson rather than a terminal blow, it&#8217;s imperative for developers to zero in on fostering tangible utility, enabling Bitcoin NFTs to truly realize their promise.</p>
