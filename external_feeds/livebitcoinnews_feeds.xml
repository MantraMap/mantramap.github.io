<li>Bitcoin price is attempting a fresh increase from the $25,400 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $26,500 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $26,300 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $26,400 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is rising from $25,400 against the US Dollar. BTC might eye another increase if the bulls remain active above the $26,400 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-soon-revisit-28500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">remained well-bid</a> above the $25,400 level. A base was formed and the price was able to avoid more losses below the $25,400 level. The bulls remained active and were able to slowly push the price above the $26,000 level.</p>
<p>There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $27,402 swing high to the $25,385 low. Bitcoin price is now trading below $26,500 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-key-resistance-near-28-5k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $27,200 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $26,300 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair. The trend line is just below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $27,402 swing high to the $25,385 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance might be near the $26,640 zone. A clear move above the $26,400 and $26,640 resistance levels might send the price toward $27,500.</p>
<p>Any more gains might push the price toward the $28,000 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a fresh decline below the $26,000 level. The first major support is near $25,550. The next key support is near the $25,400 level, below which the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $25,000 level in the coming sessions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been many <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/whats-really-making-bitcoin-spike-analysts-weigh-in/" data-wpel-link="internal">bank failures as of</a> late. The good news – according to several analysts – is that bitcoin is not only <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/02/bitcoin-survived-svb-and-silvergate-bank-fails-it-will-survive-first-republics-too/?sh=243ec6d466d0" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">going to survive the onslaught</a>, but it will come out with a bright, shining halo over its head at the end.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is a Fighter</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, several financial institutions – such as Signature and Silicon Valley Bank – are crashing, and not long ago, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/us-stocks-close-lower-after-first-republic-falls-and-ahead-of-the-fed-s-2-day-policy-meeting/ar-AA1aBzkU" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">First Republic joined the</a> group. Enkeo Knorr – co-founder of Hong Kong-based financial firm Stabolut and the BTC-backed stable coin USB – said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anything can happen still, according to the many voices from government agencies that don’t understand crypto and want it to die. We are very worried about how things [will] evolve in the upcoming weeks. The future of crypto is being decided now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jahon Jamali – CEO of American Crypto Academy – said if bitcoin can survive the falling of Signature Bank, it can survive anything. Jamali stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Signature Bank’s failure, in the view of many crypto investors, was less about the bank’s viability and more about limiting the on and off ramps for institutional digital asset investors. This (failure) may have a limiting effect on Wall Street’s continued participation in crypto, but it might also have the reverse effect and increase demand among retail crypto investors who might rush into bitcoin fearing increased restrictions to purchase it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Knorr further stated that bitcoin is likely to at least stay put in terms of its price for some time. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>To me, there is a clear and coordinated crackdown on crypto, with Silvergate and Signature Bank as the first victims. Banks should get into crypto by buying exchanges as it’s a very good business with huge potential, but they’re not going to do it because they want to get along well with the Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nobody wants them as enemies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Praveen Buddiga – co-founder of the Terareum Hybrid crypto exchange – doesn’t agree with this sentiment. He believes banks will soon come after crypto trading platforms and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>These bank collapses have opened up an opportunity for traditional [banks] like JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, or even Goldman Sachs to be the first traditional finance entity to either buy a pre-existing decentralized exchange or platform or generate one as a subdivision.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto Takes on New Form</h2>
<p>Bryan Legend – co-founder of blockchain development company OOXY Labs – thinks Silicon Valley Bank fell for a reason separate from the fact that it was connected to crypto. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fall out of SVB bank together with deep debt at traditional banks has cast a dark shadow over them. Investors want to safeguard their wealth. Bitcoin is one of the blue chips of crypto and will protect them in these turbulent times.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other assets have experienced certain degrees of healing in the year 2023, a big turnaround from the previous 12 months, though <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/02/all-bets-are-off-looming-314-trillion-crypto-price-earthquake-could-be-about-to-hit-bitcoin-and-ethereum/?sh=67cea7d64417" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the fact remains that the</a> Fed is still looking into hiking rates, and another rate jump could be right around the corner.</p>
<h2>The Fed Could Hike Rates Again</h2>
<p>It appears many traders and investors are watching these primary crypto assets with very careful eyes given they’re worried about the prices of these assets and others again sinking to new lows with the Fed looking to hike rates further as early as in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Also, the U.S. is facing issues with its present debt ceiling. The country is in danger of potentially losing further cash and being fully broke soon, and Janet Yellen – the current Treasury Secretary – is saying the ceiling must be raised if America is to maintain its present level of functionality.</p>
<p>During all this, you have individuals like Geoff Kendrick – head of foreign exchange research at Standard Chartered – suggesting that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-last-years-crypto-winter-over-analysts-say-yup/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin would wind up reaching</a> a new high of about $100K per unit. This is because cash in the U.S. and abroad is no longer seen as the stable, staple fiat currency it once was, and people are looking to transition their money into other outlets so they can maintain their wealth during times of economic strife.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The optimal trade would probably be long bitcoin, short Ethereum. That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yellen is warning that the U.S. could run out of money soon and that this would ultimately rattle the global economy in ways nobody has ever thought possible. She explained in a note to Congress:</p>
<blockquote><p>After reviewing recent federal tax receipts, our best estimate is that we will be unable to continue to satisfy all of the government’s obligations by early June, and potentially as early as June 1, if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, the Fed has explained that interest rates could soon be at a whopping 5.25 percent, the highest they’ve been since the year 2006. Antoni Trenchev – co-founder and managing partner at crypto lender Nexo – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investors are focused on what the Fed does Wednesday. If the Fed indicates it’s not done raising rates, all bets are off for crypto and other risk assets.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Is BTC Being Viewed More Positively?</h2>
<p>Simon Peters of e-Toro fame also threw his two cents in, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin’s rally has taken something of a new aspect in 2023. Unlike last year, where the crypto asset took losses alongside economic worries and general pullbacks in investment markets, bitcoin has become something of a rallying point for investors and seems to be living up to its ‘digital gold’ character [now].</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Biden and his fellow group of nation haters are once <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/biden-proposes-30-climate-change-tax-on-cryptocurrency-mining/ar-AA1aDihK" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">again setting their sights</a> on cryptocurrency. Biden is asking Congress to pass a new 30 percent tax on all crypto mining operations.</p>
<h2>Biden is Again Attacking Crypto</h2>
<p>The goal is to allegedly prevent climate change and stop the crypto mining arena from having a drastic impact on the environment. There have been many <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">reports published over</a> the past several years suggesting crypto mining is putting Mother Earth on a terrible path that will be irreversible once it reaches a certain point.</p>
<p>Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) said in a recent blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto miners’ high-energy consumption has negative spillovers on the environment, quality of life, and electricity grids where these firms locate across the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>They tout the move as a means of fighting the ongoing energy crisis in America and to stop the atmosphere from allegedly suffering more than it already has. The blog continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, crypto mining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate. The DAME tax encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Biden and his team say this will save the planet, given his past actions against crypto and those who use digital assets, one can’t help but assume this is just another attempt to bring the industry down for good. Thus far, Biden has implemented verbiage into <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-amendment-for-infrastructure-bill-leads-to-more-problems-and-infighting/" data-wpel-link="internal">infrastructure bills specifically</a> targeting crypto users.</p>
<p>Also, he has sought to implement old Obama-era <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-biden-using-an-obama-era-program-to-ban-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">financial policy that would</a> prevent crypto businesses from gaining access to traditional banking services and products. These – among many other things – suggest Biden has never been a fan of crypto traders, and he’s doing all he can to ensure they don’t have a future in his America.</p>
<p>Now that he wants to tax crypto mining businesses at 30 percent – a whopping number – his anti-crypto agenda is taking stronger form.</p>
<h2>Not Everyone Likes the Idea</h2>
<p>There are several critics of the proposal that say the mining industry is being unfairly targeted by Biden. Tom Mapes – director of energy policy at the Chamber of Digital Commerce – said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>This puts a clear line in the sand that they do not like the industry. They are looking for ways to hamstring it. This is just a way to go after the industry which they do not support… It seems like there’s an outsized focus on us… Millions of people are using this to transact around the world. It’s an opportunity for the unbanked or underbanked to bank, and it’s a way to send money across borders without having to pay a middleman.</p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is recovering higher above $0.25 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-soon-revisit-28500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.278 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano price saw a major decline from well above $0.350 against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair traded below the $0.32 and $0.30 support levels to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The bears even pushed the price below $0.25. A low is formed near $0.230 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $0.245 and $0.250 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3820 swing high to the $0.2300 low.</p>
<p>ADA price is now trading below $0.30 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-risk-of-more-downsides-below-0-34/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.278 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.278 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.300 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3820 swing high to the $0.2300 low. A clear move above the $0.300 resistance might start a strong increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise toward the $0.350 resistance.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.260 level. The next major support is near the $0.250 level. A clear move below the $0.250 level might send the price toward the $0.220 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $0.212 support, below which the bears could aim for a test of $0.200.</p>

<li>ETH price is now trading below $1,800 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,775 on the 4-hour chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below $1,775 and $1,800.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is declining below $1,800 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $1,720 support zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ethereum started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-turns-red-below-1850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">fresh decline</a> below $1,850 against the US Dollar. ETH price moved into a bearish zone below the $1,800 level.</p>
<p>There was a sharp move below the $1,780 level. A low was formed near $1,716 before the price started an upside correction. The price climbed a few points higher above the $1,750 level. There was a spike above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,898 swing high to the $1,716 low.</p>
<p>However, the price is still trading below $1,800 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-eyes-upside-break-above-1920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $1,760 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $1,775 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,775 on the 4-hour chart. A clear move above the $1,800 resistance or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,898 swing high to the $1,716 low.</p>
<p>Any more gains could even send the price toward the $1,850 resistance zone or even $2,000 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $1,720 level. The next major support is now near the $1,700 level. A break below the $1,700 support could push the price to $1,640. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,640 support, the price might decline toward $1,600.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance head Changpeng Zhao has taken to Twitter to warn Justin Sun – the main executive behind crypto firm Tron – against <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/binance-warns-blockchain-whale-justin-sun-of-the-consequences-over-sui-token-grab/ar-AA1aAMzd" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">using his own funds</a> to garner the exchange’s new SUI tokens.</p>
<h2>Zhao to Sun: Your Money&#8217;s Not Welcome!</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/changpeng-zhao/" data-wpel-link="internal">Zhao</a> has made it clear that these units are designed more for retail traders and that he doesn’t want “whales” (individuals with wallets stuffed to the gills with specific kinds of crypto) taking over the industry or dominating new tokens. He wants to make sure all crypto assets are distributed fairly and equally amongst users. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the Launch Pool Sui token, we will &#8216;take action against it.&#8217; SMH. Binance Launch Pool[s] are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales. On the bright side, blockchains are transparent.</p></blockquote>
<p>When it first came to the scene, crypto was built to establish a degree of fairness amongst financial players that wasn’t being seen in the world of traditional finance. Many standard banks have too much control over who gains access to assets and services. Things like one’s credit history, job history, and other elements can all get in the way, and those behind crypto wanted to see a few changes thrown into the mix.</p>
<p>When it comes to crypto, your background doesn’t really matter. All you really need is a digital wallet and an internet connection and you can use, buy, trade, and sell assets as you see fit. There are no prying eyes, middlemen, or third parties involved to go against you or say what you can and cannot do. Crypto provides autonomy, independence, and a democratic financial status.</p>
<p>However, these principles haven’t always been at the forefront of trading activities, as many individuals and institutions have sought to gather up as much crypto as they can to ensure their wealth remains steadily growing. Sadly, this has cut out many smaller players who either cannot gain access to the units in question or who can no longer afford them thanks to ongoing buys.</p>
<h2>Not Interested in Exchange Promotions</h2>
<p>Sun defended his actions against Zhao, saying he is not one to blatantly take part in exchange promotions. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a partner market maker for TUSD, TRON DAO Venture&#8217;s primary objective in depositing TUSD is to facilitate market-making between leading TUSD exchanges, thereby enhancing liquidity and trading volume, rather than participating in any exchange promotions. In just the past few hours, our market maker has achieved a total trading volume of 40 million USD, contributing to the stability of TUSD&#8217;s price.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also stated that many of his team members who had already purchased units of the new coins weren’t aware that they were part of a specific exchange campaign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Coinbase is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/coinbase-offers-a-fiery-response-to-the-secs-threat-of-enforcement-action/ar-AA1arecC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">upping its fight against</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company received a Wells notice <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">from the federal agency</a> over a month ago, and it’s not happy that Gary Gensler and his cronies are targeting its operations.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Vs. the SEC: Who Will Win?</h2>
<p>A Wells notice doesn’t necessarily mean that a company is being charged with a crime. Rather, it’s a warning or indication that charges are likely coming, and thus the company may want to consult with a legal team to get itself prepared.</p>
<p>Coinbase took serious issue with the notice given it has allegedly met with the SEC over 30 times in the past nine years as a means of always familiarizing itself with present laws and trying to stay compliant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the SEC has made it clear it does not care about which crypto companies are following rules or not. It’s simply going after any digital currency company it can as a means of making a statement. The SEC doesn’t want crypto around, and it’ll do just about anything to end the industry in America once and for all.</p>
<p>Coinbase issued a statement in May claiming that if the SEC was dumb enough to charge it with a crime or go against it in some way, it would work against the agency and pose “major programmatic risks.” The company also said that the SEC would “fail on the merits.”</p>
<p>The statement also mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase does not list, clear, or effect trading in securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Legal compliance officer for the exchange Paul Grewal also said to separate news sources:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the time when we went public, we had detailed discussions with the SEC about the very aspects of our business that are now — two years later — the subject of the Wells notice. Nothing has changed.</p></blockquote>
<p>He stated that the SEC reviewed all forms when it went public and that it could have denied the company’s plans back in 2021.</p>
<p>The SEC had developed a reputation for being a bully when it comes to crypto, or any companies involved in the digital currency arena. Not long ago, Kraken – a popular trading platform based in Northern California – was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">the subject of SEC scrutiny</a> that saw it lose more than $30 million in penalty fees. It was also forced to cease all staking activities and services.</p>
<h2>Nothing&#8217;s Changed!</h2>
<p>Coinbase is claiming total innocence in the present matter and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase&#8217;s retail staking services fail all four prongs of the Howey test. The SEC generally does not acknowledge the existence or non-existence of any investigation unless or until charges are filed. Coinbase has never wanted to litigate with the Commission. The Commission should not want to litigate either. Litigation will put the Commission&#8217;s own actions on trial.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cross River Bank (CRB) – a crypto-friendly financial institution stationed in New Jersey – has angered the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It’s <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2023/04/206316-cross-river-bank-target-of-fdic-enforcement-action/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">claiming that the bank</a> hasn’t done enough to keep traders’ and customers’ assets safe.</p>
<h2>The FDIC Targets Cross River Bank</h2>
<p>The FDIC is now taking enforcement action against the bank. This action has been accepted by Cross River’s board of directors. The order was filed in early March, but for some reason, failed to make it into the news until now. The order states the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FDIC considered the matter and determined, and the Bank neither admits [nor] denies, that it engaged in the unsafe or unsound banking practices related to its compliance with applicable fair lending laws and regulations by failing to establish and maintain internal controls, information systems, and prudent credit underwriting practices.</p></blockquote>
<p>CRB has been ordered by the FDIC to boost the supervision of its management team. This means the institution must implement internal controls and credit underwriting to ensure all compliance measures are met through its lending program. In addition, the company must also assume all responsibility for transactions regardless of their sizes or the assets involved.</p>
<p>The FDIC is clearly worried that another crypto-based bank could wind up in the dunk tank like so many others have in recent weeks. America is in the middle of its worst banking crisis since the Great Recession of 2008, and more failed institutions could bring the U.S. to its knees.</p>
<p>Among the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">institutions that have crashed</a> and burned as of late are Silicon Valley Bank, Signature, and Silvergate. Other institutions, such as Credit Suisse, were practically on the verge of death, but were saved at the last minute through buyouts. Not long ago, problems <a href="https://thehill.com/business/3911002-what-to-know-about-first-republic-bank/#:~:text=First%20Republic%20Bank%20is%20the%20latest%20financial%20institution,two%20weeks%20as%20large%20depositors%20pulled%20their%20funds." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">arose for companies</a> like First Republic.</p>
<h2>Working with Several Fintech Clients</h2>
<p>An anonymous spokesperson for CRB has stated that the bank has not admitted to any wrongdoing, though it’s not denying anything either. They said that the institution is looking forward to working with the FDIC and implementing appropriate safety measures. They mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we know, CRB is one of the foundational banks during the fintech renaissance period and partners with some of the first and biggest fintech players in existence. CRB has a very short period to answer some tough questions from the FDIC, and to do it properly with all their fintech partners. It’s [a] tall order by any measure. Every fintech partner may have to provide their individual practices with respect to Cross River’s offerings to complete the major tasks within the consent order, and it will have a large ripple effect across the industry.  One of the most difficult tasks to complete is to show to the FDIC that the bank and their partners are following fair lending laws and regulations.</p></blockquote>
