<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Sushiswap developers have submitted a new governance proposal to the community.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The proposal seeks to divert 100% of fees generated on the platform to Sushi&rsquo;s multisig.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The funds would be used for Sushi&rsquo;s multisig for a year or until new tokenomics are implemented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Sushiswap developers want to divert trading fees</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Developers of the decentralised finance (DeFi) protocol, Sushiswap, have submitted a new proposal to the community.&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.sushi.com/t/reinstated-increase-kanpai-treasury-allocation-to-100/11475" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According to the proposal</u></a>, 100% of the fees generated on the platform would be diverted to Sushi&rsquo;s multisig for one year or until new tokenomics are implemented.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> comes as Sushiswap is currently facing a significant deficit in its treasury. The deficit threatens the protocol&rsquo;s long-term operational viability.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In his proposal, the Head Chef, Jared Gray, said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;After reviewing expenditures, it&rsquo;s clear that a significant deficit in the Treasury threatens Sushi&rsquo;s operational viability, requiring an immediate remedy. In my original proposal, Sushi operated with an annual runway of 9M USD. However, after my detailed review, we reduced that requirement to 5M USD. We made the reduction possible by renegotiating infrastructure contracts, scaling back underperforming or superfluous dependencies, and instituting a budget freeze on non-critical personnel and infrastructure.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite reducing the project&rsquo;s annual runway requirement from $9 million to $5 million, the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The developers are now proposing to set up Kanpai, a fee-diversion protocol. The proposal, if accepted, will lead to 100% of fees diverted to the Treasury multisig for one year or until the project&rsquo;s new token distribution and reward schemes become active.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Sushiswap&rsquo;s fee-diversion solution is temporary</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The developers pointed out that the proposal is a temporary solution to a long-term problem. The proposal was put in place because new tokenomics will take time to implement</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Head Chef said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Kanpai is a temporary solution to a long-term problem, and a new tokenomics proposal is on the horizon, which will help address the long-term value proposition of Sushi for stakeholders. Sushi must implement a holistic token model that allows the rebuilding of the Treasury and delivers value for all stakeholders while reducing the fiscal liability carried solely by the protocol.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to Kanpai, the Sushi team said it increased its funding by securing several multi-million dollar partner deals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the developers added that relying on business development deals is only part of a successful business model to secure Sushi&rsquo;s future. In October, asset management firm&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/asset-management-firm-goldentree-invests-5-2-million-in-sushiswap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GoldenTree invested $5.2 million</u></a> in Sushiswap.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">League of Kingdom Arena is a Decentraland competitor.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It combines the concepts of gaming with NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The number of active users in its ecosystem has dropped.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">LOKA price has held quite well in the past few days even as user growth in the ecosystem dropped. League of Kingdom&rsquo;s token rose to a high of $0.5342, which was the highest level since December 1. It has jumped by over 87% from the lowest level in November.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is League of Kingdom Arena and why is it rising?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Gaming and NFTs are two of the biggest use cases for the blockchain industry. Their popularity grew during the Covid-19 pandemic as&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/"><u>cryptocurrency</u></a> prices surged and as people remained locked up in their homes. Some of the top blockchain gaming ecosystems were Sandbox and Decentraland.</p>
<p dir="ltr">League of Kingdom Arena is a blockchain gaming and&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/non-fungible-token-nft/"><u>NFT</u></a> platform built on Ethereum and accelerated in Polygon. In it, the participants fight for dominion and win rewards as they go up the ladder. In addition, since it is a decentralised ecosystem, people can easily participate in their governance by buying LOKA coins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are other ways to participate in the League of Kingdom Arena. For example, you can buy your virtual land, which is viewed as a virtual piece of real estate. Holders of this land earn Ethereum rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, users can adopt Drago and start earning $DST coins. The Drag Soul Token is similar to Axie Infinity&rsquo;s Smooth Love Potion, which is used to fuel the ecosystem. Also, you can buy the LOKA token and take part in its governance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">LOKA price has done well in the past few weeks even as its ecosystem growth has engaged reverse gear. In the past 30 days, the <a href="https://dappradar.com/multichain/games/league-of-kingdoms/"><u>number</u></a> of unique active wallets (UAW) in its ecosystem has dropped by 13% to 2,000.

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bitizen Wallet integrates with KyberSwap Aggregator</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">KNC, the native token of the Kyber Network, has been underperforming over the past few hours. The token has lost roughly 7% of its value in the last 24 hours but could rally higher soon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The poor performance comes despite Bitizen&rsquo;s adoption. Kyber Network announced a few hours ago that Bitizen Wallet has integrated with its KyberSwap Aggregator.</p>
<p dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr">Thanks to this <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a>, Bitizen users can now get the best rates when they swap on KyberSwap.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">KNC&rsquo;s poor performance is in line with the broader cryptocurrency market. The crypto market has lost roughly 2% of its value in the last 24 hours, and the total crypto market cap now stands at $839 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has been struggling below the $17k level since the start of the week. The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> remains below $17k after losing 1% of its value in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Key levels to watch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The KNC/USD has turned bearish as Kyber Network has been underperforming over the last few hours. The technical indicators show that the broader crypto market is outperforming KNC at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">The MACD line dipped into the negative zone a few hours ago, indicating that the bears have taken control of the market. The 14-day RSI of 41 shows that KNC is heading into the oversold region if the the bearish trend continues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, KNC is trading at $0.6281 per coin. KNC could drop below the $0.5785 support level in the near term if the current market conditions persist. Unless the market conditions improve, KNC could test the $0.5402 support level in the near term.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Bitizen&rsquo;s adoption, KNC could recover and rally toward the $0.6995 resistance level over the next few hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Most of the people in the crypto world were guilty of the sin of shitcoinery, he added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Saylor is a Bitcoin maximalist and has bought bitcoins worth billions of dollars over the years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Saylor is only a fan of Bitcoin</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Michael Saylor, the MicroStrategy executive chairman and major Bitcoin bull, has stated that the entire FTX fiasco was unethical and illegal from the very beginning. He revealed this during a recent interview, maintaining his position as a Bitcoin maximalist.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The former CEO of MicroStrategy stated that for years, &nbsp;has been a low-grade &ldquo;boiling Guerrilla war&rdquo; between the Bitcoin community and the broader crypto community over industry practices, including what he repeatedly calls, &ldquo;shitcoinery.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Saylor, Sam Bankman-Fried was the poster child of the crypto community. He stated that</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;There is something ethically broken about being able to issue your own unregistered security. Sam and most of the people in the crypto world were always guilty of the sin of shitcoinery.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Saylor attributed the behaviours such as promoting shitcoins to his perceptions of the crypto community&rsquo;s inherent problems, which are greed, arrogance and foolishness.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>FTX&rsquo;s collapse remains the major topic of discussion in the crypto space</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy roughly a month ago, but its collapse remains the major topic of discussion in the crypto space. This was because FTX was one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world prior to its collapse and was processing around $4 billion in daily trading volume.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last week, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, said Sam Bankman-Fried is&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/sam-was-delusional-about-what-happened-says-mike-novogratz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delusional about what happened</u></a>. He added that SBF was responsible for what happened to the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The former FTX CEO was invited to testify before the United States House Financial Services Committee. However, he replied that he would eventually appear before the committee&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/i-will-testify-before-the-united-states-congress-says-sam-bankman-fried/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>after reviewing FTX&rsquo;s collapse</u></a>.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, SBF&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/testimony-from-the-new-ftx-ceo-john-j-ray-iii-is-false-says-sam-bankman-fried/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also stated</u></a> that the statements made by the new FTX CEO John J Ray III, were false.&nbsp;</p>

What does it mean for stablecoin market?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinjournal.net">CoinJournal</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Circle, issuer of USDC, has cancelled a plan to go public in a $9 billion deal</li>
<li>Public listing could have presented USDC as the anti-Tether, pushing a fully transparent and audited angle</li>
<li>Cancelled deal reflects pulldown in prices across the board</li>
<li>Circle remain determined to go public eventually, but in the interim, will continue to fight the stablecoin war vs rivals</li>
<li>Binance the recent big mover after the exchange delisted USDC and other rivals in order to push its own stablecoin, BUSD</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stablecoin group Circle have abandoned plans to go public.</p>
<p>Issuer of USDC, the stablecoin with a $43 billion marketcap, Circle had planned to go public with a valuation of $9 billion. Sam Bankman-Fried and the crypto markets had other ideas, however.</p>
<h2><strong>Abandoned plan signifies crypto collapse</strong></h2>
<p>The collapse of the deal shows how far crypto has fallen. The deal was initially struck in July 2021, with Circle planning on going public via a blank-cheque company headed by Bob Diamond, a former Barclays executive.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are disappointed the proposed transaction timed out; however, becoming a public company remains part of Circle&rsquo;s core strategy to enhance trust and transparency, which has never been more important,&rdquo; said Jeremy Allaire, Circle chief executive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a surprise. Deals to go public have been shelved across the market &ndash; not just crypto &ndash; as interest rates rises have pulled prices down across the board. Look no further than Coinbase for evidence of the damage, with their shares down 84% in 2022 (I wrote a deep dive on their demise <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/what-is-wrong-with-coinbase-ceo-selling-2-of-stake-a-deep-dive/">here</a>).</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12090035">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2><strong>Public security desirable for stablecoins</strong></h2>
<p>The stablecoin space is one which has been hurt more than most this year. There was the high-profile <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/luna-why-i-sold-my-ust-for-95-cents-on-the-dollar-today/">collapse of UST</a> in May, pulling down large chunks of the ecosystem with it.</p>
<p>DAI is struggling mightily, in the curious position of being a decentralised stablecoin that is very centralised (given its holdings of USDC). Its latest plan is to abandon the peg model completely, swapping over to a free-floating stablecoin, which reads as a complete paradox if you ask me.</p>
<p>But it is the continued speculation over the safety of Tether (deep dive <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/im-sick-of-talking-about-tether-but-heres-an-article-about-tether/">here</a>), which itself de-pegged to 95 cents on several exchanges in the aftermath of the UST collapse, that remains as the biggest gripe on stablecoins.</p>
<p>This is where USDC could really have benefitted from Circle going public. The security, disclosures and transparency that being a public company demands are unrivalled. The move would have massively benefitted Cicle&rsquo;s image, especially in comparison to its biggest rival, Tether.</p>
<p>It could really have positioned itself as the anti-Tether, the fully public, and therefore audited, transparent and secure, stablecoin. The biggest winner of this news of the collapsed deal, therefore, is undoubtedly Tether.</p>
<h2><strong>The stablecoin war continues</strong></h2>
<p>One hopes that Circle will go public eventually. I&rsquo;m sure it will, but that may be a while, looking at the state of the markets, with inflation yet to significantly cool off and the world economy struggling as Europe and the US dive deeper into winter amidst a suffocating energy crisis.</p>
<p>Until then, it will continue to fight its rivals for market dominance. The most recent victor in all this has been Binance&rsquo;s stablecoin, BUSD, after the exchange delisted USDC and several other competitors from its exchange.</p>
<p>USDC was meant to have the trump card that it is a public listing up its sleeve. But now that that&rsquo;s been cancelled, it is back to the drawing board with regards to the stablecoin war.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Right now, metaverse tokens make up <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/metaverse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>some of the largest</u></a> and most successful projects in the world of crypto. Now is definitely the time to think about going big in crypto for seeing big gains in return. There are loads of coins set to jump in value but few, if any, can match the upside potential of Metacade&rsquo;s native token, MCADE.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE is uniquely positioned for an upswing in value when the crypto bull market returns. Here&rsquo;s an explanation of <strong>why Metacade could 20x its value</strong> below, so keep reading to learn more.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is poised to be Web3&rsquo;s first community arcade with a selection of games on offer. It&rsquo;s a gathering place in the metaverse where gamers can come together to hang out and try out the latest GameFi projects. It&rsquo;s also a space where gamers can connect directly with game developers to be part of the development of new games.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is putting the greatest GameFi projects, community events, and fellow gamers into a single place that everyone can access. <strong>This grand, comprehensive vision is what makes Metacade&rsquo;s potential so massive</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE is the token that powers the <a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> universe. It is used for governance of the project and to involve the community in the direction Metacade goes in. It&rsquo;s what people will use to pay for games, enter competitive tournaments, and post job listings among other things.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">What makes Metacade so Different?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Most GameFi projects only offer a single game title that gamers either like or dislike. Other projects, like Decentraland and The Sandbox, offer users a unique platform but it gives them few gaming options. Metacade, however, is a place where gamers can access many games, which means <strong>everyone will be able to find something they want to play</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is also emerging as the central hub for play-to-earn gaming in the metaverse. This gives it an even larger total addressable market and significantly increases its upside potential. And as P2E gaming grows, that potential is only expected to grow along with it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team behind Metacade is also planning to transition into a DAO, turning over control of the project to the community once it&rsquo;s been established. This could turn it into a truly decentralized hub for everything that Web3 gaming has to offer.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why MCADE Could 20x Its Value</h2>
<p dir="ltr">To understand why MCADE could 20x its value, it&rsquo;s important to lay down some figures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE is currently conducting its presale, which has 9 phases. Prices began at $0.008 per token and will gradually rise until they reach $0.02 per token at the end of phase 9. The maximum total supply of MCADE is 2 billion with 1.4 billion tokens available at presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taking these figures ($0.02/token x 1.4 billion MCADE supply), we get a <strong>market cap at the end of presale of just over $28 million</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A $28 million market cap is just the starting point. A 20x from that level would <strong>lead to Metacade having a market cap of about $560 million</strong>. Or, put another way, each token would go from $0.02 after the presale to about $0.40, if a $560 million market cap is reached.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Is a 20x realistic?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE needs to reach $0.40 in order to achieve a 20x jump, so it&rsquo;s time to ask if that level of growth is realistic. The easiest way to do this is by comparing Metacade to other projects in this general niche.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/decentraland" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Decentraland</u></a> reached a market cap of nearly $7 billion at its peak, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/fr/pi%C3%A8ces/the-sandbox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Sandbox</u></a> reached a nearly $10 billion market cap peak. Other projects, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/fr/pi%C3%A8ces/defi-kingdoms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DeFi Kingdoms</u></a>, reached more than a $1 billion market cap during their market cap peaks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bottom line is that there are more than a handful of projects in the general GameFi/metaverse space that surpassed a $560 million valuation during the last crypto bull market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That means it&rsquo;s likely that more will happen again in the future. The question is whether Metacade will be one of them or not. And right now, all signs say that it definitely will be.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Pick Up Your MCADE Today</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is an emerging project with sky-high potential. Metacade can absolutely reach the $560 million market cap that it needs to achieve a 20x from presale levels. This is because it&rsquo;s already standing out as one of the most innovative projects in crypto. It has an extremely large potential audience and is starting at a low enough valuation to make a return on your investment more than possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just don&rsquo;t wait too long. You may not be able to take advantage of these early-bird prices for very much longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The co-founder of Gemini, Cameron Winklevoss, on Wednesday announced via a <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1600210788219637760">series of tweets</a> that the crypto exchange has launched a page to help Gemini Earn users.</p>
<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gemini Earn was impacted after crypto lender Genesis paused withdrawals and Earn redemptions.</li>
<li>Genesis is Gemini&rsquo;s lending partner and it is facing liquidity issues amid the FTX crisis.</li>
<li>Gemini has also formed a creditors&rsquo; committee and hired the law firm, Kirkland &amp; Ellis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The newly launched page will help bring transparency process regarding finding a resolution for all Earn users to redeem their funds.</p>
<p>In addition, the exchange has also formed a creditor&rsquo;s committee which will be tasked with trying to recover lost money. They have also hired the law firm, Kirkland &amp;Ellis, to help resolve the issues around the Earn product the earliest possible.</p>
<h2>Genesis&rsquo; impact on Gemini Earn</h2>
<p>Genesis and its parent company DCG are currently trying to raise about half a billion in emergency funding due to its exposure to the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/expect-crypto-contagion-as-ftx-crisis-is-far-from-over/">collapse FTX</a> crypto exchange. DCG also owes Genesis about $1.7 billion. As a result, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/genesis-2-8b-crypto-lending-unit-halts-withdrawals/">Genesis halted withdrawals</a> and Gemini Earn redemptions and has not given any updates on when the services will resume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As a result of halting the Gemini Earn redemptions, Genesis owes Gemini Earn users $900 million and Gemini is currently trying to recover those funds to help gain their customers&rsquo; trust which has been greatly impacted by the developments.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Synthetix token extended weekly gains on Tuesday by adding another 6%</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token trades below a descending trendline</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bears may attempt to force a correction if buyers weaken at $2.0</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/synthetix/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Synthetix token price</u></a> (SNX/USD) initiated an accelerated recovery on Tuesday, jumping by an intraday of 6%. The token&rsquo;s value has now increased by double digits in the past week. The recovery happens from the November lows of $1.57. The cryptocurrency was trading at $1.91 as of press time. Is it too early to make a bull call?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fundamentally, SNX is earning bullish momentum from a slightly improved crypto sentiment. Most&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a> traded in the green in the past week despite falling slightly in the last 24 hours. The recoveries in SNX, however, face a snag as the cryptocurrency heads for resistance at the descending trendline.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SNX meets resistance at the descending trendline</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/06/1670365555150-5e41f0e5-0fd8-4c3c-aa75-8c4ff49ca2e3.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="319"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SNXUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SNX/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Technical indicators are bullish for SNX. The MACD indicator initiated a bullish crossover, despite remaining in the bear zone. The RSI shows improving momentum, and the reading has moved above the 50 midpoint level. That suggests a high demand for SNX.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SNX buyers now face a test at the descending trendline. That should coincide with a price of $2, implying that bulls could remain in control for at least one or two days.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SNX concluding thoughts</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Although SNX buyers could remain in control, for now, bulls must overcome bears at the descending trendline. The price is already facing a correction as it approaches the crucial dynamic resistance level.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If bulls recover above the crucial zone, $2.7 is the next potential resistance for SNX. Conversely, a rejection at the descending trendline could pit SNX back to the $1.5 bottom.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Where to buy SNX</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"></p><h3>
