<p>AirSwap is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for intermediaries or a centralized exchange. AirSwap is built on the principles of decentralization, privacy, and security.</p>



<p>The platform utilizes smart contracts to facilitate token swaps between parties. Instead of placing orders on a traditional order book, AirSwap uses a protocol called the Swap Protocol. This protocol enables users to signal their intent to trade and find counterparties through off-chain negotiation. Once the trading terms are agreed upon, the actual token transfer occurs on the Ethereum blockchain through a peer-to-peer atomic swap.</p>



<p>One of the key features of AirSwap is its focus on privacy. The platform does not require users to create accounts or provide personal information, enhancing anonymity and protecting user privacy. Additionally, AirSwap does not hold custody of user funds during the trading process, further mitigating the risk of theft or hacks.</p>



<p>AirSwap has its native ERC-20 utility token called AST, which can be used to access additional features and services within the AirSwap ecosystem. The token plays a role in signaling trade intent, creating liquidity pools, and incentivizing market makers.</p>

<p>AirSwap operates on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes a decentralized protocol called the Swap Protocol. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step explanation of how AirSwap works:</p>



<ol>
<li>Intent to Trade: A user who wishes to trade a particular cryptocurrency token signals their intent to trade by broadcasting it off-chain. This intent is expressed by creating an order that includes the details of the desired trade, such as the token, the quantity, and any specific trading conditions.</li>



<li>Indexer: employs an Indexer, which is a distributed network that helps users discover potential counterparties for their trades. The Indexer maintains an index of available orders and facilitates the matching of buyers and sellers.</li>



<li>Order Matching: The Indexer helps connect traders who have compatible orders. It searches for the best matches based on the desired token, quantity, and trading conditions. This matching process occurs off-chain, allowing for efficient and scalable order discovery.</li>



<li>Peer-to-Peer Atomic Swap: Once a suitable match is found, the traders engage in an off-chain negotiation to agree on the terms of the trade. They can communicate directly or through any chosen communication channel. This negotiation ensures that both parties are satisfied with the trade details.</li>



<li>On-Chain Settlement: After the off-chain negotiation, the actual token transfer occurs on the Ethereum blockchain through an on-chain settlement process called a peer-to-peer atomic swap. Atomic swaps ensure that either the entire trade is executed, or none of it takes place, minimizing the risk of partial or failed transactions.</li>



<li>Token Transfer: Using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, the tokens are securely transferred from one party&#8217;s wallet to the other party&#8217;s wallet. The execution of the swap is transparent, verifiable, and irreversible once recorded on the blockchain.</li>



<li>Privacy and Security: AirSwap prioritizes user privacy and security. The platform does not require users to create accounts or provide personal information, preserving anonymity. Furthermore, AirSwap does not hold custody of user funds during the trading process, reducing the risk of theft or hacks.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features of AirSwap</h2>



<p>AirSwap offers several features that distinguish it as a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange. Here are some notable features of AirSwap:</p>



<ol>
<li>Decentralized Trading: operates as a decentralized exchange, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for intermediaries. This eliminates the reliance on centralized exchanges, reducing counterparty risk and promoting peer-to-peer transactions.</li>



<li>Swap Protocol: utilizes the Swap Protocol, a decentralized protocol for trading ERC-20 tokens. The protocol enables off-chain negotiation and on-chain settlement, providing an efficient and secure trading experience.</li>



<li>Privacy and Anonymity: prioritizes user privacy by not requiring users to create accounts or provide personal information. The platform allows users to trade while maintaining their anonymity, enhancing privacy and security.</li>



<li>Non-Custodial Model: follows a non-custodial approach, meaning that it does not hold custody of user funds during the trading process. This reduces the risk of theft or hacking since users retain control of their tokens in their personal wallets until the trade settlement occurs on the blockchain.</li>



<li>User-Friendly Interface: aims to provide a user-friendly trading experience. The platform offers an intuitive interface that simplifies the process of creating, discovering, and executing trades. This makes it accessible to both experienced traders and newcomers to the cryptocurrency space.</li>



<li>ERC-20 Token Support: primarily focuses on ERC-20 tokens, which are tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain. It supports a wide range of ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to trade various cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem.</li>



<li>AST Token and Incentives: has its native ERC-20 utility token called AST. The AST token plays a role in signaling trade intent, creating liquidity pools, and incentivizing market makers. AST token holders can participate in governance and decision-making processes within the AirSwap ecosystem.</li>



<li>Community and Liquidity: has an active community of users and market makers who contribute to liquidity on the platform. Liquidity providers facilitate trades by offering tokens for trading, ensuring that there is sufficient depth in the market for smooth trading operations.</li>
</ol>

<li>Lower Liquidity: Compared to large centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges like AirSwap may have lower liquidity, which could result in wider bid-ask spreads and potentially impact trade execution.</li>



<li>Reliance on Ethereum Network: AirSwap operates on the Ethereum blockchain, and as such, its performance and transaction speed are dependent on the scalability and congestion of the Ethereum network. During periods of high network congestion, transactions on AirSwap may experience delays or higher fees.</li>



<li>Off-Chain Negotiation: The off-chain negotiation process used by AirSwap may introduce some complexities and require users to engage in direct communication or use additional communication channels to agree on trade terms.</li>



<li>Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. While AirSwap provides a platform for trading, users should still be aware of the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and fluctuations in token prices.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">AirSwap Fees</h2>



<p>AirSwap has a unique fee structure that differs from traditional centralized exchanges. Here&#8217;s an overview of the fee components associated with using AirSwap:</p>



<ol>
<li>Trading Fees: AirSwap does not charge any direct trading fees to users. When executing a trade on AirSwap, there are no transaction fees or commissions imposed by the platform itself. This distinguishes AirSwap from many centralized exchanges that typically charge trading fees based on the transaction volume or maker-taker models.</li>



<li>Gas Fees: As AirSwap operates on the Ethereum blockchain, users are subject to gas fees. Gas fees are required to pay for the computational resources and network fees associated with executing transactions on the Ethereum network.

<p>AirSwap prioritizes security and privacy to provide users with a secure and anonymous trading experience. Here&#8217;s an overview of AirSwap&#8217;s approach to security and privacy:</p>



<p>Security:</p>



<ol>
<li>Non-Custodial Model: AirSwap follows a non-custodial approach, which means it does not hold custody of user funds during the trading process. Users retain control of their tokens in their personal wallets until the trade settlement occurs on the blockchain. This reduces the risk of theft or hacking associated with centralized exchanges that hold user funds.</li>



<li>Smart Contract Audits: AirSwap has conducted audits of its smart contracts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Audits help ensure the reliability and security of the protocol by detecting and addressing any potential security weaknesses.</li>



<li>Emphasis on User Responsibility: AirSwap places responsibility on users to maintain the security of their wallets and private keys. Users are encouraged to follow best practices for securing their digital assets, such as using hardware wallets, keeping software and firmware up to date, and practicing good password management.</li>
</ol>



<p>Privacy:</p>



<ol>

<p>According to Wu blockchain, the Fantom network accounts for the highest proportion of Multichain&#8217;s $1.76 billion TVL, reaching 36.7%. The assets on the Fantom network are about $1.66 billion, and nearly 40% of the assets are wrapped assets of <a href="https://scan.multichain.org/#/charts/charts-home" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://scan.multichain.org/#/charts/charts-home" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multichain</a>. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>The main stablecoin on Fantom is 191 million USDC and 82 million USDT assets are issued by Multichain. Although Multichain is Fantom&#8217;s official cross-chain bridge, most chains operate normally, and there is no sign of a de-peg of USDC and USDT on Fantom.</p>



<p>Previously, a Twitter account known as &#8220;Ignas | DeFi Research&#8221; reported the rumors spreading on Twitter that the Multichain team had been arrested leading to a FUD resulting in a 5x increase in daily bridging volume. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Despite this, the bridging volumes do not show signs of panic. &#8220;An Ape&#8217;s Prologue&#8221; reported that Fantom is the most exposed to Multichain&#8217;s wrapped tokens. 35% of its TVL locked depends on these wrappers. Multichain issues 40% of non-$FTM assets ($650M) and handles 81% of Fantom&#8217;s total stablecoin MC. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Although the amount withdrawn was larger than deposited by $18M, it is only 1% of its total TVL of $1.78B USD. Not much panic was seen.</p>



<p>Fantom should have experienced a significant outflow of TVL due to its reliance on Multichain. Although TVL has dropped by 9.55% in USD, adjusting for the price of FTM, the data shows no significant outflow of capital. The clearest sign of panic is the Multichain LPs on Fantom. </p>



<p>A total of $33M USD has been withdrawn by LPs from Fantom, with only $1.7M in deposits. Multichain reported that &#8220;some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure&#8221; and that Kava, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM routes were temporarily suspended. Eighty-three transactions were pending for more than a day.</p>

<p>It is important to note that on-chain data does not reveal a massive capital outflow. However, the lack of communication from the team is worrying. The current Multichain CEO, Zhaojun, hasn&#8217;t been online in a week. </p>

<li><em>Its contract is already the third largest holder of &#8220;Fat Penguin&#8221; Pudgy Penguins NFT.</em></li>

<p>On-chain data analysis from <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/blur-dominates-82-of-the-nft-lending-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DappRadar</a> shows that NFT marketplace Blur&#8217;s lending platform Blend has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190034-blend-surges-from-4200-to-169900-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amassed</a> 169,900 ETH, equal to $308 million in loan volume, in the first 22 days after its inception. Blend now has an 82% market share on all NFT lending platforms, with a volume of $375 million.</p>



<p>Blend, as stated by the development team, is a lending solution that enables NFT holders to use their assets as collateral to borrow ETH from others. Blend, in particular, will link borrowers and lenders in a peer-to-peer model.</p>



<p>Blend has announced loan funding for a number of popular NFT projects, including Pudgy Penguins, Clone X, Otherdeeds, Bored Ape Kennel Club, Kanpai Pandas, and Redacted Remilio Babies.</p>



<p>Blur is a fast-growing rival to OpenSea and the world&#8217;s largest NFT exchange and aggregator. Even before the new Blend, Blur discovered ways to break away from typical NFT exchange trading techniques and spearheaded a paradigm shift with its order book function, vastly boosting convenience for NFT traders.</p>



<p>Not only that, the total value locked on the platform has reached a new high with over $26.5 million, which is a significant step forward for the fledgling NFT lending protocol.</p>

<p>Although Blend is growing strongly, it still comes with concerns because of the way the volume spike it brings, creating an unstable market and difficult to determine price movements.</p>



<p>Moreover, the issue of wash trading on Blur is still a hot topic. The DappRadar report notes that the above $19 million has been identified as wash trading in the past week alone. The exchange itself also had a grand launch with &#8220;huge&#8221; airdrops, but attracted most of the platform just for &#8220;interactive farming&#8221;, causing many people to question the real quality of the exchange.</p>

<p>FUDs continued to erupt after the failure of this bridge as some users noted the slowness of Multichain cross-chain transfers. The team explained that the main reason was due to the back-end side of the project.</p>



<p>On May 23, the project announced that the bridge was not available for some chains. The project is upgrading and repairing but the completion time has not been determined, the affected people will be compensated. But up to now the user money has not been paid. Some of the affected routes are Kava, zkSync &amp; Polygon zkEVM. However, most other remittance routes are still operating normally.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the previous Coincu News article, yesterday there were rumors that the CEO and CEO of Multichain, Zhao Jun, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/189724-multichain-co-founder-ceo-zhao-jun-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had suddenly disappeared</a> and cut off all communication.

<p>Before the questions raised, the project&#8217;s silence was the reason why many partners and investors decided to get out of this deep hole.</p>



<p>Lookonchain has detected the transfer of MULTI tokens to the Gate exchange by whale wallets. In addition, Fantom Foundation also had a strange move when withdrawing $ 2.4 million worth of MULTI tokens from the liquidity pool on SushiSwap.</p>

<p>The most recent outrage in the community was caused by a tweet from self-proclaimed crypto market investigator @BoringSleuth, which <a href="https://twitter.com/BoringSleuth/status/1661808784291889159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the probable foundation for a rug-pull. According to @BoringSleuth, Multichain now houses up to $1.8 billion in various digital currencies split across many networks.</p>



<p>The detective believes that if Multichain makes a move to take away all of the cash, which seems to be the case, the market&#8217;s devastating impact may be reversing.</p>



<p>Multichain previously stated that the majority of the Multichain protocol&#8217;s cross-chain routes are operational, but certain cross-chain routes are inaccessible due to force majeure, and the time to restore service is unclear. Customers complained that cash had been blocked in the bridge for many hours. The team reached an agreement to reimburse users for their losses.</p>



<p>The protocol vowed to reimburse customers for any losses incurred as a result of the incident, which community members think will not be maintained.</p>

<p>With the realization that the sector has seen countless scams and rug pulls, exchanges began taking the necessary safeguards to protect investors. Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1661649462387957760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took</a> one of the most aggressive measures in this situation by temporarily suspending deposits for bridging tokens associated with Multichain. The exchange may resume deposits only after receiving confirmation from the Multichain team.</p>



<p>But, @BoringSleuth is still <a href="https://twitter.com/BoringSleuth/status/1661848938280886277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspicious</a> about numerous prior rugs, as well as Binance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;There are rumors of an arrest &amp; some bridges are no longer working. I&#8217;m most suspicious though because of previous work I had done where they came, and stayed on my radar due to their teams connections to several previous rugs, and Binance.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On SushiSwap, Fantom Foundation <a href="https://twitter.com/apes_prologue/status/1661489464798072832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent</a> $2.4 million of the protocol&#8217;s native MULTI tokens. HashKey Group sent $250,000 to cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io, while Tron creator Justin Sun transferred 470,000 USDD stablecoin. The absence of Multichain cross-chain routes has the greatest impact on Fantom Foundation, followed by BSC and Optimist.</p>

<p>The constantly evolving world of cryptocurrency has once again caught the public&#8217;s attention with recent developments reported by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. One of the most notable events was when Ben.eth quote tweeted a phishing scam that caused his followers to lose around $170k. This incident has highlighted the importance of being vigilant and cautious when dealing with cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Another significant development was when 26 ETH was sent to the address involved in the andy8052 SIM swap and swatting attack last month. This event highlights the need for heightened security measures in the crypto world to protect users from malicious attacks.</p>

<p>A week ago, Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188281-bitboy-crypto-betrays-community-swapped/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/188281-bitboy-crypto-betrays-community-swapped/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that BitBoy Crypto, a popular digital currency YouTuber had sold all his BEN token holdings, according to ScopeProtocol. He had promised his community he would lock the fan tokens for six months, but the tokens were dumped just six days after the promise was made.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Lookonchain reported that two Machi Big Brother addresses spent 1,442 ETH ($2.6M) on buying 9.42M JIMBO at an average price of $0.2763, which is 14.1% of the total supply.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>On May 17th, Machi Big Brother purchased 9.96M JIMBO V1 with 823 ETH ($1.5M). However, due to contract issues, Machi Big Brother sold all of JIMBO V1 for 742 ETH ($1.35M) after V2 was launched, losing 81 ETH ($152K).</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Machi Big Brother is very bullish on Jimbos Protocol or if there is a partnership, or if Machi Big Brother is one of the founders.</p>

<p>Major local private banks such as Bradesco, Buffett-backed Nubank, and Ita Unibanco are on the list, as is Brazil&#8217;s biggest lender, Banco do Brasil, and the local stock market B3. Visa and Microsoft are among the multinational corporations that have agreed to engage in the initiative.</p>



<p>According to the Bank Central de Brazil website, 36 ideas were submitted for the pilot. Moreover, by the middle of June, the chosen participants will be included in the &#8220;Real Digital Pilot.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to prior reports, the Central Bank of Brazil announced in March this year the commencement of a CBDC pilot project, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2024.</p>



<p>The pilot is described by Brazil&#8217;s Central Bank as an experiment to examine the programmability advantages of a multi-asset Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platform for operations with tokenized assets. It will only be taught in a synthetic environment and will not include real-world transactions.</p>

<p>Brazil has been actively cooperating with many firms—traditional and from the cryptocurrency industry—for several years, in addition to entering the race to establish a CBDC in September 2022. Binance and Mastercard, for example, began issuing the former&#8217;s crypto debit card in early 2023.</p>



<p>For years, South America has been open to digital assets such as central-bank digital currencies and other cryptocurrencies. Although El Salvador was the first government in the world to accept Bitcoin as legal cash, it is far from the sole example of a crypto-friendly posture.</p>



<p>Notwithstanding this broad tendency, there has lately been a change in attitudes in several sections of the continent. Argentina, a South American nation, has lately begun to strike back against cryptocurrencies by prohibiting payment service providers from enabling digital asset transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<li><em>The acquisition makes USBTC one of the largest miners in the United States by increasing computing power to 12.2 exahash/s (EH/s).</em></li>



<li><em>Miners can receive up to $75 million in management fees for Celsius mining rigs within 5 years.</em></li>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/188436-us-bitcoin-corp-secures-hosting-contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USBTC</a> won a bankruptcy auction for Celsius assets, including a loan portfolio, crypto assets, and 121,800 mining machines. Once it brings all the mining rigs online, its fleet will total at least 270,000 mining rigs.</p>



<p>The acquisition agreement made this miner one of the largest miners in the United States by increasing computing power to 12.2 exahash/s (EH/s), on par with those of mining giants like Riot Platforms (RIOT), Core Scientific (CORZ), and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA).</p>



<p>USBTC has submitted the winning bid as part of the Fahrenheit, LLC (&#8220;Fahrenheit&#8221;) consortium. Following the restructuring, Fahrenheit will act as the management company of the broader Celsius organization. Fahrenheit will receive a $20 million annual management fee for a five-year agreement with Celsius.
