If you&#8217;re not, you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on,” he stressed, adding that there will be trouble in all markets.</strong></p>
<h2>Jim Rogers on US Debt Crisis, Worst Bear Market, and the US Dollar Losing Dominance</h2>
<p>Veteran investor Jim Rogers reiterated his warnings about the biggest market downturn and the U.S. dollar losing its global reserve currency status during an <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-rogers-stock-market-outlook-crash-dollar-crypto-bitcoin-debt-2023-5">interview</a> with Real Vision last week. Rogers is George Soros’ former business partner who co-founded the Quantum Fund and Soros Fund Management. He cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The next bear market will be the worst in my lifetime, because the debt has gone up by such staggering amounts in the past 14 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rogers reiterated his previous <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-of-the-worst-recession-in-his-lifetime/">explanation</a> that the U.S. experienced a bear market in 2008 due to excessive debt. He pointed out that since 2009 the debt level worldwide has skyrocketed. &#8220;We should always be concerned about Washington. They don&#8217;t have a clue what they&#8217;re doing. And they prove it day in and day out,” he opined.</p>
<p>The renowned investor also believes that the U.S. dollar will lose its status as the world’s reserve currency. Discussing the global de-dollarization trend, he emphasized that numerous countries are actively seeking alternatives to the U.S. dollar, partly due to concerns over its substantial debt issue. Moreover, he mentioned that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-us-dollars-time-coming-to-an-end-as-countries-seek-alternatives/">weaponization</a> of the U.S. dollar creates an incentive for nations to reduce reliance on the USD. He warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>You should be extremely worried. If you&#8217;re not, you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rogers shared that he is “looking every day” for an alternative to the USD because he knows “something bad is going to happen in the currency markets in the next two or three years.” He recently said that the U.S. dollar&#8217;s time is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-us-dollars-time-coming-to-an-end-as-countries-seek-alternatives/">coming to an end</a> as countries seek alternatives to the USD.</p>

<p>The veteran investor also expects interest rates to increase worldwide. While admitting that he does not know how high central banks will increase interest rates to curb inflation this time, he stressed: “The world has never seen the debt and the spending and the money printing like in the last few years. So something is going to have to be very, very ruinous to solve this problem this time.&#8221; Rogers warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;ll be trouble in all the markets — property markets, stock markets, bond markets, currency markets, everything.</p></blockquote>

The two countries have ramped up their de-dollarization efforts with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi calling for the Central Bank of Iran to lay the necessary groundwork to ditch the U.S. dollar in bilateral trade settlements.<br />
</strong></p>
<h2>Iran and Russia Increase Cooperation Amid Heavy Sanctions</h2>
<p>The head of the Tehran-based Iran-Russia Joint Chamber of Commerce, Hadi Tizhoush Taban, discussed de-dollarization efforts by the two countries Friday in an interview with Iran&#8217;s news agency IRNA. He stated that the use of the Russian ruble and the Iranian rial in bilateral trade settlements between Russia and Iran has exceeded 60%.</p>
<p>The Joint Chamber chief explained that following the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Russia was heavily sanctioned by Western countries, just like Iran, so the two countries strengthened their cooperation. He added that during Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi&#8217;s recent visit to Russia, the two countries agreed to increase the value of their annual trade to $10 billion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tizhoush Taban detailed that the governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and the head of the Economic Commission of the Iranian Parliament recently visited Russia to strengthen economic, monetary, and banking ties between the two countries. During their visit, the CBI governor held meetings with Russia&#8217;s deputy prime minister, minister of economic development, and the head of the Russian central bank to discuss monetary and banking cooperation, solutions to remove some obstacles, and investment expansion. He emphasized that this process effectively circumvents Western sanctions, addresses issues related to mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation, and increases trade.</p>
<p>The head of the Joint Chamber also noted that Russia has become Iran&#8217;s largest foreign investor, with $2.7 billion in investments in two Iranian oil projects, adding that this investment accounts for about 45% of the total foreign investment in Iran from October 2021 to January 2023.</p>

<p>This week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-actively-shifting-to-settlements-in-national-currencies-us-dollar-share-declining-says-foreign-minister/">actively shifting</a> away from using the U.S. dollar in favor of national currencies. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said last month that the call to use national currencies in trade settlements has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-and-iran-phasing-out-us-dollar-in-bilateral-trade-settlements/">effective</a> as only a small amount of bilateral transactions still rely on the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Iranian President Raisi has called on the Central Bank of Iran to lay the necessary groundwork to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/president-raisi-calls-central-bank-of-iran-to-ditch-u-s-dollar-shift-to-national-currencies/">ditch the U.S. dollar</a> in bilateral trade settlements and use the Iranian rial whenever possible. In April, the secretary of the National Security Council of Iran <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-top-security-official-believes-recent-de-dollarization-efforts-will-doom-illegal-western-sanctions-to-failure/">stated</a> that the recent progress made in bilateral monetary and banking cooperation between Iran and Russia is essential for “dooming the illegal Western sanctions to failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iran is also seeking BRICS membership to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-seeks-brics-membership-to-counter-western-hegemony-promote-multipolar-world-says-president-raisi/">counter</a> Western hegemony and promote a multipolar world. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have been encouraging the use of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-to-encourage-use-of-local-currencies-in-trade/">national currencies</a> to settle trades in place of the U.S. dollar. There is also a proposal for a common BRICS currency that is expected to be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discussed</a> at the economic bloc&#8217;s upcoming leaders&#8217; summit.</p>

As per the CME Fedwatch tool, there is a 74% likelihood that the Fed will not raise the rate at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on June 14.</strong></p>
<h2>Larry Summers Stresses Need for Vigilance, Suggests Half-Point Rate Hike in July if Fed Skips at June FOMC Meeting</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-treasury-secretary-larry-summers-compares-ftx-collapse-to-enron-fraud/">Larry Summers</a> has voiced numerous concerns about the present condition of the U.S. economy. During an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/summers-says-fed-should-mull-half-point-july-hike-if-june-a-skip">appearance</a> on Bloomberg Television this week, he expressed uncertainty due to persisting risks. “We are again in a situation where the risks of overheating the economy are the primary risks that the Fed needs to be mindful of,” Summers informed Bloomberg TV host David Westin on Friday.</p>
<p>The general consensus is that no change in the federal funds rate will be established during the upcoming FOMC meeting. According to the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">CME Fedwatch tool</a>, there is a 74.7% probability that no alteration to the rate will occur on June 14, while only 25.3% of the market <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/market-outlook-cme-fedwatch-tool-points-to-increased-chance-of-june-rate-hike/">anticipates</a> a possible rate hike. If no increase materializes this month, as per market expectations, Summers suggests the Fed may need to compensate for this pause.</p>
<p>“If they don’t raise rates in June, I think they have to be open to the possibility that they may have to raise rates by 50 basis points in July if the economy continues to stay way hot and if inflation figures are robust,” Summers expounded.</p>

<p>Summers has criticized the Federal Reserve frequently; in 2021, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-defends-trillion-dollar-stimulus-while-jamie-dimon-and-larry-summers-warn-of-runaway-inflation/">raised alarms</a> about uncontrolled inflation. Addressing Aspen Security Forum last year, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/krugman-says-he-was-wrong-about-inflation-summers-talks-recession-biden-criticized-over-half-truths-and-fibs/">noted</a> there was more than a 50% chance that an economic slump could start in 2023. However, during his conversation with Westin, he theorized a potential recession could be postponed until 2024 by stating: &#8220;I think the Fed will end up doing enough to restrain inflation, that&#8217;s going to mean a quite soft economy sometime in 2024.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former Treasury authority added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve still got a tight, hot labor market.</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 2, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm">announced</a> a significant increase of 339,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs in the previous month, exceeding forecasts of a mere 190,000 job growth for May. Despite this rise, many industry experts question the legitimacy of the BLS data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember all of those articles about strong jobs and wages are why the Fed has been raising rates?&#8221; Wall Street Silver&#8217;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1664267119301738497?s=20">inquired</a>. &#8220;It was all fake. The BLS revisions show a MASSIVE decline in the data since Q4 2022. All of the data has been faked,&#8221; it concluded.</p>

Statistics show that BRC20s have increased in value significantly over the past 39 days, rising 1,511% from a total value of $29.48 million to today&#x2019;s market capitalization of $475 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Value of BRC20 Token Economy Holds Above $400 Million Since First Week of May</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#x2019;s BRC20 token economy remains just below the half-billion-dollar mark in value, with 24,677 listed BRC20 tokens, <a href="https://archive.ph/mwZya#selection-181.1-181.8">according</a> to the BRC20 market aggregation website brc-20.io. Similar to <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin&#x2019;s (BTC)</a> price during the past week, the market capitalization of the BRC20 economy has experienced limited movement and has been lackluster in terms of activity.</p>
<p>However, the BRC20 token economy has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brc20-token-economy-thrives-amidst-crypto-downturn-surging-53-in-five-days/">consistently</a> maintained a value above the $400 million range since the first week of May 2023. Approximately 39 days ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230425192408/https://brc-20.io/">statistics</a> from the same website saved by archive.org indicated that there were only 3,981 tokens on April 25.</p>

<p>The increase from 3,981 BRC20 tokens to the current 24,677 represents a 519% increase during that timeframe. At that time, the BRC20 token economy was valued at $29.48 million, and since then, it has risen 1,511% higher to reach the current value of $475 million.</p>

<p>Currently, the BRC20 token ordi holds the largest market valuation with its 21 million coins worth $11.36 per unit as of June 3. The ordi market, valued at $238 million, is followed by $B20, which commands a market capitalization of around $43 million on Saturday.</p>
<p>$B20&#x2019;s market valuation is followed by OXBT&#x2019;s capitalization, which is around $28 million. The fourth and fifth BRC20 token market caps are then rounded out by vmpx and $OG$ in terms of market valuation.</p>

<p>On June 3, metrics further show that there has been $207 million in BRC20 token trade volume worldwide. <a href="https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/brc20">Statistics</a> from Dune Analytics indicate that there have been 8,640,447 BRC20 token transfers to date.</p>

<p>On Friday, June 2, 2023, there were over 114,000 BRC20 transactions, marking a decline in the number of transfers per day since May 7, 2023, when there were more than 397,000 BRC20 transactions.</p>

Furthermore, sales figures for the trailing week demonstrate that the Bitcoin blockchain maintains its rank as second in weekly sales volume.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum Dominates NFT Market with 60% Share, Bitcoin NFT Sales Capture 17% of Weekly Sales Volume</h2>
<p>The NFT sales for this week saw a <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">39.35% growth</a> from last week, amounting to $202.22 million in global sales. The quantity of NFT buyers also expanded by 37.45%, reaching the current week&#x2019;s total of 724,193 buyers. Besides those two data points, NFT transactions have ascended to 2,350,977 transactions, marking a 6.94% increase compared to the preceding week. In the meantime, sales originating from the Ethereum blockchain led the $202 million in sales by collecting approximately $123.17 million.</p>

<p>The ETH-based NFT sales represented 60.97% of all NFT sales documented over the past week. Bitcoin NFT sales secured second place with $34.97 million in revenue during the previous seven days. These Bitcoin-based NFT sales constituted roughly 17.31% of the combined number of NFTs sold this past week. In terms of NFT sales distributed across 21 blockchains, Polygon, Solana, and Mythos followed Ethereum and Bitcoin in the top five.</p>

<p>The Ethereum-backed Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection claimed this week&#x2019;s top compilation status with $17.06 million in sales volume. The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> NFTs from the Azuki collection secured second place this week with $13.75 million in sales. Uncategorized Ordinals grabbed third place with $9.5 million worth of Bitcoin-focused NFTs sold, while Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) snagged fourth place with $8.50 million in sales this week. Bitcoin NFTs from the $OXBT BRC20 collection accumulated $8.32 million in sales, claiming the fifth spot this week.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">Data</a> from cryptoslam.io reveals that this week&#x2019;s most expensive NFT sale or the highest-priced NFT item was an Uncategorized Ordinal, which fetched $2.72 million. A single NFT from the $PPAI BRC20 NFT collection sold for $1.34 million, while the third priciest item was another Uncategorized Ordinal that commanded $709,371.</p>

<p>All five of the costliest NFTs sold during the past week originated from the Bitcoin blockchain. The sixth most expensive NFT&#x2014;generated from the Azuki NFT collection&#x2014;sold for $306,976 on the Blur marketplace just nine hours ago.</p>

As a result, controls to several blockchain network routers have been impaired. The project&#8217;s native token, MULTI, has experienced a 1% decline in the last 24 hours and a decrease of over 50% in the past two weeks.</strong></p>
<h2>Multichain Protocol Struggles as CEO Disappears</h2>
<p>This week, the cryptocurrency community has been <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Multichain&amp;src=typed_query">discussing</a> the <a href="https://multichain.org">Multichain Cross-Chain Router Protocol</a> after the team revealed its founder has gone missing. Multichain&#8217;s bridge technology allows users to transfer assets between different blockchain networks. As of the time of writing, the decentralized finance (defi) platform <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/multichain">holds</a> $1.45 billion in value.</p>
<p>“In the past two days, the Multichain protocol has experienced multiple issues due to unforeseeable circumstances,” the team <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1663941611380965376?s=20">disclosed</a> on Wednesday. “The team has done everything possible to maintain the protocol running, but we are currently unable to contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance.”</p>
<p>Multichain has revealed that its router technology experienced issues, leading to disruptions in the regular cross-chain service of select chains. According to the tweet from Multichain, the absence of Zhaojun has resulted in a lack of specific controls, making it challenging to address the problem adequately. The team further specified that Kekchain, Publicmint, Dyno Chain, Red Light Chain, Dexit, Ekta, HPB, ONUS, Omax, Findora, and Planq were among the affected chains.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiIgnas/status/1661720127447105537?s=20">rumors</a> that founding Multichain team members may have been <a href="https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/1661534385605074944?s=20">arrested</a> in China. Moreover, people have been discussing how the issue may be a problem for a large fraction of value locked in Multichain from much larger blockchain protocols like the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and Polygon. The blockchain Fantom holds the <a href="https://twitter.com/apes_prologue/status/1661489464798072832?s=20">largest exposure</a> to Multichain, followed by BSC, Optimism, and Kava.</p>

<p>The Fantom Foundation has <a href="https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1664314249391349760?s=20">emphasized</a> that the absence of Multichain&#8217;s CEOs has “no impact on Fantom&#8217;s assets and bridging.” Despite Multichain&#8217;s initial tweet, there have been no subsequent updates regarding Zhaojun&#8217;s whereabouts. Following this incident, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/multichain">MULTI</a>, the project&#8217;s native token, has witnessed a significant drop in value and experienced a decrease of over 50% over the course of the past two weeks.</p>

In a tweet, Sun said, &#x201C;TRON has now expanded its reach by going live on the Ethereum blockchain by leveraging the BitTorrent bridge.&#x201D; </strong></p>
<h2>Tron (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>)</h2>
<p>Tron (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>) was one the biggest movers on Saturday, with prices rising by as much as 11% in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.0762 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" target="_blank">TRX</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.08545 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of the surge, the token, which recently registered a record number of daily transactions, hit its highest point since June 2 last year.</p>

<p>Overall, tron is up 12.16% in the last seven days, with the latest rally leading to a breakout of a ceiling at $0.0796</p>
<p>The relative strength index (RSI) also moved above a resistance level of its own at 70.00, and is now tracking at 75.77.</p>
<p>Should this uptrend continue, there is a good chance that bulls will attempt to take the index to a higher ceiling at 79.00.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, hit a multi-week high to start the weekend, colliding with a key price ceiling in the process.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD surged to a high of $0.5299 earlier on Saturday, which comes following yesterday&#x2019;s low of $0.5137.</p>
<p>This move led to the token nearing a collision with a resistance level at $0.5300, securing its highest point since April 19 in the process.</p>

<p>Following this, prices have since slipped, with earlier bulls seemingly opting to secure gains.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is trading at $0.5234, and this comes as the RSI falls below its own ceiling at 69.00.</p>
<p>Price strength is now at 67.71, with the next visible floor at the 64.00 mark.</p>

<h2>&#x2018;Dad Almost Certainly Hacked,&#x2019; Son Tweets After Peter Schiff Launches $GOLD Token on Twitter</h2>
<p>Hackers obviously took control of economist Peter Schiff&#x2019;s Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account</a> to promote the supposed launch of a &#x201C;groundbreaking cryptocurrency token&#x201D; called $GOLD. A series of tweets posted in the space of a few hours suggested that the digital asset represents tokenized gold and is &#x201C;a complete and utter gamechanger for gold-backed DeFi&#x201D; that will &#x201C;empower the #Web3 community.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Claim your $GOLD,&#x201D; as it is &#x201C;extremely close to selling out,&#x201D; the perpetrators of the apparent scam urged followers of Schiff, who is a well-known gold proponent but also a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>). The posts, which led to the gold.fo domain as seen on the screenshot below, were later deleted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-591593 size-full" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/peter-schiff-screenshot-222.jpg" alt="Peter Schiff Twitter Apparently Hacked, Shills Gold Crypto, Son Spencer Warns" width="654" height="345" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/peter-schiff-screenshot-222-300x158.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/peter-schiff-screenshot-222.jpg 654w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"></p>
<p>&#x201C;Do not click this link,&#x201D; Schiff&#x2019;s son Spencer tweeted after seeing the suspicious activity of his father&#x2019;s account. He also informed the public that Peter is in the U.K. and is not responding to his messages in the early hours on Saturday, local time, concluding that his account was &#x201C;certainly hacked.&#x201D;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">DO NOT CLICK THIS LINK. My dad is in London and it&#x2019;s 4 AM over there which means he was almost certainly hacked. He&#x2019;s not responding to any of my texts. <a href="https://t.co/sHvQccCtLp">https://t.co/sHvQccCtLp</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Spencer Schiff (@SpencerKSchiff) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1664829999050891271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#x201C;It is truly amazing to see how empowering the crypto community is on twitter &#x2026; We are building crypto step-by-step,&#x201D; the scammers controlling @PeterSchiff wrote in one of the tweets &#x2014; words that Schiff would hardly type himself.</p>

<p>Peter Schiff has been a long-time crypto skeptic, regarding Bitcoin in particular which he has described as a tulip mania bubble and a Ponzi scheme, an asset with no intrinsic value. At the same time, the American stock broker has been an ardent advocate of gold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the financial commentator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-surprises-critics-dives-into-bitcoin-backed-nft-market/">announced</a> last week his participation in an art sale featuring non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>) minted on the Bitcoin blockchain. The surprising move sparked speculations that he might have changed his mind about crypto.</p>
<p>However, Schiff took to Twitter to point out that the collection, to be auctioned in June, is a &#x201C;tribute to gold&#x201D; and that he is &#x201C;still not a member of that club.&#x201D; Unlike his father, Spencer Schiff is a supporter of cryptocurrencies who describes himself as a Bitcoiner.</p>

Despite payrolls coming in better than expected, the unemployment rate also rose, hitting 3.7%, which is its highest point since last October.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was mostly consolidating to start the weekend, as traders continued to digest the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls data.</p>
<p>Payrolls rose to 339,000 last month, which was higher than the 190,000 markets were expecting.</p>
<p>Following a low of $26,898.00 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD is trading at $27,149.78 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>For many, a recent upward crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages was a signal that bullish momentum was set to return.</p>
<p>However, yesterday&#x2019;s economic data has added more questions than provided answers, as to what the Federal Reserve could do in its upcoming meeting.</p>
<p>A ceiling at $27,300 remains a key hurdle for bulls to overcome, and should this occur, the chances of a move to $28,000 will increase.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) briefly broke out of the $1,900 level to start the weekend. However, it has since rebounded.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD bounced to a peak of $1,910.28 on Saturday, after an earlier move which saw it land at a bottom at $1,878.61.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,903.70, with prices 0.63% higher than the aforementioned low.</p>

<p>In order to increase this percentage, the relative strength index (RSI) will need to rise above a ceiling at 49.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking at 48.08, with bears attempting to take it towards a support point at 47.00.</p>
<p>Should bulls reject this, the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> 10-day (red) moving average will likely extend its own crossover, which could help spur another uptrend.</p>

<h2>360 Mining and Cathedra Bitcoin Announce Texas Bitcoin Mining Venture</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://cathedra.com">Cathedra Bitcoin</a> (CBIT), the firm will be <a href="https://cathedra.com/news/news/cathedra-bitcoin-announces-off-grid-bitcoin-mining-partnership-with-360-mining">deploying</a> bitcoin miners at <a href="https://www.360mining.com">360 Mining&#x2019;s</a> off-grid Texas campus. CBIT will pay $55.00 per megawatt hour for power consumed, plus 10% of gross bitcoin mined at the site, the announcement details. The deal gives CBIT the rights to two megawatts of mining capacity which could produce an estimated 0.054 exahash per second (EH/s) or 54 petahash per second (PH/s) of capacity.</p>
<p>If necessary and its &#x201C;economically advantageous to do so,&#x201D; the company can abstain from bitcoin mining and sell the natural gas on the open market. &#x201C;We are excited to begin working with 360 Mining, a company run by bitcoiners who have put in the proof-of-work to develop off-grid mining expertise,&#x201D; Cathedra&#x2019;s chairman and president, Drew Armstrong stated. &#x201C;This partnership is an important step for Cathedra.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Armstrong added:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the onset of the bitcoin bear market last year, we were forced to pause our Rover manufacturing efforts and pursuit of off-grid energy to focus on maximizing near-term operating cash flow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cathedra plans to deploy its own mobile bitcoin mining data centers, called &#x201C;Rovers,&#x201D; to start with. These Rovers will be equipped with older models of mining machines, specifically the Whatsminer M31S and M32S, which Cathedra obtained through its partnership with Great American Mining in 2021-2022. The firm aims to optimize these machines using its underclocking technology, with the goal to make them more energy-efficient.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Upon completion of any subsequent deployments, the Company expects the full 2.0 megawatts of bitcoin mining capacity under the partnership to produce at least 54 PH/s of incremental hash rate,&#x201D; Cathedra&#x2019;s announcement details. Cathedra&#x2019;s collaboration with 360 Mining comes in the wake of numerous bitcoin mining companies <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stronghold-digital-partners-with-canaan-subsidiary-to-boost-bitcoin-mining-capacity-by-400-ph-s/">expanding</a> their operations and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-bolsters-hashrate-with-40-5m-purchase-of-12500-bitcoin-miners/">acquiring thousands</a> of ASIC machines for their fleets. Despite the challenges faced by bitcoin miners during the crypto bear market of 2022, 2023 has brought significant improvements for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining participants.</p>
