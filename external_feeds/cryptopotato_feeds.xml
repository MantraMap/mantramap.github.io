			            <description><![CDATA[Blockchain security firm Dedaub maintained that the total realized gain for the exploiter equaled around $5.5 million.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) platform &#8211; Poly Network &#8211; announced on Twitter that it had halted operations due to a &#8220;recent attack.&#8221; The team revealed that the exploit affected 57 cryptocurrencies on 10 blockchains, advising users to &#8220;promptly withdraw liquidity from decentralized exchanges.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poly Network experienced another similar hack in 2021 when wrongdoers drained around $600 million worth of digital assets.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Trying to Solve the Problem</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poly Network <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675591279005106178" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a> it had requested the assistance of &#8220;cybersecurity professionals and individuals with relevant knowledge&#8221; and urged users with any information to share it with the team. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 57 affected cryptocurrencies include Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dai (DAI), and many more. Despite not disclosing the exact scope of the exploit, some presumed the sum could be substantial. Blockchain security firm Dedaub </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/dedaub/status/1675516729349292032" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">claimed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> hackers compromised the addresses&#8217; private keys. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At one point, there were reports that the hack was worth $34 billion. </span>In reality, though, the attacker managed to mint this amount, almost all of it was on the Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain Metis, but they weren&#8217;t able to withdraw it due to a lack of liquidity.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dedaub added that the breach &#8220;wasn&#8217;t complex&#8221; and that the attacker used keys to sign proof that they were owed Binance Coin (BNB). The total realized gain for the wrongdoer was approximately $5.5 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poly Network said it will try to join forces with centralized exchanges and law enforcement agencies on the case. It raised hopes that the attacker will return the stolen assets to avoid potential legal troubles. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To minimize additional risks for customers, the DeFi platform urged those holding the affected assets &#8220;to expedite the process of withdrawing liquidity and unlocking their LP tokens.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Please remain calm and trust that we are committed to safeguarding your assets,&#8221; the team concluded.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CZ Chips in</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The CEO of Binance &#8211; Changpeng Zhao (CZ) &#8211; was among the people to react to the latest attack in the DeFi space. He </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1675380954674651137" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">shared</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> figures from Lookonchain, according to which the Poly Network hackers have sold 94B SHIB for 360 ETH, 495M COOK for 16 ETH, and 15M RFuel for 27 ETH.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He assured that the incident will not reflect on Binance users since the platform does not support deposits from the compromised protocol. The exec also said the exchange has already provided Poly Network assistance in fixing the problem. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Previous Major Hack</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poly Network has a bad record with similar hacks, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-600m-polynetwork-hack-what-exactly-happened-and-what-investors-should-be-aware-of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">becoming</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a victim of a $600 million exploit in 2021 (one of the biggest in the history of DeFi). Specifically, the wrongdoers siphoned $266.6 million worth of digital currencies from the Ethereum network, $252 million from Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and $85 million from Polygon.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a sudden twist of events, though, the attackers </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/poly-network-hacker-returns-260-million-after-record-crypto-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">returned</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> some of the drained assets, starting with a $260 million tranche. Some crypto tracking firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic claimed the person/or people behind the attack did it &#8220;for fun&#8221; and wanted to &#8220;expose the vulnerability&#8221; of the network before others find its cracks. In the aftermath, the hackers </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/poly-network-drama-is-over-hacker-returns-the-remaining-141-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">returned</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the full amount a few weeks later.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Selected projects will receive funding from WMG and Polygon Labs among other perks. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American entertainment juggernaut Warner Music Group and Polygon Labs have deepened their alliance with the launch of a new music accelerator program that aims to drive &#8220;the next generation of innovation at the intersection of Web3 and music.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the program, the two companies plan on backing developers releasing music-related projects and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Polygon network.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/warner_polygon_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257671" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/warner_polygon_cover.jpg" alt="warner_polygon_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/warner_polygon_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/warner_polygon_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/warner_polygon_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/warner_polygon_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/warner_polygon_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Warner Music Group x Polygon Labs</h2>
<p>According to the official <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1674060054985621504" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">announcement</a>, applications for the program will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and selected projects will receive several benefits. This includes joint funding from WMG and Polygon Labs as well as partnership assistance throughout the growing Polygon developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, the two platforms will also offer quarterly check-ins to the selected projects as well as strategic advising, networking and connection creation, and marketing and promotion.</p>
<p>Warner and Polygon would ideally lean towards applicants for the initiative at the intersection of music, technology, and Web3 that focus on key areas such as advancing artist-fan communities, establishing decentralized music production and distribution systems, innovating ticketing solutions, exploring music-related merchandise and digital/physical collectibles and integrating music with interactive technology and gaming.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Polygon Labs and WMG are partnering to help support, advance and scale the next generation of standout music x Web3 projects. If you’re music obsessed and passionate about how Web3 can unlock value for creators, fans and music artists–this program is for you!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>WMG&#8217;s Chief Digital Officer Oana Ruxandra said that the record label conglomerate seeks to enable its artists and songwriters to &#8220;build, activate, engage, and monetize their communities in this next era of music creation and consumption&#8221; with the new accelerator program.</p>
<h2>Warner&#8217;s Previous Web3 Trysts</h2>
<p>The latest development isn&#8217;t the first time that Polygon and Warner Music Group have teamed up. In fact, the two companies joined forces with e-commerce platform LGND.io last December to <a href="https://www.wmg.com/news/lgnd-io-partners-with-warner-music-group-polygon-on-new-music-and-collectibles-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">launch</a> a multi-year web3 music program enabling users to play digital vinyl on the go.</p>
<p>The record label also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/warner-music-group-delves-deeper-into-metaverse-invests-in-dressx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">expanded</a> its metaverse strategy after recently partnering and investing in digital fashion retailer &#8211; DressX. WMG also dived into blockchain gaming after forging a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/global-music-mogul-warner-music-group-partners-with-splinterlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnership</a> with Splinterlands.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Nigerians and Argentines seem to be the most optimistic about crypto's future, compared to Japanese, Americans, and Brits, who predominantly disagree.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A joint research conducted by Consensys and YouGov estimated that 92% of the participants are aware of cryptocurrencies. 37% see the asset class as the future money, whereas 26% are on the opposite corner, viewing it as a scam.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Residents of the United States and the United Kingdom are more likely to associate digital currencies with fraudulent schemes.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Sentiment Toward Crypto and NFTs</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The survey, which spread across the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Africa and questioned over 15,000 individuals, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://consensys.io/blog/global-survey-on-crypto-and-web3-press-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">showed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that most respondents are aware of cryptocurrencies, with many seeing a bright future for the industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nearly 40% of the participants believe the asset class could emerge as the future of money, while 31% see it as the future of digital ownership. Every fourth gives the sector the evil eye, comparing it to a scam.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nigerians (65%) and Argentines (56%) are most motivated to hold digital assets as a means to store value. This could be explained by the instability of their financial system and local currencies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nigerians are also the most inclined to associate crypto with the future of money. South Africans and Mexicans are, respectively, second and third. On the other hand, only 15% of Brits and 17% of Germans agree with that thesis.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The survey touched upon the environmental impact which the technology has on the planet. 57% of Brazilians believe it is not harmful, whereas just 25% of the French respondents think the same.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, the analysis revealed that Nigeria, South Africa, and Vietnam are the countries most familiar with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 76% of the Brits who are aware of digital collectibles have never owned any, compared to 24% of Vietnamese.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Results reveal that people worldwide are motivated to build and believe they are making valuable contributions online. This evolution indicates a shift in user behavior toward active participation, empowerment, and broader community ownership, characterized by Web3,&#8221; Consensys and YouGov concluded.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Closer Look at Nigeria and Argentina</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The economic turbulence, most specifically the depreciation of their official currencies, could be a leading pro-crypto factor for Nigerians and Argentines. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <em>CryptoPotato </em></span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/nigerians-rush-to-buy-bitcoin-amid-economy-collapse-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> last summer, some residents of the African country started looking for alternative investments such as bitcoin and stablecoins amid a severe crash of the naira. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For their part, Argentines have opened their arms toward the asset class due to the nation&#8217;s political chaos and financial disturbance.

			            <description><![CDATA[22% of German cryptocurrency investors think digital currencies could help them get rich overnight.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a KuCoin research, 49% of German crypto investors believe digital currencies could help them achieve long-term wealth accumulation plans. Every fourth thinks the asset class could serve as a store of value amid the current economic turbulence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most German crypto investors fall in the Generation Y demographic group, also known as Millennials (those born between the 1980s and the late 1990s).</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Closer Look</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The survey </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.kucoin.com/blog/kucoin-s-into-the-cryptoverse-report-reveals-german-users-love-for-versatile-crypto-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that Millennials account for 51% of the total number of cryptocurrency investors in Germany, while Generation X (those in their 40s and 50s) is second with 30%. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Digital assets are usually an interesting matter for youngsters as they are more open-minded toward innovations. However, Generation Z (those aged 18-25) represents only 19% of all Germans with exposure to the crypto market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The biggest share of people hopped on the bandwagon less than three months ago, whereas 15% have done so in the past half a year. One possible reason behind that interest could be crypto&#8217;s revival since the start of 2023. Bitcoin, for example, finished 2022 at around $16,500, while currently, it is well above the $30,000 level. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Every fourth German crypto investor entered the ecosystem to diversify their portfolios. 30% find investing in digital assets &#8220;convenient,&#8221; whereas 22% want to get rich overnight. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The most popular use cases for crypto in Germany include trading, online shopping, purchasing non-fungible tokens (NFTs), HODLing/staking, accepting/paying salaries, and others.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin (BTC) is the primary crypto investment choice for locals, with 64% of the investors having exposure to it. 40% have bought Ethereum (ETH), while 26% have bought NFTs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">KuCoin believes the cryptocurrency landscape in Germany is &#8220;evolving.&#8221; It sees this as a &#8220;promising sign, considering the rapid pace at which the crypto market develops and adopts emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and more.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, the company argued that interest in Ethereum and other similar projects indicates the potential of an upcoming Web3 revolution in Europe&#8217;s strongest economy.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Germany&#8217;s Pro-Crypto Stance</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another survey carried out by Coincub </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/germany-is-the-most-crypto-friendly-nation-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the European country is the most crypto-friendly nation for Q1 2022. Germany&#8217;s acceptance of the asset class and its &#8220;groundbreaking decision&#8221; to allow investments helped for the top position, the entity outlined.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shortly after, the German authorities doubled down by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/germany-no-taxes-for-selling-btc-and-eth-if-held-for-over-a-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">making</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the sale of BTC and ETH tax-free if those assets were held for over 12 months. Prior to that, people had to keep such holdings for ten years to be exempt from taxation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike other European countries, Germany has imposed some regulations in the past few years. Legislation that was approved in 2020 requires all cryptocurrency exchanges operating inside the nation&#8217;s borders to secure a license from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Such entities must also hold a minimum amount of capital and comply with anti-money laundering policies. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Musbach avoided the maximum sentence of ten years.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">John Michael Musbach &#8211; a 34-year-old resident of Haddonfield, New Jersey &#8211; was reportedly sentenced to six and a half years in jail for hiring a hitman to commit a murder.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He transferred $20,000 worth of BTC to the &#8220;executor&#8221; to kill a kid that was about to testify against him in a child-pornography case. Moreover, the youngster was the victim. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Gruesome Crime That Led to the Punishment</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://patch.com/new-jersey/haddon/haddonfield-man-who-paid-hitman-kill-kid-sentenced-prison" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">coverage</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Musbach exchanged sexually explicit videos and photographs with a 13-year-old child in the summer of 2015. The victim&#8217;s parents learned about the offense and contacted law enforcement agents. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">New York&#8217;s police identified that Musbach was behind the crime. The authorities collaborated with the Atlantic County Prosecutor&#8217;s office, which arrested him in March 2016. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to the pornography charges, the investigators discovered that Musbach had even more horrid intentions. Upon searching his home, they detected he was looking for a hitman on the Dark Web that could kill the child so it won&#8217;t testify against him. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The man asked one potential &#8220;killer&#8221; whether murdering a 14-year-old would be an issue. He was assured that the target&#8217;s age was not a problem and paid approximately 40 BTC (equaling around $20,000 at the time).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Musbach pleaded guilty in 2017 to endangering the welfare of a child by sexual contact. He received a two-year suspended sentence with parole supervision for life. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After finding out about his murder plans, though, the Camden federal court changed the punishment to six and a half years. He faced a maximum sentence of ten years behind bars.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Surprisingly, not the First Case</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scott Quinn Berkett &#8211; a 26-year-old resident of Beverly Hills, Los Angeles &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/california-man-pays-a-hitman-13k-in-bitcoin-to-kill-his-ex-girlfriend-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">pleaded</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> guilty last summer to sending $13K in bitcoin to a hitman on the Dark Web whose task was to kill Berkett&#8217;s ex-girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Undercover agents discovered the crime and contacted the offender introducing themselves as the killer. Berkett confirmed his intentions and even sent additional money to the detectives. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prosecutors have initially aimed at a ten-year prison sentence. However, they later recommended a five-year one because Berkett&#8217;s &#8220;mental health condition is a mitigating factor.&#8221; Judge Scarsi followed that guidance and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://lawandcrime.com/crime/a-man-paid-bitcoin-to-a-scam-dark-web-murder-for-hire-service-to-kill-a-woman-who-rejected-his-advances-now-hes-going-to-federal-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">sent</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> him to prison for 60 months.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BlackRock’s filing renewed the hopes of several U.S. traditional finance firms. Here's the list of companies that have resubmitted their applications. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past two weeks, there has been a series of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications from different traditional finance giants in the United States.</p>
<p>The frenzy started after BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager with over $9 trillion in AUM, submitted its spot Bitcoin ETF filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 15.</p>
<h2>A Bitcoin Spot ETF Frenzy</h2>
<p>BlackRock’s move spurred several Bitcoin ETF hopefuls to make fresh applications despite repeated rejections from the SEC in the past. The development also triggered a BTC rally that caused the leading crypto asset to soar past $30,000 and chart a multi-month peak.</p>
<p>An ETF is an investment vehicle that tracks the value of an underlying asset. A Bitcoin ETF would expose investors to the cryptocurrency without the burden of physically buying and holding the digital asset. It also relieves them of the stress of understanding the complexities of crypto exchanges, private keys, and crypto wallets.</p>
<p>A spot Bitcoin ETF directly tracks the price of BTC, while a futures Bitcoin ETF would follow the price of the asset’s futures contracts.</p>
<p>The SEC has rejected dozens of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past, arguing that the proposals did not meet anti-fraud and investor protection standards. The regulator also mentioned the potential for market manipulation of the underlying crypto asset.</p>
<p>However, BlackRock’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-spot-etf-btc-dropped-to-3-month-low-as-fed-pauses-interest-rate-hikes-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">application</a> has renewed the hopes of several traditional firms in the U.S.</p>
<h2>U.S. Companies That Have Filed for Spot Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>Shortly after BlackRock’s ETF application, which mentioned Coinbase Custody as its crypto custodian and BNY Mellon as its cash custodian, New York-based asset manager WisdomTree <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/after-blackrock-two-more-asset-managers-file-to-launch-a-btc-etf-in-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal">resubmitted</a> its filing for approval on June 20. The SEC previously rejected WisdomTree’s spot filing twice, in 2021 and 2022; hence, this is the firm’s third attempt.</p>
<p>Investment management company Invesco also submitted its second spot Bitcoin ETF application on the same day as WisdomTree. The firm and Galaxy Digital initially filed a joint application in September 2021.</p>
<p>Shortly after, financial services firm Valkyrie rejoined the queue, filing for the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund on June 21. The company’s initial filing was rejected around Christmas 2021.</p>
<p>Up next was investment manager VanEck’s refiling on June 22 after two <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fidelity-refiles-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-after-blackrock/" data-wpel-link="internal">rejections</a> in 2021 and March 2023.</p>
<p>On June 29, Fidelity Digital Assets tried again with a spot Bitcoin ETF filing after modifications to make the document identical to BlackRock’s submission.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest and Swiss-based ETF provider 21Shares <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-028.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">submitted</a> their <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ark-21shares-bitcoin-etf-rejected-by-the-sec-once-again/" data-wpel-link="internal">third application</a> on April 25 to launch the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase now plays a key role in almost all Bitcoin Spot ETF filings. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several financial giants, including Fidelity, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, have changed their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in regard to their applications for Bitcoin Spot ETFs.</p>
<p>This comes just hours after the US securities regulator reportedly warned that all recent filings for such products were &#8220;inadequate.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li>BlackRock <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal">splashed the waters</a> two weeks ago when it filed with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund. While it was definitely not the first to try its luck, it was unquestionably the largest financial entity to do so.</li>
<li>The move was mimicked by several other notable players, including Fidelity, which copied BlackRock&#8217;s application, while Ark Invest changed its own to be the same as the world&#8217;s largest asset manager.</li>
<li>However, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumps-below-30k-as-sec-warns-that-recent-btc-spot-etf-filings-are-inadequate-wsj/" data-wpel-link="internal">cited</a> people familiar with the matter that said the SEC was not impressed by the recent filings as they were not “sufficiently clear and comprehensive.”</li>
<li>Aside from the negative effects on BTC&#8217;s price, the SEC&#8217;s warning resulted in immediate actions from the companies that have active applications for such a product.</li>
<li>As <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fidelity-leads-flurry-of-bitcoin-etf-refilings-to-answer-sec-1.1940300" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by Bloomberg, some of the names include Fidelity Investments, Invesco, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and VanEck.</li>
<li>All changes involve Coinbase, as the largest US exchange has now been named as custodian of the funds and will provide market surveillance. The SEC has previously rejected all Spot Bitcoin ETF applications alleging that they failed to provide clear information on how the products aim to protect investors from market manipulation.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that the Commission has its own legal issues with Coinbase, as it sued the latter for selling unregistered securities. The exchange denied the allegations and most recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-files-request-for-dismissal-of-charges/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> to have all charges dropped.</li>
</ul>

			            <description><![CDATA[Flow is today's top performer following a massive 20% surge that drove it to above $0.65.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has calmed after the Friday rollercoaster that drove it up and down by over a grand and remains relatively still at $30,500.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also less volatile today, as it typically happens during the weekends, with SOL emerging as the most substantial gainer from the larger caps.</p>
<h2>BTC Above $30K</h2>
<p>Bitcoin went on a tear last week when it jumped from $26,500 to over $31,000 to register a new multi-month high. The bears tried to intervene but only managed to halt BTC&#8217;s price surge, and the asset remained stuck in a range between $30,000 and $31,000 for the past seven days or so.</p>
<p>That all changed on Friday following <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumps-below-30k-as-sec-warns-that-recent-btc-spot-etf-filings-are-inadequate-wsj/" data-wpel-link="internal">reports</a> that the SEC could reject the most recent Bitcoin Spot ETF applications filed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and others as they supposedly lacked critical information.</p>
<p>BTC reacted with an immediate nosedive that took it from over $31,000 to a 10-day low of $29,500 (on Bitstamp). However, the bulls stepped up and pushed the cryptocurrency north shortly after, resulting in a recovery to $30,500 on Saturday.</p>
<p>The past 24 hours have been quite calm, with the asset remaining at around that time. As such, its market cap is still just under $600 billion, and its dominance over the altcoins is shy of 50%.</p>

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>SOL Eyes $20</h2>
<p>The altcoins also experienced impressive price increases over the past few weeks, with some standing out the most. Such was the case with Bitcoin Cash which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-cash-explodes-33-to-14-month-high-solana-and-litecoin-soar-15-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">exploded</a> by over 100% weekly at one point and registered a 14-month high above $320 earlier this week.</p>
<p>The case with LTC was similar yesterday as it also had a new <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoin-ltc-soars-to-14-month-high-above-100-bitcoin-btc-reclaims-30k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">14-month peak</a> at over $110. However, the landscape is less volatile now, with LTC, DOGE, ETH, TRX, DOT, BCH, and SHIB charting insignificant losses.</p>
<p>In contrast, XRP is up by almost 3% but still stands under $0.5, and SOL jumped by roughly 5% to over $19.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has added less than $10 billion in a day but has managed to tap $1.2 trillion on CMC.</p>

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Since Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the G7 sanctions response, wholesale CBDC developments have doubled,&#8221; the company behind the study claimed.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other leading economies like Japan and the United Kingdom are developing prototypes and are considering consulting the public on the eventual release of a CBDC.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The European Central Bank has also displayed intentions to introduce a digital euro.

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Pros and Cons of CBDCs</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There are different reasons why a central bank would seek the launch of such a product. Atlantic Council believes CBDCs could promote financial inclusion by providing money access to the unbanked population, introducing competition in the local monetary markets, increasing the efficiency of settlements, and lower transaction fees. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, CBDCs are much different than cryptocurrencies. The latter are famous for their decentralized nature.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDCs will be issued and controlled by central banks, meaning they could work against people&#8217;s privacy. Numerous individuals have warned about the release of those products.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new survey by Binance Research, the research arm of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, found that most institutional investors are optimistic about the outlook of cryptocurrencies for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Binance Research conducted the survey from March 31 to May 15, 2023, with 208 global institutional clients and VIP users as the respondents. The study, dubbed the &#8220;<a href="https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/institutional-crypto-outlook-survey-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Institutional Crypto Outlook Survey</a>,&#8221; explored the respondents&#8217; attitudes, preferences, motivations, and adoption toward crypto investments.</p>
<h2>A Positive Crypto Outlook</h2>
<p>The respondents comprised a diverse mix of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutional-investors-are-still-buying-crypto-according-to-a-coinbase-survey/" data-wpel-link="internal">institutional investors</a> with various levels of experience and assets under management (AUM). More than 48% of the participants have over five years of crypto investing experience. Funds with crypto AUM below $25 million made up 52.4% of the surveyees, while those with AUM above $100 million accounted for 22.6%.</p>
<p>In the outlook category, 63.5% of the respondents expressed optimism for the crypto sector over the next 12 months. And when the time frame was extended to a decade, 88% of the surveyees indicated a positive outlook for crypto.</p>
<p>Regarding allocation, 47.1% of the participants disclosed that they maintained their crypto holdings over the past year, while 35.6% increased theirs within the same period. About half of the respondents expect to increase their crypto possessions with time, while 4.3% would do the opposite in the next year.</p>
<p>Investors&#8217; interests were focused on layer-1 and layer-2 sectors and infrastructure. Roughly 54% of participants found infrastructure most important to them or their fund, followed by layer-1 and layer-2 sectors at 48.1% and 43.8%. Decentralized applications (dApps) were discovered to be the most used in recent months.</p>
<h2>Driving Crypto Adoption</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the respondents expressed their belief in more real-world use cases and improvements in regulatory clarity fueling the drive for crypto adoption. Approximately 27% demanded more real-world use cases, while 25.3% asked for regulatory clarity.</p>
<p>The need for increased institutional participation through banks and other financial institutions also emerged as another driver of crypto <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutional-adoption-of-defi-is-many-years-away-says-blackrock-executive/" data-wpel-link="internal">adoption</a>, followed by stronger security like fraud detection and custody solutions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The results highlight institutional investors&#8217; belief in broad ecosystem developments rather than short-term price action in driving widespread crypto adoption,&#8221; the report stated.</p></blockquote>
