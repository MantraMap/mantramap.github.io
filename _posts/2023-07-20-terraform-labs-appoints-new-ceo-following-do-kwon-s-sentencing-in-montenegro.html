Previously, Amani held leadership positions at prominent technology companies such as MongoDB, Electronic Arts, and Zynga.

We look forward to sharing more on this soon&#8221;  The plan involves reducing node syncing times, creating a TerraUSD testnet, developing yield-generating applications, and implementing a reward system for developers.
