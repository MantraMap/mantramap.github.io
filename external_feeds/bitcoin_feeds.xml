<h2>US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Urges Congress to Act Quickly to Avoid Debt Default</h2>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has urged Congress to act quickly on the issue of raising the debt ceiling to avoid a possible debt default that would bring negative consequences for the economy of the country. In a press conference in Niigata, Japan, ahead of the G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, Yellen warned again about the terrible effects that such an event would cause.</p>
<p>Yellen <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/11/yellen-g7-debt-ceiling-unthinkable.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no good alternative that will save us from catastrophe. I don’t want to get into ranking which bad alternative is better than others, but the only reasonable thing is to raise the debt ceiling and to avoid the dreadful consequences that will come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Yellen stated that, for her, this would be a self-inflicted crisis that has no reason to be happening. She explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no good reason to generate a good crisis of our own making. The U.S. Congress has raised or suspended the debt limit almost 80 times since 1960. I urge it to act quickly to do so once again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Defaulting Would Be &#8216;Unthinkable&#8217;</h2>
<p>Yellen had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> before about the catastrophe that the U.S. defaulting on its debt would mean for the economic system of the country and markets worldwide. Yellen also referred to this issue this time, stating that the consequences would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>She explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The notion of defaulting on our debt is something that would so badly undermine the U.S. and global economy that I think it should be regarded by everyone as unthinkable. America should never default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bipartisan negotiations on the debt limit issue have not been successful, as the Republican party demands a series of cost cuts that would affect spending in some key areas for the Democrat side, including healthcare and other social benefits. Negotiations are slated to restart this Friday, and Yellen is &#8220;very hopeful&#8221; that the two parties will be able to bridge their differences to raise the debt limit.</p>

The high-tech data centers will rely on a full immersion solution to cool the power-hungry miners as the desert climate renders air-cooled mining infeasible, participants said.</strong></p>
<h2>Advanced Crypto Mining Facilities in Abu Dhabi to Defy Cooling Challenges in Arab Peninsula</h2>
<p>Marathon Digital Holdings, a leading U.S.-based crypto mining company, and emerging blockchain infrastructure developer Zero Two, are working to launch what they say will be the Middle East’s first immersion bitcoin mining operations.</p>
<p>The partners have formed a joint venture, Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), to develop and run two new sites for digital asset mining with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts (MW), Marathon announced in a press release providing information about the project.</p>
<p>The larger, 200 MW facility will be constructed in Masdar City, the sustainability hub of Abu Dhabi, the capital city of UAE. The other, 50MW crypto farm will be located in the port zone of Mina Zayed, the announcement detailed.</p>
<p>The sites will be powered with excess energy, thus increasing the base load and sustainability of Abu Dhabi’s power grid. The two companies emphasized their intention is to also offset any non-sustainably produced electricity used with clean energy certificates.</p>
<p>Construction of the crypto mining farms is already underway and the mining equipment has been ordered. Both sites, which will have a combined hashrate of approximately 7 EH/s, are expected to come online as early as this year.</p>
<p>Before starting the realization of the project, Marathon Digital and Zero Two launched a pilot program to establish the efficacy of a large crypto mining operation in Abu Dhabi, where the hot desert climate renders air-cooled mining infeasible.</p>
<p>The initial results of the pilot indicate that operating mining sites in the UAE is now feasible thanks to an immersion solution to cool the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASIC</a> miners, custom-built by the two companies, and implementing proprietary software to optimize their performance.</p>
<p>The equity ownership in the ADGM joint venture will be 80% for Zero Two and 20% for Marathon, with capital contributions in 2023 expected to total around $406 million. The details about the mining project come after analysts recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-may-take-up-18-of-bitcoin-hashrate-in-next-big-migration-of-crypto-miners-experts-say/">predicted</a> that increased regulatory pressures, energy costs, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-pushes-dame-tax-proposal-to-address-alleged-environmental-costs-of-crypto-mining/">taxes</a> in current mining hotspots may result in a new migration of crypto miners to more favorable jurisdictions.</p>

<h2>SEC Chair Gary Gensler on U.S. Debt Default</h2>
<p>The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has weighed in on the impact a U.S. default would have on capital markets as discussions of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations heat up in Congress.</p>
<p>“I’d like to say a few words regarding the ongoing discussions in Washington around the debt ceiling,” the SEC chairman said in his remarks before the International Swaps and Derivatives Association annual meeting Wednesday. Gensler cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the U.S. Treasury as an issuer were actually to default, it would have very significant, hard to predict, and likely lasting effects on investors, issuers, and markets alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>“In a word, it would make the Cyclone Roller Coaster at the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair look like a kiddie ride,” he stressed.</p>
<p>The SEC chairman also clarified: “While we at the SEC have no direct role in those discussions, the outcome is directly consequential to each part of our mission: protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets.”</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve already seen an effect in the pricing and liquidity of short-dated Treasury bills and continue to monitor for any additional tremors.</p></blockquote>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen revealed last week that the Treasury Department may not be able to pay all of the government’s bills <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">as early as June 1</a> &#8220;if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.” She also warned of &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; consequences of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations.</p>

<h2>Goldman Sachs Agrees With Treasury Secretary Yellen on US Default Risks</h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs executive Beth Hammack warned about the risks of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations in an interview on Bloomberg Television Tuesday. Hammack is co-head of Goldman Sachs&#8217; Global Financing Group within the Investment Banking Division (IBD) and a member of the firm&#8217;s Management Committee. She also serves as the chair of the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Borrowing Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Regarding a possible U.S. debt default, she said: &#8220;This is a conundrum for all international investors. They don&#8217;t understand why we&#8217;ve made these appropriations and we&#8217;re not willing to pay the bills that we already agreed we would pay. And so I think that&#8217;s really confusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs executive warned, “I think there is real risk to the U.S. dollar as we leave this in a more protracted state of negotiations,” emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anything that moves us away from being viewed as the world’s reserve currency, of being the safest most liquid asset in the world, is bad for the American people, bad for the dollar, and bad for the U.S. government.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chair of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee proceeded to explain that the dislocations being created in the U.S. Treasury bill markets are “inefficient” and they “create extra cost for the taxpayers.”</p>
<p>The Treasury bill markets began factoring in the risks of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations from next month onward after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">warned</a> that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government’s bill in early June.</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs executive said she agreed with Treasury Secretary Yellen that the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations would have “catastrophic consequences for the U.S. economy.” Moreover, she cautioned that there would be “a huge ripple effect” if the Treasury stops making some payments.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Yellen said at a press conference ahead of a G7 meeting in Japan that a default would &#8220;risk undermining U.S. global economic leadership and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lawmaker said this week that a default poses <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lawmaker-warns-us-default-risks-dollars-reserve-currency-status-exploitation-by-china-and-russia/">risks</a> to the U.S. dollar&#8217;s reserve currency status. Federal Reserve Chairman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-warns-of-uncertain-and-adverse-consequences-of-us-debt-default-wed-be-in-uncharted-territory/">Jerome Powell</a> has also warned of &#8220;uncertain and adverse consequences&#8221; from the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations.</p>

Trump, who is also running for president in 2024, stressed that letting the U.S. default is “better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors.”</strong></p>
<h2>Donald Trump&#8217;s Advice on U.S. Default</h2>
<p>Former President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has advised Republican lawmakers to let the United States default on its debt obligations if Democrats do not agree to spending cuts.</p>
<p>Trump was asked during a televised CNN Town Hall on Wednesday for his advice to Republicans on the possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I say to the Republicans out there — congressmen, senators — if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former U.S. president added: “I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave, because you don’t want to have that happen.”</p>
<p>Trump, who announced in November last year that he is running for president again in 2024, stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors.</p></blockquote>
<p>When pressed to clarify if he believes that &#8220;the U.S. should default if the White House does not agree to the spending cuts,&#8221; Trump promptly answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, you might as well do it now, because you’ll do it later. Because we have to save this country. Our country is dying. Our country is being destroyed by stupid people, by very stupid people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump has issued multiple warnings regarding the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar in recent months. He claimed last month that the USD is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-president-donald-trump-says-us-dollar-is-crashing-warns-were-very-close-to-world-war-iii/">crashing</a> and &#8220;will soon no longer be the world standard.&#8221; He also warned that &#8220;we are very close&#8221; to World War III.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has informed lawmakers that the Treasury Department may not be able to pay all of the government’s bills <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">as early as June 1</a> “if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.”</p>

The SEC is reportedly looking into potential violations of federal securities law.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Marathon&#8217;s Montana Mining Facility Under SEC Investigation, Company Receives Second Subpoena</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Marathon Digital Holdings (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MARA/">MARA</a>) was served with a second subpoena on April 10, 2023, following a previous subpoena in October 2020. The company disclosed the news in its May 10 <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001493152-23-016184/0001493152-23-016184.pdf">SEC filing</a>, revealing that it has now received a total of two subpoenas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the filing, the subpoena requires the company and certain executives to produce documents and communications related to the Hardin, Montana data center facility, which was previously described in a Form 8-K dated October 13, 2020. Marathon said it is fully cooperating with the investigation, and will provide the requested information to the SEC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The company received an additional subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023, relating to, among other things, transactions with related parties,” Marathon added. “We understand that the SEC may be investigating whether or not there may have been any violations of the federal securities law. We are cooperating with the SEC.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Marathon’s subpoena comes on the heels of the company&#8217;s announcement of a partnership with Abu Dhabi-based Zero Two. The two firms are planning to build two large-scale immersion-cooled crypto-mining facilities. However, the company&#8217;s shares have taken a hit, with a 5.14% drop in the past day and a 6.78% decline over the last five days against the U.S. dollar. Despite the recent drop, Marathon&#8217;s stock has been performing well this year, with a 184.41% increase in 2023.</p>

Thus far, PEPE has seen a 60% drop in value from its all-time high on May 5.</strong></p>
<h2>Rival Meme Tokens Challenge PEPE&#8217;s Dominance as Meme Token’s Value Plummets</h2>
<p>Despite retaining its position as the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token">third-largest meme token</a> in terms of market capitalization, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe">pepe (PEPE)</a> has been losing value since May 5, when it hit $0.00000431 per unit. Its value has since plummeted by 60% in USD terms. On May 8, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/meme-token-pepe-plunges-below-1-billion-mark-amidst-market-decline/">noted</a> that the digital currency&#8217;s market cap dwindled from $1.8 billion to $790 million.</p>
<p>As of May 11, PEPE&#8217;s market capitalization stands even lower at $680 million at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Over the past day, PEPE has shed another 14.9%, although its price remains up by a slight 2.3% within the last week. Furthermore, while it has lost 60% since hitting its record high on May 5, PEPE still boasts an impressive increase of 2,825% from its April 18 low point. In relation to global trade volume, PEPE&#8217;s figures have halved since May 8, now hovering around $417 million over the past day.</p>

<p>Rival meme tokens like WOJAK, TURBO, and LADYS have presented challenges for PEPE over the last two weeks. These newcomers have gained significant attention recently; for example, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/milady-meme-coin">milady meme coin (LADYS)</a> surged by a significant 3,520% within just one day. The meme currency <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/turbo">turbo (TURBO)</a> also climbed by an impressive 64% during the past week. Consequently, the overall meme token economy experienced a mild decline of 2.9% on Thursday, settling at a total of $17.2 billion.</p>
<p class="p1">
<p>While social media buzz suggests that whales might snap up more PEPE during this dip, the supply held by the <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/pepe/richlist/">top ten holders</a> decreased from 34.07% on May 8 to the current 33.93%. On the other hand, the top 100 PEPE holders increased their holdings from 54% on May 8 to a current figure of 56.15%. Additionally, the number of PEPE holders has swelled from 106,430 to the current tally of 107,617.</p>

&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing the challenges faced by users from low socio-economic backgrounds, EMCO Network aims to provide a novel platform to tap into their digital identities, generating financial opportunities while fostering organic online interactions. The project&#x2019;s robust and sustainable revenue model is built on its strong foothold in the precious metals industry.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">EMCO Network&#x2019;s blockchain strategy is designed to bring a new level of transparency, tracking, and authentication to the precious metals sector. This initiative aims to overcome the industry&#x2019;s inability to share sensitive information on a public ledger due to risk factors such as cargo interception. By ensuring the safety and integrity of the load, EMCO Network will promote transparency and validation of goods, benefiting all parties involved.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The deployment of Blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (BDLT) will give birth to ENERD, a Software as a Service (SaaS) rewards system, and a Defi platform. This initiative will provide financial inclusion and allow users to access the ENERD Dashboard/App and request a micro-task. The proprietary software solution, ENERD, issues unique micro-tasks to users determined by AI that analyzes data from connected platforms. These tasks, designed to promote organic engagement, will reward users with $EMCO tokens, which can be sold or staked in the Defi platform.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Defi platform provides fixed APYs based on fixed periods and the unique opportunity to exchange tokens for RWA NFTs; the user can redeem a physical asset in the form of a coin, round, or bar, depending on the value; assets include Gold, Silver, Platinum, Copper and select Gemstones. Users can hold these for safekeeping or choose to redeem the investment, which is sent via secure courier. KYC for courier redemption is subject to the value denoted in the user&#x2019;s local jurisdiction and the country&#x2019;s custom declaration laws. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relationships are being established at a local level across the globe that will allow users the ability to exchange their digital assets for physical assets at trusted and vetted bullion dealer partners. This will empower users the ability to convert easily into an asset class of physical value that they can use within local economies. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#13;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#13;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a user decides instead to convert un-redeemed NFTs back into <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> or $EMCO, a secondary marketplace will be available through EMCO that will allow other users to place bids on these NFTs at discounted rates.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#13;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">E.g; A buyer might put a bid of $10,000 at a 3% discount to purchase. Their <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> is sent to the smart contract and held. When a seller/s agrees to the rate, the smart contract will complete the trade, sending the tokens and NFT/s to the appropriate parties. Both buyers and sellers can place offers onto the market at their desired price points ensuring a dynamic and inclusive ecosystem.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project&#x2019;s tokenomic structure and revenue model are built around trading precious metals on a B2B level. EMCO Network has direct contracts with precious metal mines, refineries, and government sector customers. The project will use 40% of the profits for a buyback of $EMCO tokens, creating a reflex loop for the longevity of the ENERD platform, with an additional 10% going to the treasury vault. This outside liquidity from the profits of the business ensures the growth of the token and its APY offerings are supported by realized gains as opposed to hypothetical market returns.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The EMCO Network team comprises seasoned professionals with an average of 20 years of experience in various fields, including precious metal sourcing, blockchain-related technologies, and business management. This multicultural, diverse team is dedicated to creating value for society and the community.</span>&#13;<br />

Today&#x2019;s rise in price sees the cryptocurrency surge for a third straight day, despite recent market volatility. Cardano was also marginally higher.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) jumped back above $80.00 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, as the token continued to move away from recent lows.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following yesterday&#x2019;s low of $78.18, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $81.97 on Thursday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The surge saw litecoin rise from a recent six-week low of $75.32, which took the cryptocurrency to a breakout of a floor at $77.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s rally pushed the relative strength index (RSI) towards a resistance level of 39.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is currently tracking at 37.95, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> falling from earlier highs, and trading at $80.84.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Bulls in the market are likely targeting a ceiling of $85.00, however there will likely be some hurdles in the form upcoming points of resistance.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>) was also marginally higher, as prices traded close to a key support level on Wednesday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD hit a high of $0.3727 earlier in the day, which comes following a bottom at $0.3574 during yesterday&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Thursday&#x2019;s marginal gain sees cardano climb above a price floor of $0.3580, however earlier momentum has somewhat faded.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
It appears that gains have eased due to the RSI colliding with a ceiling at the 41.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Price strength is now at the 37.06 level, after failing to break out of the aforementioned resistance.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> is now trading at $0.3613, with bearish pressure significantly higher than earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
