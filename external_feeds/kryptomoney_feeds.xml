<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/moneygram-app-now-includes-crypto-trading-tools-for-bitcoin-ether-and-litecoin/">MoneyGram</a>, a former Ripple partner, and Frente Corretora, a current partner, have collaborated to launch a new <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/moneygram-launches-moneygram-online-mgo-website-in-brazil-301707173.html">remittance service</a> in Brazil with no fees for consumers. MoneyGram Online (MGO), a new service, allows customers to send money from Brazil to any country in the world in near real-time. Account deposit, mobile wallet, and cash pick-up from retail locations are among the services offered by the organization.<br /><br />MoneyGram Chairman and CEO Alex Holmes remarked:</p>
<p><em>“We’re confident that this launch will enable us to capture growth from new customer segments, deepen relationships with established customers, and create tremendous value for years to come.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/brazilian-congress-makes-move-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-payments/">Brazil</a> is becoming a more active user of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Latin American remittances abroad have increased significantly in recent years, according to the World Bank.<br /><br />Furthermore, according to Accenture&#8217;s 2022 Global Consumer Payments Research, Latin America is only second to Asia Pacific in terms of the adoption of next-generation payment platforms.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Brazil ranks ninth in terms of cryptocurrency users. According to Bloomberg, 32.3 million Brazilians, or 19% of the population, use cryptocurrency.<br /><br />Furthermore, in the SEC v. Ripple action, a recent motion accepted MoneyGram and &#8220;third party A&#8217;s&#8221; request to redact documents filed in conjunction with Daubert filings. This was done to protect Ripple&#8217;s confidential business ventures as well as the lawful privacy interests of third parties.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-reveals-over-33000000000-worth-of-bitcoin-in-its-reserves/">Coinbase</a> is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It debuted in 2012 and has a dedicated fan base. The exchange was also among the first to welcome a large number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The exchange just announced on one of its <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-secures-regulatory-approval-and-welcomes-new-country-director-in">blogs</a> that it has obtained a license to operate in Ireland.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Coinbase is delighted to announce that we have successfully registered with the Central Bank of Ireland as a Virtual Asset Service Provider, and to introduce Cormac Dinan as our new Country Director for Ireland.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the information, Coinbase has now secured an Irish virtual asset service provider license. The exchange will now be able to offer its services and goods to individuals in Ireland as a result of the license.<br /><br />Cormac Dinan was also named as the company&#8217;s new country director, according to the release. Dinan, who has more than 20 years of experience, will oversee the exchange&#8217;s activities in the country.<br /><br />According to the VASP, the exchange will be subject to the Criminal Justice Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act of 2010.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to strengthening Ireland’s operations and helping the sector’s continued growth. <em>&#8220;Creating an environment which champions innovation while strengthening trust in crypto is something I am really eager to progress,&#8221;</em> said Cormac Dinan.<br /><br />Coinbase Europe Limited and Coinbase Custody International Limited are covered by the VASP. Since 2018, the exchange has also been operational in Ireland. The exchange can now offer its services across the country thanks to its recent registration with the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>

<li>Polygon forged partnerships with some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies to build on its platform in 2022</li>
<li>778,000 smart contracts deployed on the Polygon network</li>
<li>Polygon anticipates a massive year for DeFi in 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>2022 was Polygon’s breakout year. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-up-8-amid-positive-news-polygon-sees-major-integration-with-the-graph-network/">Polygon</a> forged partnerships with some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies to build on its platform. 778,000 smart contracts deployed on the Polygon network. Polygon shares upcoming expectations for 2023 as it says it looks forward to delivering future-proof innovation with ZK solutions. It also anticipates a massive year for DeFi in 2023 while it hopes to support its builders and more in 2023 and beyond. Acentrik, a strategic initiative by Mercedes-Benz, is also building a decentralized data marketplace that will make it easy for enterprises to share and monetize data across domains. In the past week, Bermuda-based Jewel Bank announced it was issuing a fully backed stablecoin Jewel USD (JUSD) which would be accessed through the Polygon network. The blockchain will be used for JUSD transactions, and the bank will leverage the Polygon ecosystem for future commercial and retail stablecoin-based payment solutions. At the time of publication, MATIC was changing hands at $0.800, up 1.80% in the last 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1.300, $1.150, $1.000<br />Support Levels: $0.750, $0.500, $0.350</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63615 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Daily-Dec-21.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Daily-Dec-21.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Daily-Dec-21-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Daily-Dec-21-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Daily-Dec-21-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Daily-Dec-21-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Daily-Dec-21-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-prepares-for-next-move-polygon-based-projects-unlock-web3-onboarding-for-india/"> MATIC/USD</a> daily chart shows a recovery from the previous day&#8217;s low of $0.757 to an intraday high of $0.803. The first significant resistance level around the daily moving average MA 50 at $0.900 would probably cap any advance, barring a sustained cryptocurrency rally. Above here is the second important resistance level at $1.00<br /><br />The bulls will attempt to push the price over $0.900 if the price moves upward from present levels and crosses the $0.800 threshold. On the other hand, the bears are currently trying to keep the price below its $0.800 level. If they are successful, a previously-used buyer congestion zone between $0.700 and $0.800 is seen. Also, the MATIC/USD pair could test the MA 50 close in a subsequent rebound.</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63616 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-21.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-21.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-21-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-21-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-21-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-21-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-21-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>After losing both moving averages MA 50 and MA 200, MATIC is relying on the horizontal support level at $0.757 to hold. MATIC may decline as far as $0.700 if the support at $0.757 fails. The RSI is attempting to move past its middle means that the bulls will defeat the bears. On the other hand, the MA 50 resistance ceiling may restrict further price movement, delaying the bulls.<br /><br />Polygon (MATIC) might be propelled over significant obstacles at $0.850 and $0.900 with a breakout above the MA 50 closing at $0.950. Only when it trades above $0.870 around the MA 200 is the MATIC/USD pair bullish; significant resistance is located at the $0.850 and $0.900 levels.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s largest payment company, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/visa-plans-to-release-its-cryptocurrency-wallet/">Visa</a>, released a document on Monday outlining potential future automatic payment collaborations with the Ethereum network.<br /><br />Account abstraction, a <a href="https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/auto-payments-for-self-custodial-wallets.html">method developed</a> by Visa to enable automated programmable payments on the Ethereum network, makes use of smart contracts. According to reports from CoinDesk, Visa&#8217;s proposal would entail developing a smart contract that would serve as an intermediary between user accounts and a contract account and would enable the creation of a self-custodial wallet capable of making automatic and recurring payments without requiring user involvement. Visa advised that the feature be implemented on the Ethereum layer 2 network StarkNet and further stated that such a solution would enable recurring payments to be performed exclusively using blockchain networks. The Ethereum mainnet does not currently support these capabilities.<br /><br />Although cryptocurrency auto-payments won&#8217;t necessarily have the biggest influence on banking and payments, they do show that major payment companies like Visa are committed to taking an active role in the crypto field. In a conversation in the news, Visa&#8217;s Head of CBDC and Protocols stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We want to have an opportunity to actively contribute to technical developments happening in the crypto ecosystem. The best way to do that is learning by doing—actually getting deeper into Web3 infrastructures and blockchain protocols, areas I think are going to be really important for payments&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visa has some experience in the cryptocurrency world. Recently, Blockchain.com announced the introduction of a <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-visa-cards-in-canada-what-you-need-to-know/">pre-paid Visa card</a> focused on cryptocurrencies, each of which is connected to a verified Blockchain.com Wallet account. Customers utilizing these cards will be able to make online purchases of tangible products and services from U.S. retailers that accept Visa using their crypto or fiat balances.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-us-to-acquire-voyager-digital-assets/">Binance</a> is utilizing the current market conditions to enter the Asian market. On December 19, Binance announced that it had taken a majority stake in the Indonesian cryptocurrency exchange Tokocrypto. Pang Xue Kai, the company&#8217;s founder, and outgoing CEO had resigned, and Binance had since appointed a new CEO.<br /><br />To conduct business lawfully in Indonesia, according to <a href="https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/tech/20221219165022-37-398232/binance-caplok-tokocrypto-tunjuk-ceo-baru">CNBC Indonesia</a>, Binance intends to gradually purchase all of Tokocrypto&#8217;s shares. The exchange has all necessary licenses from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI).<br /><br />It is important to note that Binance has a long and strong partnership with the Indonesian exchange and has been investing in Tokocrypto since 2020.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tokocrypto came from our idea more than four years ago, and I am very proud to see every growth, achievement, and contribution that the company has made to advance Indonesia’s digital economy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pang Xue Kai continued by saying that this choice was &#8220;carefully&#8221; made with the exchange&#8217;s future in mind to take advantage of all the potential possibilities Binance has to offer and create a second physical trading platform for crypto assets.<br /><br />The crew at Tokocrypto had to be reduced, but interim CEO Yudhono Rawis emphasized that it was the best move to do to combat the difficult macroeconomic circumstances that were affecting the worldwide market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is regrettable that we have had to reduce the size of the company to ensure we remain in a good position to cope with the uncertain macroeconomic conditions and we extend our sincerest apologies to the affected employees.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By acquiring additional cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance is expanding into the Asian market and avoiding the time-consuming licensing procedures that have recently become more stringent as a result of the failure of numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and investment funds, including Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, FTX, and Alameda Research, among many others.</p>

<ul>
<li>The price of Dogecoin declined over 9% on Monday</li>
<li>DOGE is down 8.22% in the past 24 hours at $0.074</li>
<li>Dogecoin is establishing the <em>&#8220;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&#8221;</em> chart pattern, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt</li>
</ul>
<p>The price of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/doge-price-analysis-dogecoin-dips-10-onchain-data-shows-dogecoin-pumps-often-reliable-reflection-of-crowd-euphoria/">Dogecoin</a> declined over 8% on Monday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk asked Twitter users whether he should continue to run the social media platform. At the time of publication, DOGE was down 8.22% in the past 24 hours and 18.22% since the past week at $0.074. Dogecoin is establishing the<em> &#8220;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&#8221;</em> chart pattern, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt. The pattern&#8217;s unusual name is a reference to a popular English nursery rhyme for youngsters. It is designed to be sung while youngsters dance around in a circle. The lyrics depict a bunch of youngsters moving around a mulberry bush doing various tasks, such as collecting water and washing clothes. Brandt appears to be implying that Dogecoin is currently undergoing a <em>&#8220;round trip,&#8221;</em> which means that price gains are being followed by losses. The metaphor here is bringing up the fact that DOGE is incapable of advancing as it keeps spinning in circles.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.1100, $0.0922, $0.0750<br />Support Levels: $0.0654, $0.0550, $0.0500</p>
<h4>DOGE/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63602 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">DOGE/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>After hitting a low earlier this week, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/dogecoin-is-witnessing-a-selloff-after-an-impressive-rise-in-late-october/">DOGE/USD</a> pair is currently down but slightly higher. The price of the pair increased to an intraday high of $0.0754 after falling to a low of $0.0700 in the previous session. The rally is being driven by a desire to hold onto recent gains. After the RSI retreated towards the oversold zone, buyers saw the retracement as a chance to purchase the dip.<br /><br />Even the most bullish analyst expectations haven&#8217;t been met due to the massive loss, which started the month around the $0.1068 mark. The daily chart&#8217;s slight rebound suggests that the surge might be gaining momentum. Once momentum returns, the next target would be above $0.1000 and the recent high of $0.1589.</p>
<h4>DOGE/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63603 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DOGEUSD-Daily-Dec-20-1-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">DOGE/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>The 4-hour DOGE rise has slowed below the short-term moving average (MA 50). Although the recent climb to an intraday high of $0.0746 has placed the bears on the defensive. After the relative strength index revealed overextension, intraday traders profited. The present consolidation could provide the bulls with an opportunity to reorganize and catch their breath.<br /><br />The demand zone at $0.0700 is a critical support level for the rebound. On the upside, the nearest resistance is $0.0750, followed by the moving average (MA 50). And its breach might spark a further rise toward the all-time high of $0.1000. A close above the near-term resistance level of $0.0800 might indicate that sentiment favors higher prices in the immediate run.</p>

<p>A new drama is developing around Twitter as <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/dogecoin-jumps-8-as-elon-musk-renews-bid-to-buy-twitter-bitcoin-and-altcoins-rebound-on-this-potential-catalyst/">Elon Musk</a> prepares to consider some new candidates for that crucial position and is seriously considering stepping down as the platform&#8217;s CEO. Many people, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1604628658852970496">Edward Snowden</a>, have expressed their readiness to assume responsibility and their willingness to accept payment in Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I take payment in Bitcoin. <a href="https://t.co/wW0Qa9NxWi">https://t.co/wW0Qa9NxWi</a></p>
— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1604628658852970496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2022</a></blockquote>
<p>Elon Musk expressed a desire to hand over the reins of one of the biggest social media platforms in the world to someone else who is committed enough to do so, but the well-known security expert and Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiast responded. Snowden is not only prepared to take over as CEO but is also open to receiving bitcoin in exchange for his services.<br /><br />In the past, Snowden has said a lot of things about Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. He has never acknowledged accepting Bitcoin in exchange for his services, though. In the comments section below Snowden&#8217;s statement, some users made fun of the fact that Elon Musk does not particularly enjoy remote work, even though for Snowden, given his complicated relationship with the U.S. government, that is his only option.<br /><br />Snowden predicted the cryptocurrency market and the market as a whole back in November, urging his subscribers to start using safe DEX. Decentralized trading platforms saw a sharp increase in user traffic after the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-begins-its-proof-of-reserves-after-ftx-collapse/"> collapse of FTX</a> because, in theory, they are nothing more than sophisticated networks of interconnected wallets and addresses. Sadly, Musk is unlikely to give Snowden the CEO position and will probably select a different heir. Regarding the suggestion he made a few hours ago, Snowden has not yet made any further remarks.</p>

<p>Binance.US has reached a deal to acquire Voyager Digital&#8217;s assets. The bid from the cryptocurrency exchange also means that there&#8217;s a path for Voyager customer funds to be unlocked <em>&#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221;</em><br /><br />It was previously reported in November that CZ had confirmed that Binance US would be bidding for Voyager&#8217;s assets. Voyager confirmed today in an official announcement that the exchange will purchase the following assets:<br /><br />It was previously reported in November that CZ had confirmed that Binance US would be bidding for Voyager&#8217;s assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Our bid is a reflection of our guiding principle that customers should come first. Our goal is simple: return users their cryptocurrencies on the fastest timeline possible. […] We hope our selection brings to an end a painful bankruptcy process which saw customers unfairly dragged into it at no fault of their own. Upon close of the deal, users will be able to seamlessly access their digital assets on the Binance.US platform, where they will continue to receive future disbursements from the Voyager estate,&#8221; said Brian Shroder, CEO and President at Binance US.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/voyager-digital-survey-reveals-investors-are-more-bullish-on-crypto-despite-recent-market-crash/">Voyager</a> will now seek bankruptcy court approval to enter into an asset purchase agreement with Binance.US at a hearing scheduled for January 5, 2023.<br /><br />According to Schroder, once the deal is completed, Voyager customers will be able to access future disbursements of their crypto holdings through the Binance.US platform from the Voyager bankruptcy estate.<br />Voyager previously approved a bid for FTX to acquire its customer deposit accounts in a deal valued at $1.42 billion struck in late September. The Texas Securities Board was reviewing the offer before it fell through in November after FTX declared bankruptcy.<br /><br />Binance has come under increased scrutiny since FTX, the partner company of the American exchange, filed for bankruptcy. The major cryptocurrency exchange Binance has a licensing agreement with Binance.US, which is a separate legal entity. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, owns a majority interest in it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ways and methods by which businesses operate these days are being revolutionized by web 3.0. There is increased data searchability, personalized web, and fading out the usage of third parties. This indicates that businesses will now save resources and at the same time create solid relationships with clients. These are made possible by the implementation of web 3.0. In the web 3.0 space, NFTs are booming in brand development. NFTs projects are creating lots of buzz as virtual assets are making opportunities for brands to engage their target audience. All is possible through virtual platforms. You may wonder how to start your own <a href="https://www.business2community.com/nft/new-nft-projects">NFT project</a>; however, it should be known that the buzz around NFT is meaningful.</p>
<h2>Reasons to Start NFT Project for Your Business &#8211; NFT Statistics for 2022</h2>
<p>Here are some verified statistics that show the potential and growth of NFTs in 2022. 950,000 wallets were acquired and sold in the first quarter of 2022. In 2021, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/krakens-nft-marketplace-launches-in-beta/">NFT market</a> was valued at $41 billion. £30 billion is already spent on NFTs this year 2022, making this year&#8217;s investment valued higher than the 2021 total. The Merge was sold for $91.8 million, making it the most expensive NFT ever sold. Monthly, on OpenSea, approximately 250,000 people trade NFTs. Every week in the Blockchain, $10 to $20m worth of NFTs are sold.</p>
<h3>Application of NFTs to Your Business</h3>
<p>Seeing the achievement so far, it sounds interesting to know how to start your own NFT project. However, you need to learn how to <a href="https://www.socialplug.io/blog/how-to-promote-nft-s-on-twitter-5-best-strategies">grow your NFT project on Twitter</a> for a massive gain. Here is how to apply NFTs to your business.</p>
<p><strong>1. Trade Real-world Assets as NFTs</strong></p>
<p>The versatility of NFT construction makes it easy to present it as a real-world asset such as real estate or art. There are already real estate deals that were sealed through the sale of NFTs. NFTs are still new and growing. However, with this kind of transaction completed, the trend has already changed the status quo and eliminated the use of middlemen from the setting. Now resources can be conserved from transactions for other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use NFTs as a Community Enabler</strong></p>
<p>Several communities having the same interest and like-minded people are starting to use NFTs as validation tokens or means for accessing the community.

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-trading-at-this-juncture-implies-one-thing-this-is-what-on-chain-data-says/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> is slightly up in the last 24 hours at $1,186, but down 76% from its all-time high of $4,890. On-chain data suggests that Ethereum holders’ convictions might be at their highest despite the 2022 selloff. Long-term investors, referring to those who have held the token for more than six months, presently hold 80% of the ETH supply, according to Glassnode HODL waves data, which is quite comparable to the 2018 bear market level. The HODL wave is a metric that measures the number of investors who hold a specific digital asset. The fact that many long-term holders have yet to sell their holdings indicates their belief in the long-term worth of ETH. This suggests that most investors remain bullish on the asset and believe it will recover greatly in value over time. The bullishness stems from the fact that ETH supply has been deflationary on several occasions since the Merge event. According to analysts, greater network activity will result in a continuous deflationary supply.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1,700, $1,500, $1,300<br />Support Levels: $1,100, $1,000, $879</p>
<h4>ETH/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="773" class="alignnone wp-image-63584 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-Daily-Dec-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-Daily-Dec-18.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-Daily-Dec-18-300x161.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-Daily-Dec-18-1024x551.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-Daily-Dec-18-768x413.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-Daily-Dec-18-750x404.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-Daily-Dec-18-1140x614.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-ethereum-briefly-loses-1200-whales-quietly-add-to-holdings-amid-price-drop/">ETH/USD</a> plunged to lows of $1,155 on Friday, continuing the selling interest from the price level of $1,351. The MA 50 ($1,300), which recently made a bearish turn, stays above the price. The ETH/USD pair may touch the ascending trendline at the $1,100 level if it makes another downward move below the intraday low of $1,172.<br /><br />Additional declines could lead to the $879 bottom, which was registered on June 18. If upward pressure builds, ETH may encounter resistance before moving on to the $1,500 level. The $879 yearly low might also be the target for a retest following such a successful decline in this price region.</p>
<h4>ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63585 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Dec-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Dec-18.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Dec-18-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Dec-18-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Dec-18-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Dec-18-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-Hour-Dec-18-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>Following the pullback from recently recorded highs of $1,351, ETH is currently edging sideways, constrained beneath the MAs 50 and 200. On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has marginally crossed back above the 30 levels but is still within the oversold region. This might imply that a relief rally is possible for the upcoming sessions. The MA 200 at $1,230 might act as an immediate barrier.<br /><br />Overcoming this, the ETH/USD pair might reach a high of $1,300 before posing a threat to the $1,500–$1,700 range. Alternately, if the price drops below the $1,100 low, initial support could come from the $1,000 level before the $879 trough. Overall, Ethereum must hold the $1,100 support level, though it might be necessary to breach the $1,000 level.</p>
