			            <description><![CDATA[According to new data, investors have renewed their interest in Ethereum-based NFTs as the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">While non-fungible tokens (NFTs) took a nosedive in popularity last year due to dwindling investor sentiments, the asset class has been gaining renewed user interest since the start of the year.</p>
<p class="p1">The NFT market has seen strong activity over the past few weeks as the broader crypto market gradually recovers from the 2022 crypto winter. New data suggests that Ethereum-based NFTs have witnessed a massive surge in activity over the past couple of weeks.</p>
<h2 class="p2"><b>Ethereum NFT Projects Record Increased User Activities</b></h2>
<p class="p1">According to <a href="https://twitter.com/themlpx/status/1615340678061621252?t=2iwmiSG3vGiGlUzCqO218w&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">data</a> provided by <span class="s1">Nansen data journalist</span> Martin Lee, Ethereum-based NFT projects have seen an increase in their weekly transactions for five consecutive weeks.</p>
<p class="p1">As per the info, the general uptrend in this weekly number of transactions began on November 4, 2022, with recent transaction volumes reaching highs of more than 700,000 weekly.</p>
<p class="p1">Leading NFT marketplace <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-to-buy-and-sell-your-first-nft-on-opensea-a-step-by-step-guide/" data-wpel-link="internal">OpenSea</a> accounted for a significant portion of these transactions, closely followed by Mints, LooksRare, and X2Y2.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition to the high transaction volume, the past few weeks have seen a consistent increase in Ethereum NFT users.</p>
<p class="p1">As per the data, the number of NFT users on Ethereum has increased for three consecutive weeks. There are nearly 250,000 NFT users on the network, with OpenSea also accounting for the bulk of this figure.</p>
<h2 class="p2"><b>NFT Wash Trading Still a Concern</b></h2>
<p class="p1">NFTs have been one of the most prominent parts of Web3 over the last three years. The NFT market saw explosive growth during the 2021 bull run, but this growth was not consistent and leveled off in 2022.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the market is quickly gaining momentum, with renewed investor sentiment thanks to a few popular projects.</p>
<p class="p1">With the growing popularity of digital collectibles, the NFT marketplace sector has become increasingly competitive as new platforms launch constantly. The influx of new NFT marketplaces has opened the door to wash trading.</p>
<p class="p1">According to a <span class="s1">recent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nearly-60-of-nft-trading-volumes-in-2022-was-wash-trading-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">report</a></span>, nearly 60% of all NFT trading volumes on Ethereum in 2022 were wash trading, with several marketplaces engaging in this activity themselves.</p>

<p>First Genesis, now Coindesk. Barry Silbert&#8217;s empire appears to be in trouble, as it is apparently considering selling part of its subsidiaries to address liquidity issues.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2023, Kevin Worth, CEO of CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency-focused news site subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, reported that the company hired investment bankers from Lazard LTD to help them explore options for a partial or complete sale of the company.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-media-outlet-coindesk-taps-bankers-for-potential-sale-11674076000" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by The Wall Street Journal, Worth talked about how potential investors were interested in owning the digital media outlet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over the last few months, we have received numerous inbound indications of interest in CoinDesk,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, until now, everything was kept private —<em>if</em> there has been any intention to sell the company.</p>
<h2>DCG&#8217;s Liquidity Issues</h2>
<p>According to its own site, Coindesk receives over <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/advertise/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">5 million</a> visitors per month (Similarweb <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/coindesk.com/#overview" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reports</a> over 10 million visitors), organizes the  &#8220;<a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Consensus</a>&#8221; summit —one of the biggest crypto events in the United States— and has expanded to different products, including a newsletter and a YouTube Channel.</p>
<p>Seems successful, but the reasons behind its parent company&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dcg-suspends-quarterly-dividends-amidst-genesis-crisis-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">liquidity issues</a> don&#8217;t come from a poorly performing media site but instead are attributed mainly to the FTX contagion and a fight with the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange after DCG-owned crypto lender Genesis halted withdrawals, messing with Gemini&#8217;s &#8220;Earn&#8221; program.</p>
<p>The Winklevii have publicly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-the-removal-of-dcg-ceo-barry-silbert/" data-wpel-link="internal">called for the resignation</a> of DCG CEO Barry Silbert and accused the company of not responding to their attempts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently sued both DCG and Genesis for allegedly selling unregistered securities.</p>
<p>As CryptoPotato recently reported, Genesis <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-lender-genesis-slashes-staff-and-mulls-bankruptcy-wsj/" data-wpel-link="internal">may be preparing to file for bankruptcy</a> this week after failing to raise cash, as the crypto fund was left with a financial gap of more than $175 million in the wake of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/these-are-the-most-shocking-findings-from-ftxs-bankruptcy-filing/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX&#8217;s collapse</a>, which prevented it from resuming customer withdrawals.</p>
<h2>What Should Be Expected</h2>
<p>The potential sale of CoinDesk or Genesis, along with other important DCG-owned crypto businesses such as Foundry, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-ceo-will-consider-massive-share-buyback-if-sec-lawsuit-fails/" data-wpel-link="internal">Grayscale Investments</a>, and Luno, might help solve part —or all— of DCG&#8217;s financial issues but could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>In a worst-case scenario, DCG may even consider selling part of its cryptocurrency holdings to stay afloat. However, it is worth noting that Grayscale Investments alone holds a large amount of Bitcoin, with 631,460 BTC ($13 billion) in its possession. This suggests that its financial troubles may not be as dire as they seem and that the company may have a buffer to fall back on.</p>
<p>Regardless, the news of DCG&#8217;s liquidity issues and potential sale of subsidiaries has raised concerns in the cryptocurrency community and highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the industry.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, he remains a proponent of the industry, admitting that he invested 5% of his wealth in bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Future Trouble Seems Inevitable</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xckrkxhrP4M&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">interview</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for Kitco News, O&#8217;Leary forecasted that the FTX demise will certainly not be the last such event in the cryptocurrency space. He claimed some of the &#8220;unregulated exchanges&#8221; are reluctant to work with an auditing firm to present accurate liquidity details, which has pushed institutions away:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;If you&#8217;re asking me if there&#8217;s going to be another meltdown to zero? Absolutely. One hundred percent it&#8217;ll happen, and it&#8217;ll keep happening over and over and over again.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite his concerns with trading venues, O&#8217;Leary remains a keen supporter of the digital asset industry, particularly bitcoin. He admitted buying BTC amounts recently, while in total, his allocation to it represents 5% of his wealth.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[DCG's subsidiary underwent a second round of job cuts after being hit by FTX implosion. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barry Silbert&#8217;s crypto conglomerate, Digital Currency Group (DCG), revealed halting quarterly dividends until further notice.</p>
<p>In an email to shareholders, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/digital-currency-group-halts-dividend-payment-to-conserve-cash#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">viewed</a> by Bloomberg, the crypto investment firm said it is currently focused on &#8220;reducing operating expenses and preserving liquidity&#8221; in response to the current market environment.</p>
<h2>Troubles for DCG</h2>
<p>The FTX collapse exposed significant irregularities in Barry Silbert’s empire, with DCG at the receiving end of intense scrutiny. The venture capital firm owns several subsidiaries, including the world’s biggest digital asset manager, Grayscale, institutional lending company Genesis, and advisory company Foundry.</p>
<p>As a result of the financial distress, Genesis was forced to pause new loan originations and redemptions &#8211; a move that directly affected the Gemini Earn program. This subsequently escalated the battle with the co-founder of the crypto exchange, Cameron Winklevoss, who accused DCG of misrepresentation and accounting fraud and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-the-removal-of-dcg-ceo-barry-silbert/" data-wpel-link="internal">called</a> for Silbert to step down.</p>
<p>It was earlier reported that Genesis owes users of Winklevoss’ high-yield savings product Gemini Earn $900 million. DCG and Gemini earlier assured investors that the two companies have been trying to find a solution.</p>
<h2>SEC Targets &#8216;Gemini Earn&#8217; Program</h2>
<p>While the fate of the customer funds stuck in the Gemini Earn program continued to hang in limbo, the fallout between the two executives led Gemini to terminate its master loan agreement with Genesis, thereby &#8220;officially&#8221; ceasing the program. This move requires Genesis to return outstanding assets.</p>
<p>A day later, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-files-complaint-against-gemini-and-genesis-for-allegedly-selling-unregistered-securities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> the two crypto firms for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities to investors through the program. SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today’s charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws. Doing so best protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It’s not optional. It’s the law.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, Genesis is currently swimming in an astonishing debt of $3 billion, and in a bid to repay some of its debt, DCG was looking to sell off the crypto broker&#8217;s venture capital portfolios. As such, a New-York headquartered global investment bank &#8211; Moelis &#8211; was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dcg-looking-to-sell-off-some-assets-as-genesis-owes-creditors-over-3b-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">hired</a> to explore options to cover part of Genesis&#8217; debt crisis. However, talks of fresh capital injection into the crypto lender appear to be off the table.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Genesis Global Capital is preparing to finally file for bankruptcy after FTX’s collapse blew a hole through the company’s financials, according to people familiar with the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bankruptcy may be filed as soon as this week.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Per a </span><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-firm-genesis-is-preparing-to-file-for-bankruptcy-1.1871827#:~:text=Genesis%20Global%20Capital%20is%20laying,groups%20amid%20a%20liquidity%20crunch." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from Bloomberg on Wednesday, talks over the bankruptcy are still ongoing, and plans could change. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after FTX’s collapse, Genesis </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/genesis-will-go-bankrupt-without-fresh-funding-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">indicated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it may need to file for bankruptcy if it didn’t receive fresh funding.

			            <description><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried claims Sullivan and Cromwell failed to account for FTX US’s cash balance when assessing the exchange’s solvency. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">FTX’s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, has reiterated claims that FTX US is solvent following FTX debtors’ latest statements to the contrary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Bankman-Fried, the group failed to account for customers’ bank balances, which bring the US entity’s assets well above its liabilities to customers. </span></p>
<h2>Clearing the Air on FTX US</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a </span><a href="https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-us-balance-update-2023-01-17" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">substack post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on Wednesday, Bankman-Fried said that certain statements on Tuesday from Sullivan and Cromwell (S&amp;C; one of the law firms managing FTX’s bankruptcy) were “extremely misleading” as they pertain to FTX US’s solvency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time, the law firm stated that the assets it had managed to identify belonging to the exchange were “substantially less than the aggregate third-party customer balances suggested by the electronic ledger for FTX US.” In a separate presentation, the firm also claimed there were significant asset shortfalls at both FTX International and FTX US.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These claims by S&amp;C are wrong, and contradicted by data later on in the same document,” said Bankman-Fried. “FTX US was and is solvent, likely with hundreds of millions of dollars in excess of customer balances.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bankman-Fried told the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sbf-says-ftx-us-should-be-solvent-unsure-why-withdrawals-not-enabled/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">same story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about the US exchange both before and after the FTX Group filed it for bankruptcy in November, as both exchanges’ assets were separated. Similarly, John J. Ray III – FTX’s new boss overseeing the bankruptcy – </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-used-client-assets-for-margin-trading-at-alameda-confirms-bankruptcy-lawyer/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Congress last month that FTX US assets were separate from Alameda Research’s, with which FTX International had comingled its funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, Bankman-Fried asserted that FTX US has a positive balance sheet within the realm of $400 million in excess cash. He arrives at this figure by including the $428 million within FTX US’s bank accounts as an asset – which he said Cromwell has failed to do. </span></p>
<h2>The Numbers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Specifically, the law firm presented customer balances as worth $497 million, exceeding the $181 million in digital assets FTX US had identified associated with the exchange. Thus, Cromwell concluded that FTX had a major asset shortfall. When including the exchange’s bank account balance, however, this shortfall becomes a surplus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, Bankman-Fried contested that the $497 million customer balance figure was outdated, taken before FTX US had experienced massive withdrawals. In reality, he believed the figure to be about $199 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Comparing $609 million in total cash and digital assets to a $199 million customer balance figure, Bankman-Fried concluded that FTX US had “at least $111m, and likely around $400m” in excess cash before bankruptcy. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FTX US is solvent,” he said. “Customers should be given access to their funds.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of the $181 million in digital assets identified as being associated with FTX US, $90 million has </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-us-discovers-another-90-million-missing/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">gone missing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, according to the exchange’s debtors on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bankman-Fried has </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-trial-date-set/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">pleaded not guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to charges of wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and other accusations suggesting he had cheated investors. By contrast, Alameda Research’s former CEO Caroline Ellison, as well as Bankman-Fried former right hand Gary Wang, have </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-alameda-crisis-caroline-ellison-gary-wang-plead-guilty-to-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">pleaded guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to similar charges.  </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is up massively since the start of the year – but does that really mean the bull market is back? ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin’s rise within the past two weeks has made it one of the best-performing assets of the year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The firm’s senior macro strategist, Mike McGlone, compares the rally to a similar recovery in early 2019 – but in a macro environment of contracting liquidity. </span></p>
<h2>Is Bitcoin Back?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7021448003840274432/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to LinkedIn on Wednesday, the analyst said that Bitcoin’s rally from the start of the year until January 17 may either signal either a bottom or a “bouncing bear.” Bloomberg’s bias, he said, is both – but with a key distinction compared to 2019’s early-year turnaround. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Federal Reserve is tightening this time around,” he said. The $5,000 pivot about four years ago vs. $20,000 now may portend Bitcoin&#8217;s elongated trajectory.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin price has historically moved in four-year cycles, with feverish bull runs in one year followed by dramatic corrections in the next – alongside less active, more modest gains in the intervening years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin retraced from a peak of over $19,000 in late 2017 to a bottom of roughly $3200 in December 2018, before bouncing back to $5,000 by April 2019. In its most recent cycle, Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 in November 2021 before retracing to under $16,000 in November 2022. Today, Bitcoin has already returned above its 2017 highs, prompting </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/is-the-bitcoin-bottom-in-or-not-crypto-analysts-disagree/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> among analysts around whether history is repeating itself almost exactly four years later. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bitcoin’s roughly 80% drawdown to the 2022 low about matches the 2018 bottom, but a key difference is global liquidity is contracting,” wrote McGlone. “It’s unlikely a trough, and recovery for the asset referred to as the fastest horse in the race will be easy.”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>The Fed’s Influence</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From early 2022 until now, the Federal Reserve has been hastily hiking interest rates to combat record-high CPI inflation in the United States. The ensuing global liquidity crunch has indeed reigned in prices – but also ravaged the crypto market, and forced industry leaders like </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-dismisses-950-people-citing-current-economic-climate/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/no-respite-from-layoffs-crypto-com-cuts-20-workforce/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">CryptoCom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to downsize substantially. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most notably, contracting prices have triggered a downward spiral of bankruptcies and forced liquidations, from lending firms, to mining companies, to exchanges like </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-us-discovers-another-90-million-missing/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">FTX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By comparison, the Federal Reserve was easing interest rates in 2019 when Bitcoin built its base around $5000. “Another 60 bps of hikes expected into June is Bitcoin resistance” stated McGlone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin’s rally this month was largely spurred by a promising December CPI report, which </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/enhanced-bitcoin-volatility-as-us-cpi-numbers-clock-in-at-6-5/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">registered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> annual inflation at 6.5%, down from 7.1% the previous month. Such signs show investors in both crypto and stocks that the Fed may soon be able to return to a more dovish monetary policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some analysts, however, doubt this is the case. David Kelly – Asset Management Chief Global Strategist for JP Morgan Chase – </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/jp-morgan-analyst-calls-on-fed-to-stop-hiking-interest-rates/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">predicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last week that the Fed will continue hiking rates until May, at which point it will hold its benchmark rate above 5% until the year’s end. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The question is: will the economy be strong enough to allow them to hold rates at that relatively high level?” asked Kelly at the time. </span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Despite the attempted recovery at the beginning of the year, Binance clearly has many challenges in the outlook for 2023. However, it also has some unique advantages. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market staged an early recovery at the beginning of 2023, but many remain skeptical as to whether the ongoing rally will last.</p>
<p>Some exchanges, including Coinbase and Crypto.com, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-dismisses-950-people-citing-current-economic-climate/" data-wpel-link="internal">continue</a> with their staff cuts in a bid to weather the macro bear market, but others remain resilient. Case in point &#8211; Binance.</p>
<p>BNB Coin is the native token of the exchange. It&#8217;s a base layer cryptocurrency and operates as the base unit of currency for the Build &#8216;N&#8217; Build Chain (formerly: Binance Smart Chain) or BNB Chain. It also works as originally intended, as a utility token for the exchange, offering users perks like discounts on trading fees and a nerdy cult of intensely deflationary tokenomics.</p>
<p>The following summary outline is not a precise <em>BNB Coin price prediction</em>. But instead, it provides an overview of some selected major potential headwinds and tailwinds BNB faces over the course of 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bnb_bull_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-233803" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bnb_bull_cover.jpg" alt="bnb_bull_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bnb_bull_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bnb_bull_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bnb_bull_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bnb_bull_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bnb_bull_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>Four Major Tailwinds for BNB&#8217;s Price in 2023</h2>
<h3>Bull Run: BTC Price Could Continue Rallying</h3>
<p>The Bitcoin price is the fundamental force of gravity in the crypto exchange market economy. As the price of Bitcoin goes, so goes the price of altcoins.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-ethereums-bear-market-continue-in-2023-6-key-considerations-op-ed/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum network has increasingly</a> challenged its dominance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even at this advanced stage of Ethereum deployment and development, its prices are inextricably intertwined with the economics of Bitcoin. They bear a strong statistical correlation.</p>
<p>So, crypto investors can expect the BNB to take a ride up or down on Bitcoin&#8217;s coattails along with Ethereum and other altcoins. The question is, which way will Bitcoin&#8217;s price go?</p>
<p>Although there are reasons to be cautious, there are also many reasons to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/will-bitcoin-price-winter-continue-in-2023-8-key-considerations/" data-wpel-link="internal">expect</a> a bull run for Bitcoin sometime in 2023.</p>
<p>These include renewed confidence in the crypto sector after several of the bad actors have washed out. 2022&#8217;s troubles also renewed all the old reasons to stick with decentralized, Layer-1 cryptos with active user bases over centralized apps with an ERC-20 run by a gaggle of incautious and unscrupulous middlemen.</p>
<p>Bitcoin could also rally on a macro equities rally if stocks pick up in 2023. But mainly, it&#8217;s a powerful product with strong fundamentals and a bright future ahead of it through the next decade and beyond.</p>
<p>Eventually, when the macro risk-off mood transitions into risk appetite, these attractive prices will be impossible for investors to pass up. And then there are institutional investors and big hedge funds right around the corner to think about. If Bitcoin gets legs in 2023, BNB will almost certainly be in for the chase.</p>
<h3>Clarity: U.S. Regulators Could Issue Clear Rules</h3>
<p>At the moment, the entire cryptocurrency industry is trapped in regulatory limbo in the United States.</p>
<p>Because of the federalism (shared powers) of the U.S. government and the sophistication of capital markets in our day, no one is sure yet who is really in charge of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Crypto is, in fact, so novel an invention that it simply doesn&#8217;t neatly fit into the preexisting categories that U.S. legislators, regulators, and courts had dealt with before.</p>
<p>Binance and its platform&#8217;s native token are stuck in a worse regulatory trap than its peers on the U.S. front. It hasn&#8217;t been able to get listed on any U.S. exchanges other than its own because the proprietors fear it&#8217;s a risky token.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re concerned, despite its strong, active userbase and enormous market cap, because BNB could suddenly be subject to SEC regulation as a security like stocks and derivatives.</p>
<p>But could BNB be classified as security even in the event the case is brought up?</p>
<p>In its case against FTX Exchange, the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-234.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">SEC argued before</a> the United States District Court Southern District of New York that <a>FTT tokens are securities</a>.</p>
<p>Because part of its argument was FTX exchange has a &#8220;buy and burn&#8221; program &#8211; similar to stock buybacks &#8211; and Binance burns tokens out of quarterly profits &#8211; crypto exchanges are wary that BNB could be ruled a security.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not necessarily clear that Binance&#8217;s token burns operate the same way as FTX&#8217;s buy and burn program. And BNB is not just a liquid digital asset whose market price can be manipulated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a script for interoperability with developers&#8217; apps and the base layer blockchain, BNB Chain. It&#8217;s almost more like a form of speech than it is like a share in a public corporation.</p>
<p>Besides, it would be pretty tough for the situation to end up with Ether classified as a security <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/senator-cynthia-lummis-bill-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">instead of a commodity</a> born out of a global decentralized computer. And if Ether is a commodity and not a security, it would be pretty tough to make BNB stay a security.</p>
<p>If Congress or an agreement of regulators rules BNB a commodity along with Bitcoin and Ether, it will immediately lift an enormous source of investor uncertainty.</p>
<h3>Reputation: Binance Stands Strong</h3>
<p>The Forbes Digital Assets Column <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2023/01/10/binance-is-bleeding-assets-12-billion-gone-in-less-than-60-days/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">headlined a story</a> about Binance and BNB Coin: &#8220;Binance Is Bleeding Assets, $12 Billion Gone In Less Than 60 Days&#8221;</p>
<p>That is an enormous amount of reserves for Binance to draw from internally to fulfill all its customer&#8217;s withdrawal orders. You could say it sounds pretty bad, but when the average crypto investor considers that Binance remained solvent, it sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>They were good for the money. Exchange executives have said on multiple occasions that Binance is ready to service and honor every single customer&#8217;s withdrawal request, even if it meant withdrawing every penny from the platform.</p>
<p>At some point this month, Binance processed over $7 billion in withdrawals in a single day.</p>
<p>There was no freeze on account withdrawals and new accounts. There were no bankruptcies or SEC investigations. Binance customers just got their crypto out or their money back out. They won&#8217;t forget that. It stands as a real-world stress test that sent several other custodians tumbling, but not Binance.</p>
<p>The reputation they have developed out of that will continue to make them irresistible. Investors and traders and new crypto projects with top talent and ideas noticed.</p>
<h3>Fundamentals: A Closer Look</h3>
<p>BNB&#8217;s biggest tailwind it&#8217;s got going for it is the <a href="https://nomics.com/exchanges/binance" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">sheer volume</a> of crypto trades executed by its platform and the fees it collects on facilitating those exchanges.</p>
<p>Binance handles billions worth of daily traded volume. It charges fees on those transactions to both cryptocurrency buyers and sellers, ranging in percentages.</p>
<p>According to a recent report by Arcane Research, Binance&#8217;s share of BTC trading volume rose over 2022 to finish the year at 92% of trade volume. Arcane Research concluded:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;No matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market. After lifting trading fees for its BTC spot pairs this summer, Binance completely overtook all market share in the spot market.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In essence, Binance is a profitable private business that keeps getting greenlighted in more and more jurisdictions across the world.</p>

<h2>Two Major Headwinds for BNB Coin Price in 2023</h2>
<h3>Bear Rout: BTC Could Take More Discounts in 2023</h3>
<p>It seems like the bargain Bitcoin price should attract more eager buyers. But some disagree.</p>
<p>The price of bitcoin is a complex variable comprised of all kinds of macro, fundamental, industry, and technical factors. There&#8217;s no guarantee the bottom is in yet, and the crypto winter could go on for another year for all anyone knows until the market has moved.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price could take another sustained dive in 2023. It could remain depressed with low volatility. It could rangebound nowhere with no forthcoming rally. That would likely exert a headwind for the BNB price.</p>
<p>Possible bear case scenarios for the Bitcoin price in 2023 are: the crypto business insolvency crisis could continue to unravel badly, there could be more shocks to investor confidence, U.S. regulatory ambiguity toward crypto could, and so forth.</p>
<p>If this happens, crypto investors can expect it to be a headwind for the BNB price as well.</p>
<h3>Regulatory Antagonism or Ambiguity</h3>
<p>Regulators in the U.S. have been strict toward Binance, probably for security as well as global strategic adversarial reasons. They could soon act to rule BNB as security.</p>
<p>BNB hasn&#8217;t been able to get listed on any US exchanges except for Binance US. That could be because they&#8217;re concerned regulators could move at any time to rule BNB as a security. If that happens, it will fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC.</p>
<p>This can cause the price to take a beating if it ever happens, but it also will certainly be no death knell for BNB.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[What is PI Network? Is it a scam? Let's take a deeper dive into the project and the most recent controversy. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pi Network is a controversial cryptocurrency project that has been making rounds across the crypto industry over the past few weeks after the token was listed on some crypto exchanges, including the popular trading platform Huobi.</p>
<p>Since its inception four years ago, the project has attracted millions worldwide as users can mine and earn its native token, dubbed Pi, by completing simple tasks.</p>
<p>Some experts have raised concerns about the legitimacy of the Pi Network, claiming the project is nothing but a classic Ponzi Scheme seeking to defraud investors in the long run. But is this true? Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<p>This article unravels everything about Pi Network, from its beginning to its latest controversial listing.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="what">What is Pi Network?</h2>
<p>Pi Network is a cryptocurrency project that allows users to perform mining operations through their smartphones. The platform was designed to onboard anyone into the crypto space, regardless of their familiarity with digital assets.</p>
<p>Pi Network is the brainchild of Stanford University graduates – Nicolas Kokkalis, Chengdiao Fan, Aurélien Schiltz, and Vince McPhillips. The team started developing the project in 2018, but they released the whitepaper and launched the application a year later, on March 14, 2019.</p>
<p>Miners on the Pi Network are rewarded with the Pi coin, which the project&#8217;s creators claim will gain value once the protocol launches to mainnet.</p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin miners, individuals who mine on the Pi Network are called Pioneers. The project claims to simplify the mining process as Pioneers only need to tap a button every 24 hours to conduct mining activity via their smartphones. The mining process is done on the Pi Network app, which is available for Android and iOS devices.</p>
<p>The project uses a multi-level marketing (MLM) approach to grow its user base. For clarity, an MLM, similar to a pyramid scheme, is a controversial marketing strategy where existing users are rewarded for inviting new users to the ecosystem. The new members, in turn, get commissioned to onboard more people.</p>
<p>In the case of Pi Network, existing users (referrers) receive more Pi coins for inviting new ones (referees) to join the network. When the referee joins the platform and becomes active, the referrer gets a specific percentage bonus on their daily mining.</p>
<p>This scheme has heavily facilitated the growth of the project&#8217;s customer base. The ecosystem currently is advertised to have more than 35 million active global users.</p>
<p>Pi Network mandates users to complete a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process, unlike other decentralized mining protocols. Here, users will provide personal information about themselves. According to the project, this process helps to prevent users from creating multiple accounts.</p>
<h2 id="how">How Does the Pi Network Work?</h2>
<p>Pi Network claims to use a consensus mechanism called the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). SCP is an algorithm that enables users to receive rewards for contributing to the network. The project claims that SCP is faster, more secure, and more scalable than other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).</p>
<p>The Pi Network community is made up of four roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pioneers (Miners)</li>
<li>Contributors (Securers)</li>
<li>Ambassadors (Distributors)</li>
<li>Nodes (Validators)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pioneers (Miners)</h3>
<p>Pioneers are users who perform mining activities on the Pi Network. Users in this category verify that they are humans and not robots by clicking a button on the Pi network app every 24 hours to conduct mining activity. Currently, the <a href="https://minepi.com/blog/pi-day-2022-news" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">total number of pioneers</a> on the network is around 35 million, according to reports produced by the project itself.</p>
<p>While Pi Network claims to perform mining operations, the fact is that no actual mining activities are taking place. How so? <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/#q2" data-wpel-link="internal">Crypto mining</a> generally involves processing and verifying transactions by solving complex computational math problems. Once the transactions are validated, they are added to a distributed ledger built on the blockchain. Miners are then rewarded with newly minted digital assets for their contributions to the network.</p>
<p>The Pi Network, on its part, currently has no functional blockchain network. This means no transactions are occurring on the platform, so there is no use for miners on the protocol.</p>
<p>In its effort to release a blockchain network (mainnet), the project&#8217;s developers announced the launch of an <a href="https://minepi.com/blog/enclosed-mainnet" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">enclosed mainnet</a> in late December 2021. This network layer is designed for testing and gathering data before the future launch of its mainnet. According to the developers, the Pi Network mainnet will be released when the Open Mainnet is ready. The Open Mainnet currently has no launch date.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pi_network_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-233785" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pi_network_cover.jpg" alt="pi_network_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pi_network_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pi_network_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pi_network_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pi_network_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pi_network_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h3>Contributors (Securers)</h3>
<p>After actively mining for three days, Pioneers qualify to become Contributors. Contributors are Pioneers who belong to a security circle consisting of three to five users. Being a network Contributor entitles one to higher Pi coin rewards.</p>
<p>Security Circle is a group of three to five users on the Pi network who trust one another.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that one user can be added to multiple security circles.</p>
<h3>Ambassadors (Distributors)</h3>
<p>Users become Ambassadors (distributors) when they invite new people to the Pi Network through their referral code. Ambassadors receive a 25% boost on their earnings for each user they invite to join the network. This means that the higher the number of invitees, the larger the earning rate for the Ambassador.</p>
<p>Unlike the Contributor category, where users can be added to multiple security circles, an invitee can only join one Ambassador&#8217;s earning team.</p>
<h3>Nodes (Validators)</h3>
<p>Pioneers can become validators in the network by running a Pi software node on a desktop or personal computer. By running a node, validators are rewarded with an additional boost in their Pi mining process.</p>
<p>The network currently boasts over 10,000 active testnet nodes. The project&#8217;s creators claim the nodes will join in securing the Pi blockchain once the mainnet Open Network goes live.</p>
<h2 id="list">Pi Coin Controversial Listings: Where Can You Trade Pi?</h2>
<p>As of January 18, 2023, there is no fixed date when the Pi coin will be listed for trading. Since its launch in 2019, the project has failed to garner value for the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Pi Network&#8217;s roadmap features three phases. The team has achieved the first two phases: the project&#8217;s design, distribution, trust graph bootstrap, and testnet.</p>
<p>According to the whitepaper, the Pi blockchain will be released when Phase 3 of the mainnet goes live.</p>
<p>In December 2022, several crypto exchanges, including Huobi, BitMart, and XT.com, listed a synthetic version of the Pi coin with the trading pair PI/USDT. However, it is worth noting that the digital asset tagged Pi coin in these exchanges is simply I-owe-you (IOU) tokens that users can use to speculate on Pi&#8217;s price movement. This means Pi holders cannot deposit or sell their accumulated tokens on these exchanges.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-pi-network-controversy-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" data-wpel-link="internal">a frenzy sparked</a> around the supposed launch of the long-awaited Pi coin, the project developers announced that they do not endorse any listing of Pi carried out by any exchange. The team added that users should not &#8220;engage with any of these exchanges or third-party actors as their actions are not affiliated with Pi Network.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="scam">Is Pi Coin a Scam?</h2>
<p>Since Pi Network started gaining traction, experts have raised concerns about the project&#8217;s legitimacy, security, and potential for fraud. However, it&#8217;s hard to label Pi Network as an outright scam since the project does not require users to pay to access the platform&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is worth noting that users could be robbed of their time as the activities they perform on the platform may fail to yield profit in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="final">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, Pi Network is a crypto project that allows users to perform mining operations through their smartphones and earn rewards in the form of Pi coin, the native cryptocurrency of the network. A group of Stanford University graduates created the platform to make it easy for anyone to get involved in the cryptoverse.</p>
<p>While the project has attracted many users worldwide, some experts have questioned the legitimacy of the platform and whether or not it is a Ponzi Scheme. The recent listing of a synthetic version of the Pi coin on some popular exchanges has also made the project controversial because Pi developers have warned users to desist from trading the token on such platforms.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Wednesday, the United States Department of Justice announced an international cryptocurrency enforcement action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Department arrested the founder of Bitzlato – a Chinese crypto exchange involved in servicing financial criminals</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The DOJ </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/live" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">broke the news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on Wednesday, alongside representatives from the FBI, OFAC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). OFAC administers the US sanctions regime, while FinCEN monitors suspicious activity among financial institutions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The department explained that Bitzlato fueled darknet marketplaces and aided in the process of ransomware attacks, amounting to over $700 million in direct and indirect illegal transfers between 2018 and 2022.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The exchange became attractive to criminals due to its minimal requirements for user-identifying information, as is typical of most larger exchanges.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ransomware is a crime cryptocurrency is often leveraged for, due to its irreversibility and anonymity. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coordinated operations like these against Bitzlato are the lynchpins of international success against cybercrime,” the department said. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">To anyone who still believes that they can hide from the law by using cryptocurrency, this prosecution should put that illusion to rest,” said an accompanying US attorney for the Eastern District of New York.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The announcement comes at a time of major turmoil across the crypto industry, particularly surrounding the collapse of former crypto exchange giant FTX. </span></li>
