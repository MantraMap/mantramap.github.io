<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought fresh technical guidance early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 30491.62 area, representing the 50% retracement of the appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair&rsquo;s recent depreciation to the 29417.14 area represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; The decline occurred after BTC/USD spiked higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and increased the possibility of a test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; BTC/USD notched a June gain of approximately 11.9%, and the pair is now up approximately 83.4% year-to-date.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
