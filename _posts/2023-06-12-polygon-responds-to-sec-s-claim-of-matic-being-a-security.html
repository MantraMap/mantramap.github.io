<p>Given our focus on network security, we made sure MATIC was available to a wide group of persons, but only with actions that did not target the US at any time.</p>

Market Takes a Dive
<p>In the days following the SEC&rsquo;s claims against Binance and rival exchange Coinbase, the overall crypto market appeared to hold firm.</p>
