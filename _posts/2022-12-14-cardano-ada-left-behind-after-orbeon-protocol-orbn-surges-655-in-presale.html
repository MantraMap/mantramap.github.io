<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has set new highs leaving behind Cardano (ADA) which has been dropping lately. </p>
<p>With stage 3 of the presale already underway, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) price has risen by over 655% in just a few weeks, while Cardano (ADA) continues to underperform. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few reasons for the fast growth of the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) while Cardano (ADA) stagnates. </p>

<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Surges by 655% in Presale</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol facilitates secure and transparent interactions between investors and emerging companies. Orbeon Protocol offers a number of safety measures, such as a "Fill or Kill," mechanism that make investing simple and risk-free. If a project doesn't raise enough money within the required amount of time, investors' money is returned.</p>
<p>The pre-sale for Orbeon Protocol has been quite successful. It is in phase 1 of its presale, and the price of ORBN tokens has increased by 655%. The growing popularity of the Orbeon Protocol can largely be attributed to its utility or use cases. </p>
<p>Thanks to Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), virtually anybody can now make seed investments in new businesses of their choice. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol facilitates this through the use of its NFT-as-a-Service (NFTaaS). The service creates equity-based fractionalized NFTs for companies that investors can buy at a low price. These NFTs are accessible to anybody and everyone who holds ORBN tokens for as little as $1.</p>
<p>This type of NFT-based investment paves the way for new entrants to enter the speculative venture capital industry without restrictions. It is making funding via non-traditional channels, such as venture capital (VC) and crowdsourcing, less cumbersome for the average investor. The new approach is also helping startups better engage with their communities in a Web3 environment. </p>
<p>In the presale phase, investors can purchase ORBN tokens at a discount and make profits later on. Market analysts predict a price increase of 6000%. Orbeon Protocol is definitely worth looking into as we head to 2023. </p>

<p>Cardano (ADA) </p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson, a controversial figure and co-creator of Ethereum, launched Cardano in 2015. </p>
<p>Cardano is a cryptocurrency that runs on the Cardano blockchain and enables its users to create tokens, develop and deploy dApps, and execute smart contracts. Cardano is well-prepared for operation, and its creators are dedicated to making it even better. </p>
<p>Cardano (ADA), the utility token for the platform, is a well-known crypto asset with a huge market capitalization. However, since the crypto winter hit, Cardano (ADA) has not been able to repeat its stellar performance of 2020. </p>
<p>This month alone has seen a huge decline in Cardano's value, and the cryptocurrency is now trading at a price that is 90% under its all-time peak of $3.09.</p>
<p>Cardano's ambitious goal of fostering a more autonomous and decentralized society has attracted a sizable online following. However, its performance lately has been anything but promising. </p>
<p>For Cardano investors, getting into the innovative technology that the Orbeon Protocol is introducing to the crowdfunding and VC industries is a double win. Orbeon, like Cardano, seeks to bring about change for those who have been excluded from the global financial system.</p>
