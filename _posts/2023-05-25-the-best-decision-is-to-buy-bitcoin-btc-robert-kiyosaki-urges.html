Renowned financial guru, entrepreneur, and bestselling author of &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad,&#8221; Robert Kiyosaki, has once again made headlines with his latest Twitter remarks on the importance of Bitcoin in the face of growing US debt. As the US economy continues to deteriorate and the country&#8217;s debt ceiling discussions take center stage, Kiyosaki emphasizes the urgency of securing one&#8217;s financial future by investing in alternative assets, including the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The State Of The US Economy  Robert Kiyosaki begins by shedding light on the deteriorating state of the US economy, expressing concern over the growing national debt. With Congress currently discussing raising the US debt ceiling to $31.4 trillion to avoid blemish, Kiyosaki dismisses it as nothing more than &#8220;kabuki theater.&#8221; Drawing attention to the dire financial situation, he asserts that the US is already bankrupt, citing unfunded liabilities, such as Social Security, which surpass $250 trillion.

Against this backdrop, he presents his solution: investing in tangible assets like gold, silver, and digital gold &#8211; Bitcoin. The Bestselling author of &#8220;Rich Dad Poor Dad&#8221; noted: Politicians debating raising $30 trillion US debt limit bad comedy, “kabuki theater.” Facts are: US [is] bankrupt. Unfunded liabilities [such] as Social Security are over $250 trillion. Financial market “derivative assets” [are] measured in quadrillions…thousands of trillions. WTF. Buy G,S, BC. Robert Kiyosaki has since been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, emphasizing the top crypto value for several years. During the onset of the pandemic in 2020, as the US government printed trillions of dollars to stimulate the economy, Kiyosaki voiced his concerns regarding the lack of backing and the inflationary risks associated with fiat currency. He famously referred to these newly printed dollars as &#8220;fake money,&#8221; warning of the consequences of such actions. With over $6 trillion already printed in 2020 alone, Kiyosaki anticipates that the ongoing printing spree will cause Bitcoin&#8217;s price to surge to approximately $500,000 by 2025. Bitcoin Downtrend Amid Buy Signal Meanwhile, despite the buy signal from Kiyosaki, Bitcoin has shown no uptick but instead a continuous decline. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a 1% decline, while the past seven days have seen a dip of 3.1%. At the time of writing, the top crypto currently trades at $26,412. Bitcoin&#8217;s trading volume has, however, surged in the past 7 days indicating a possible short-term downward pressure. The asset&#8217;s trading volume has spiked from a low of $15.3 billion last Thursday to a high of $17.6 billion in the past 24 hours.
