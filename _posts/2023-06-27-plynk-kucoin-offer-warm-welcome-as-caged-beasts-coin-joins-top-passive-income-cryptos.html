<p>Cryptocurrency is not merely about acquiring and holding altcoins; its potential for passive income cannot be overlooked. Picture yourself earning revenue effortlessly, without having to lift a finger. Moreover, crypto exchange platforms are upping the ante with their enticing welcome rewards. Among these are KuCoin and Plynk, but a newcomer is making waves: Caged Beasts Coin has joined the rank of Top passive income cryptos. Unlock the secrets of these offerings and maximise your profits.</p>
Plynk Has &ldquo;$50 For You&rdquo;
<p>Plynk is an SEC-regulated trading app designed for US investors. It provides a user-friendly platform where beginners can trade various instruments like stocks, fractional shares, mutual funds, and ETFs. In collaboration with Paxos Trust Co., Plynk introduced crypto trading in 2022. Users can trade and hold popular coins such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) through Paxos. Existing Plynk app users can apply for a crypto account offered by Paxos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Plynk is offering a $50 promotion. To qualify, open a new account on the app and link a bank account. You receive a $10 bonus just for signing up. When you&nbsp; deposit at least $25 within 15 calendar days of linking their eligible bank account,&nbsp; $50 will be credited to your account within 30 days of the Qualification Period, which starts when the bank account is linked.</p>
Avail KuCoin&rsquo;s New User Rewards
<p>The crypto exchange Kucoin offers great advantages such as high liquidity, low fees, and fast withdrawals. It was established in 2017 by Leon Kuensingh, who observed a shift of traders from Binance to Coinbase due to the recent ban on crypto trading on US exchanges.</p>
<p>New users who register on KuCoin can enjoy rewards of up to $100 USDT. These rewards are earned when users complete their first deposit or crypto purchase, make their first trade, and engage in pro trading. The rewards include USDT and valuable coupons, which can add up to a total worth of 3200 USDT. To receive these rewards, users need to fulfil the designated tasks within 60 days of signing up for their KuCoin account. It's important to note that each user can only receive each reward once.</p>
Caged Beasts&rsquo;s 20% USDT Commission
<p></p>
<p>Caged Beasts Coin (BEASTS) is no ordinary cryptocurrency. Aiming to overthrow the dominance of a privileged few and redistribute financial power to the masses, the BEASTS are out to start the DeFi Revolution and here&rsquo;s why they might just do it.</p>
<p>Community is at the heart of the BEASTS ecosystem. The referral scheme, for example, allows holders to bag a 20% USDT commission instantly. All you have to do is visit the website, select the 'Earn USDT' option, connect your wallet and generate a referral code to share. Each user can earn a generous 20% of any deposits made by their referrals, which is automatically added to their wallet. That&rsquo;s not all: the user who uses the referral code also receives a 20% share.</p>
<p>The token tells the tale of Rabbit 4001, who embarks on a quest to gather a group of rebels. During the token's presale journey, Rabbit 4001 bestows young animals with mutagens and cybernetic enhancements, symbolising the growth and accumulation of locked funds over time. The name itself, Caged Beasts, is a clever take on the concept of Caged Liquidity. The referral system aims to cultivate a united and expanding community that rewards its members, while the project as a whole thrives through active involvement and contributions from individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
The Takeaway
<p>With their respective welcome bonuses, KuCoin &amp; Plynk are top-notch platforms to consider for trading crypto. However, in the quest for the top passive income cryptos, Caged Beasts Coin emerges as a contender. Brace yourself for the imminent DeFi Revolution, spearheaded by none other than the mighty BEASTS.</p>
