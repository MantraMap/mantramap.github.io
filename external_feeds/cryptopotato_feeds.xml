			            <description><![CDATA[Two of the world’s leading market-making firms are getting cold feet on digital asset trading as America’s war on crypto intensifies.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto are pulling back from their crypto trading ambitions as U.S. regulators up their efforts to quash the industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, global trading firm Jane Street is scaling back crypto plans globally due to regulatory uncertainty. The clouded regulatory waters have “made it difficult for the firm to operate the business in a way that meets internal standards,” according to Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Jump Crypto, the digital assets unit of Jump Trading, is ditching the U.S. market for similar reasons, it <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/jane-street-jump-pull-back-crypto-trading-amid-us-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">added</a>.</p>
<h2>American Crypto Exodus</h2>
<p>However, Jump Crypto is expanding internationally, it was confirmed. Several U.S. crypto firms are also moving overseas, such as <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-stock-slides-as-exchanges-regulatory-woes-deepen/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a>, Gemini, and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mike-novogratz-galaxy-digital-turns-profitable-in-q1-2023-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">Galaxy Digital</a>.</p>
<p>Jane Street and Jump Trading were caught up in some of last year’s crypto market turmoil. They were targeted by U.S. prosecutors in an investigation into the failed Terra/Luna ecosystem. Additionally, Jump Crypto had been a major backer of the TerraUSD stablecoin project since 2019.</p>
<p>Jane Street has not escaped regulatory wrath either. According to the report, the company was cited anonymously by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in its lawsuit against Binance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried worked at Jane Street in New York before leaving to start Alameda in 2017.</p>
<p>The world’s leading crypto asset manager Grayscale is still pushing ahead with its crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) ambitions despite being stonewalled by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>On May 9, Grayscale <a href="https://pages.grayscale.com/index.php/email/emailWebview?md_id=3127" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">announced</a> the creation of the Grayscale Funds Trust, which it described as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A new Series Trust that will allow Grayscale to independently manage and bring to market new and innovative products, as we continue to build out our ETF franchise and broader product family.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It also filed a registration with the SEC for a Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, a Grayscale Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, and a Grayscale Privacy ETF.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets have remained flat over the past 24 hours. As a result, total capitalization remains at $1.19 trillion, following a 4.6% decline over the past week.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">BTC prices</a> were unmoved on the day at $27,694, while <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> remained unchanged at $1,845 at the time of writing.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; New York, United States, May 10th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.yesports.gg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Yesports</a>, the leading esports to web3 gaming platform, is thrilled to announce a special staking event for holders of the Pepe meme token. This 14-day extravaganza offers Pepe token holders the chance to stake and earn YESP rewards.</p>
<p>Beginning 11th of May, Pepe holders can stake their tokens and receive a share of 3m YESP, which will be distributed over 14 days. As part of the special offer event, Pepe holders can also participate in Yesports’ popular NFT prize games, which enable gamers and collectors to explore web3 games and provide engaging new ways to win exclusive NFTs.</p>
<p>Building strong communities is a central focus for businesses in both traditional gaming and web3. Given the speed at which blockchain technology advances and its ability to support the rapid growth of ardent communities, Yesports aims to expand its platform offerings further through this timely new event, activating utility for Pepe meme token holders.</p>
<p>Meme tokens serve to keep communities and audiences engaged through shared values, which are often represented by and translated through comical designs and themes. To date, the industry has seen very few meaningful examples of utility for meme tokens. The most notable can be backtracked to 2014 when Dogecoin holders sponsored NASCAR driver Josh Wise. For Yesports, this special event speaks to the sentiment of its web3 gaming community and its extended industry partners who share in the same vision and values.</p>
<p><span style="color: #767676; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic;">&#8220;Offering this staking event for Pepe token holders is something we believe to not only be fun, but necessary, some might even say inevitable,&#8221; says Sebastian Quinn, CEO of Yesports. &#8220;For a limited time, Pepe token holders can earn rewards while supporting the Yesports ecosystem, and Yesports can strengthen its community of avid gamers, esports organisations, fans and collectors.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>To participate in the staking event, Pepe token holders can visit the Yesports website and follow the instructions provided at <a href="https://yesports.gg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">yesports.gg</a>. For more information and FAQ about YESP, visit Yesports blog <a href="https://medium.com/@Yesports.gg/unlock-next-level-gaming-experiences-with-yesp-6c4129e0fd0a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">here</a> and get details about NFT prize games <a href="https://medium.com/@Yesports.gg/discover-new-games-and-win-nft-prizes-with-yesports-83ebb98eeb71" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">here</a>.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency trading is becoming more and more popular as the market matures and dives into the mainstream.</p>
<p>This is evident by the growing trading volume across the board over the past couple of years. The demand is increasing, and so new players emerge to attempt to provide a more streamlined user experience.</p>
<p>One such relatively new cryptocurrency exchange is BYDFi. The platform was launched in 2020 and is focused on delivering professional, convenient, and innovative cryptocurrency trading features.</p>
<p>From copy trading to derivatives trading, BYDFi offers a wide suite of options for both beginners and seasoned traders. The following is a complete overview and a guide on how to use the BYDFi exchange.</p>
<h2>How to Register on BYDFi</h2>
<p>Registering a new account on BYDFi is quite seamless. Once you go on the official website, you will find a button on the top right where you can <a href="https://www.bydfi.com/account/register?ru=KSMCBP&amp;f=media" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">register</a>.</p>
<p>This is the screen that you will get:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bydfi_1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249931" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bydfi_1.png" alt="" width="419" height="654" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bydfi_1.png 419w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bydfi_1-192x300.png 192w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bydfi_1-32x50.png 32w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure to enter a valid email address because you will need to verify it through a code immediately in order to register. Also, keep in mind that it might take a few moments to receive the code itself. If you fail to get it the first time, you can always request a new code in a minute.</p>
<p>Once you have your account created, the first thing you should do is go through all possible security measures.</p>
<p>From the Account Security tab, hit the Manage button under the security center and go through all of the steps, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone number verification</li>
<li>Email verification (this should already be done)</li>
<li>Google Authenticator</li>
<li>Fund password, and so forth</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also create a withdrawal address whitelist for additional security and only use those when you want to take funds out of your BYDFi account.</p>
<ul>
<li>KYC on BYDFi</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically, you can use the exchange without going through the Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure, but the limitations make it hard. If you want to strip these off, make sure to verify your identity &#8211; it’s a standard procedure that almost all legitimate exchanges require. It’s also relatively simple, and it’s just a few steps.</p>
<p>Once all of the above is done, you can start using the platform. Let’s first see how to deposit funds.</p>
<h2>How to Deposit and Withdraw on BYDFi</h2>
<p>If you’ve used any other cryptocurrency exchange before, you should have no issues with this particular step.</p>
<p>On the top navigation menu, you will find the Assets tab, and through the drop-down menu that you get after you hover over it, you should click on the Deposit button.</p>
<p>This is the screen that you will land on:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249932" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfi.jpg" alt="img2_bydfi" width="1215" height="688" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfi.jpg 1215w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfi-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfi-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfi-768x435.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfi-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1215px) 100vw, 1215px" /></a></p>
<p>From here, all you need to do is select the network that you want to use. Once you click on it, the platform will automatically generate a respective deposit address that you can use to send funds to.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note: always double-check the network you’re using. Sending funds through the wrong network or a wrong address can resolve in an irrecoverable loss of funds. </em></strong></p>
<p>As you can see, there’s no minimum deposit. Network fees apply here.</p>
<p>Once you have funds deposited, you need to transfer them to your respective sub-accounts, depending on whether you want to use the spot exchange, the derivatives exchange, or other products:</p>
<p>Once you have this sorted, it’s time to start trading.</p>
<h3>How to Trade on BYDFi (Spot)</h3>
<p>First things first, we will go through the spot trading platform, and after that, we will look at the derivatives.</p>
<p>BYDFi has an advanced version of their spot trading platform, but we will stick to the classic as that’s what the majority of the users are likely familiar with and comfortable with. This is what the interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img1_bydfi.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249933" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img1_bydfi.png" alt="img1_bydfi" width="1694" height="981" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img1_bydfi.png 1694w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img1_bydfi-300x174.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img1_bydfi-1024x593.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img1_bydfi-768x445.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img1_bydfi-1536x890.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img1_bydfi-50x29.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1694px) 100vw, 1694px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, it’s pretty standard. On the left side, there’re the different cryptocurrencies that are available, in the middle, there’s the chart, as well as the order types, and on the right, there’s the order book.</p>
<p>BYDFi supports a range of different cryptocurrencies on its spot platform, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>Ripple (XRP)</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA)</li>
<li>Polkadot (DOT), and many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two order types that you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit order &#8211; use this if you want to open a position at a specified price. This order is placed in the order book and executed as soon as the price reaches it, given there’s enough liquidity. Limit orders can be partially filled.</li>
<li>Market order &#8211; use this order if you want to open a position immediately at the best available price from the order book.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Open a Position</h3>
<p>For the sake of this guide, we will open a position using a simple market order, and it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img5_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249934" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img5_bydfi.jpg" alt="img5_bydfi" width="540" height="284" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img5_bydfi.jpg 540w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img5_bydfi-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img5_bydfi-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>As seen in the image, we want to buy BTC for 50 USDT. As soon as we hit the Buy BTC button, the order will be executed and we will have 50 USDT worth of BTC. At current prices, this got us exactly 0.0017 BTC.</p>
<h3>How to Close a Position</h3>
<p>If you want to close your position in a spot exchange, all you have to do is sell your crypto (in this case &#8211; BTC). Again, we will use a simple market order to do so:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img6_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249935" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img6_bydfi.jpg" alt="img6_bydfi" width="540" height="244" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img6_bydfi.jpg 540w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img6_bydfi-300x136.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img6_bydfi-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the 50 USDT bought us 0.0017 BTC, and if we want to close the position, all we have to do is sell all of it. Please note that you can also partially close it and only sell a portion of your holdings.</p>
<p>That’s all there is to trading on the spot platform. Using the limit orders is also very simple, as the only difference is that you input a specified price, and you have to hope for the market to reach it and fill it.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see how to use the derivatives platform.</p>
<h2>How to Trade on BYDFi (Derivatives)</h2>
<p>As you will notice when hovering over the derivatives button on the main navigation menu, you get a few options:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img7_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249936" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img7_bydfi.jpg" alt="img7_bydfi" width="609" height="525" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img7_bydfi.jpg 609w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img7_bydfi-300x259.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img7_bydfi-50x43.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px" /></a></p>
<p>USDT-M allows you to trade perpetual contracts denominated in USDT. COIN-M provides perpetual contracts settled in crypto, while lite contracts are simplified, and leveraged tokens provide other opportunities. In this guide, we will focus on the USDT-M option.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to note that a perpetual contract is a futures contract with no expiration or settlement date. This means you can buy and sell it whenever you want to, making it quite versatile.</p>
<p>Derivatives trading also enables the usage of leverage, making the entire thing a lot riskier. It carries a massive risk of capital loss, so it should only be practiced by experienced users. Using leverage of above 5x is extremely risky and should be practiced with heightened caution.</p>
<p>This is what the derivatives trading interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfii.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249938" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfii.png" alt="img2_bydfii" width="1698" height="1112" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfii.png 1698w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfii-300x196.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfii-1024x671.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfii-768x503.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfii-1536x1006.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img2_bydfii-50x33.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1698px) 100vw, 1698px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, there are a few differences, particularly in the right part of the screen, where you’re now able to use more order types and adjust your leverage.</p>
<p>For their BTC trading pair, BYDFi has the option to use as much as 150x leverage, but we will only use 5x, for the reasons explained above.</p>
<p>The way leverage works is that it amplifies your position size by the factor of your leverage. So 5x means you open a 5 times greater position using the same capital. For example, you can use $10 to open a $50 position.</p>
<p>However, the catch is that if the price starts moving against you in a way that you lose your initial capital (also known as margin), you get liquidated. So, in the above example, if the price moves against you and you lose $10, your entire position will get liquidated. In the case of using 5x leverage, the price needs to move 20% against you. The higher the leverage, the lower this percentage and the more riskier your trade is.</p>
<h3>How to Open a Position</h3>
<p>Following our previous example, we will use a simple market order to open a position:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img9_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249939" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img9_bydfi.jpg" alt="img9_bydfi" width="289" height="671" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img9_bydfi.jpg 289w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img9_bydfi-129x300.jpg 129w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img9_bydfi-22x50.jpg 22w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /></a></p>
<p>As soon as we hit the Long button, we will be buying BTC worth 100 USDT but only postin 17.61 USDT as collateral because of the leverage that we use.</p>
<p>Please note that with derivatives, you can also bet on the price going down. To do so, you have to hit the red Short button, and your position will yield a profit if the price declines.</p>
<h3>How to Close a Position</h3>
<p>Right below the chart, you will find the tab where you can manage your positions:</p>
<p>Here, you can monitor your size, margin mode, entry price, liquidation price, margin ratio, as well as your PNL. To close your position, simply hit the market button on the side or place a limit order with the desired exit price.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img10_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249940" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img10_bydfi.jpg" alt="img10_bydfi" width="1403" height="179" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img10_bydfi.jpg 1403w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img10_bydfi-300x38.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img10_bydfi-1024x131.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img10_bydfi-768x98.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img10_bydfi-50x6.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1403px) 100vw, 1403px" /></a></p>
<h3>Stop Loss/Take Profit Orders</h3>
<p>In addition to the above, you can also use a stop-loss or take-profit orders so that you don’t have to close your position manually. To do so, hit the stop limit button and select an order type.</p>
<p>The Stop Limit itself looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img11_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249941" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img11_bydfi.jpg" alt="img11_bydfi" width="297" height="629" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img11_bydfi.jpg 297w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img11_bydfi-142x300.jpg 142w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img11_bydfi-24x50.jpg 24w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></a></p>
<h2>Copy Trading on BYDFi</h2>
<p>Copy trading is a type of social trading where you will automatically follow the trades of other people. While this can be profitable, it’s important to keep close tabs on your positions and make sure to follow them closely because there are multiple factors that you have to account for.</p>
<p>In any case, this is what the dashboard of the best-performing traders looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img12_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249942" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img12_bydfi.jpg" alt="img12_bydfi" width="885" height="986" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img12_bydfi.jpg 885w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img12_bydfi-269x300.jpg 269w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img12_bydfi-768x856.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img12_bydfi-45x50.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /></a></p>
<p>From here, if you want to copy someone, you have to hit the Copy button and input the specifications that most suit your trading style:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img13_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249943" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img13_bydfi.jpg" alt="img13_bydfi" width="469" height="517" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img13_bydfi.jpg 469w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img13_bydfi-272x300.jpg 272w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img13_bydfi-45x50.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /></a></p>
<h2>What are Fees on BYDFi</h2>
<p>As with any other cryptocurrency exchange, there are fees associated with opening and closing positions.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://support.bydfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/5699103361551-Transaction-Fee-Calculation" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">official page</a>, this is how the spot trading fees are calculated:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img14_bydfi.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-249944" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img14_bydfi.jpg" alt="img14_bydfi" width="697" height="145" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img14_bydfi.jpg 697w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img14_bydfi-300x62.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img14_bydfi-50x10.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /></a></p>
<p>For the derivatives, the fees differ based on the platform that you decide to use, so it’s highly advisable to take a look at the page and make sure you keep these in mind.</p>
<h2>Security: Is BYDFi Safe?</h2>
<p>There are no reports of BYDFi being compromised. The website provides a range of different security measures that users can implement to make sure that their account is protected.</p>
<p>Of course, there are always risks associated with keeping funds on any centralized exchange, so you should only keep what you use for trading.</p>
<h2>BYDFi Customer Support</h2>
<p>BYDFi has a live customer support service. To test it, we send a random inquiry, and after requesting to speak to a member of the team, someone contacted us almost immediately.</p>
<p>The responses were very quick and adequate, and the person helped us with the imaginary issue with the expected adequacy.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all, BYDFi seems like a comprehensive cryptocurrency exchange with a large suite of  tools that some of its competitors fail to provide.</p>
<p>The exchange supports all the major trading pairs, and there’s no lack of choice.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multiple additional features for beginners and advanced traders</li>
<li>Comprehensive and easy-to-use interface</li>
<li>Very quick customer support</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>There’s no phone customer support</li>
<li>Liquidity is rather thin at the time of this review</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Online payments giant PayPal held nearly $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency on its balance sheet by the end of Q1 2023, according to a 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Customers Crypto in the Green</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001633917/000163391723000072/pypl-20230331.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, dated for the quarterly period ending March 31 2023, showed that PayPal held $943 million worth of customers’ Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC) on its balance sheet as of that time. None of its crypto belongs to anyone other than its customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s a $339 million increase in customer crypto assets from the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-owned-604-million-in-crypto-last-year/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">previous quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, representing a 56% rise. This is largely in line with Bitcoin’s 72% rise during that time, from $16,547 on December 31 to $28,478 on March 31.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The company’s current crypto breakdown consists of $499 million worth of BTC, $362 million in ETH, and the other $82 million in BCH and LTC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PayPal explained in its 10-Q that it lets customers buy, sell, receive, send, and hold said cryptocurrencies, and use the proceeds from their respective sales to purchase goods and services at checkout. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We maintain the internal recordkeeping of our customers’ crypto assets, including the amount and type of crypto asset owned by each of our customers,” PayPal said in the filing.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PayPal also said that it will fully protect customers from unauthorized crypto purchases or sales, and from unauthorized crypto transfers up to $50,000 lifetime. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">PayPal&#8217;s Crypto Support<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said he was “bullish on cryptocurrencies of all kinds” during a web summit event in 2020, after admitting that he </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hodler-paypal-ceo-dan-schulman-admits-that-he-owns-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">personally owned Bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In March 2022, he added that CBDCs, stablecoins, and digital wallets will “redefine a lot of the financial world going forward.”</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Please Read Disclaimer]</strong></p>
<p>TiTi Protocol announced that it will launch the Ethereum mainnet in the next few weeks and plans to start IDO and 2nd round airdrops. TiTi Protocol plans to start IDO on May 10, and users can visit <a href="https://ido.titi.finance" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://ido.titi.finance</a> to participate in IDO. IDO participating users will receive exclusive NFT and will be eligible for airdrops and other benefits in the future.</p>
<h2>What is TiTi Protocol？</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TiTiProtocol/status/1655524820250152962?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TiTi Protocol</a> is a fully collateralized, multi-asset reserve, bankrun resistant, use-to-earn decentralized stablecoin. With its new paradigm, TiTi Protocol becomes the first stablecoin that adopts &#8220;Use-to-Earn&#8221; and prevents bank-run inherently. TiUSD is the stablecoin issued by the TiTi protocol, whileTiTi is the protocol&#8217;s governance token.</p>
<p>Previously, TiTi Protocol announced in April 2022 that it had completed a financing of US$3.5 million led by The Spartan Group, with participation from SevenX Ventures, Incuba Alpha, DeFi Alliance, Agnostic Fund, Fourth Revolution Capital (4RCapital), Solidity Venture, and other institutions, as well as other individual investors including 0xb1 (Fold Finance), Tascha and Nipun (Alpha Venture DAO), and Michael (Fantom).</p>
<p>In addition, TiTi Protocol has completed a 3-rounds smart contract Audit by Slowmist, Hacken and Peckshield.</p>
<h2>TiTi Protocol Mainnet &amp; Airdrop &amp; IDO</h2>
<p>TiTi Protocol will launch on the Ethereum mainnet in the next few weeks. Users can use and trade TiUSD to passively or actively earn protocol fees.</p>
<p>After the TiTi mainnet goes live, TiTi Protocol will inject a large amount of TiTi into the mainnet. Users can earn TiTi through yield farming, especially the original unilateral liquidity MMF function created by TiTi Protocol. Users only need to provide unilateral liquidity to earn TiTi. It&#8217;s free of risk and with a rather profitable APY! And in order to give back to early users, early TiTi rewards are very generous!</p>
<p>TiTi Protocol just completed the first round of airdrops a few weeks ago, and plans to start the second round of airdrops after the mainnet goes live.</p>
<p>In addition, TiTi Protocol will kick off IDO on May 10. This IDO provides a total of 10,000,000 TiTi tokens at a price of $0.06.</p>
<h2>About TiTi Protocol</h2>
<p>TiTi Protocol is a decentralized, 100% collateral-backed, crypto-native stablecoin, aiming to provide diversified and decentralized financial services based on the crypto-native stablecoin system and autonomous monetary policy.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase’s former Product Manager Ishan Wahi will serve a sentence more than twice as long as his brother and co-conspirator, Nikhil Wahi. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After pleading guilty earlier this year, former Coinbase Product Manager Ishan Wahi has been sentenced to 2 years in prison in a landmark case for insider trading with cryptocurrencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sentence exceeds the 10-month prison sentence of Ishan’s brother – Nikhil Wahi – with whom he conspired for the crime. </span></p>
<h2>Two Years for Crypto Insider Trading</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to a report from </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/coinbase-ex-manager-sentenced-2-years-prison-us-insider-trading-case-2023-05-09/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Ishan Wahi was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in a Manhattan Federal court on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sentence follows a guilty plea from Wahi back in February to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Preska stated that his scheme was a “massive abuse” of Coinbase’s trust – America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange which has been subject to a plethora of customer and government-launched lawsuits over the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wahi was arrested and charged by the Department of Justice last July for having tipped his brother – alongside his friend Sameer Ramani – with information about upcoming coin listings at Coinbase that had not yet been made public. Analysis has shown that listings on large crypto exchanges often have a </span><a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/analysis-a-binance-listing-adds-41-on-crypto-prices-2f6cd72e8dff#:~:text=In%20most%20cases%2C%20a%20Binance,varies%20from%20project%20to%20project." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">dramatic effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on an asset’s price </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The group’s scheme netted them roughly $1.5 million in total across 55 different token announcements between June 2021 and April 2022, according to prosecutors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Assistant U.S. Attorney Noah Solowiejczyk said during the hearing that the ten months of consistent tips demonstrated that Wahi’s actions were “not a one-off mistake.” Meanwhile, Judge Preska added that Wahi and the co-defendants’ attempts at covering their actions proved that they knew what they were doing was wrong. </span></p>
<h2>A “Huge Mistake”</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I made a huge mistake that will follow me for the rest of my life,&#8221; Wahi said. His comment echoed that of his brother Nikhil from back in January, who said his mistake was “something that I will have to live with forever,” after </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/brother-of-former-coinbase-manager-sentenced-to-10-months-in-prison/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">pleading guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to his respective charges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ishan Wahi initially </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ex-coinbase-executive-pleads-not-guilty-to-insider-trading-case-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">pled not guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to wire fraud charges shortly after they were announced, but eventually followed his brother’s lead with a </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-coinbase-exec-pleads-guilty-to-insider-trading-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">guilty plea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in February. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wahi requested a sentence no longer than his brother’s within court papers, citing other insider trading cases where lawbreakers were little prison time. On the other hand, prosecutors called for Wahi to receive 3 years in prison to set an example for other crypto exchange insiders misusing their privileged information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OpenSea’s Head of Product was similarly charged with NFT Insider Trading in June – but the ex-employee has since </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/openseas-former-head-of-product-files-motion-to-drop-insider-trading-charges/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to have those charges dropped. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase's Paul Grewal has criticized SEC's RIA custody rule for unfairly singling out crypto.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase has called for certain modifications to the proposed rule regarding registered investment advisers&#8217; (RIA) obligations to hold client assets at qualified custodians.</p>
<p>Even as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deemed Coinbase Custody as a &#8220;qualified custodian,&#8221; the crypto exchange believes the revised RIA rule makes &#8220;unwarranted assumptions about custodial practice.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Revisions Needed</h2>
<p>The chief legal officer of the San Francisco-based company, Paul Grewal, believes the proposal titled &#8216;Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Proposed Rule 223-1&#8217; is &#8220;misguided.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a new letter to the securities watchdog, Grewal highlighted the need to make several revisions. He also said that certain assumptions made on the proposal are unnecessary and inappropriate and could prove &#8220;detrimental&#8221; to consumer protection for various asset classes, including crypto, &#8220;whether or not they are securities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/2fyFy6G9j96hN6putNvZMQ/9118ca626f70bef899c25922d04d3c24/QC_Proposal_Comment_Letter_-_Submission_Version.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">letter</a> advocated that the SEC should continue to define state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions as &#8220;qualified custodians.&#8221; Grewal also proposes enabling limited exposure to non-qualified custodians and withdrawing the ban on RIA client trades on crypto exchanges, which are not qualified custodians.</p>
<p>The exec further pointed out that &#8220;the SEC&#8217;s rule should tailor standards of care by asset class and client type&#8221; while simultaneously allowing sophisticated clients to negotiate their own contracts.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We appreciate the chance to weigh in and we look forward to engaging with the SEC to get this right – public rulemaking is a critical step in bringing further clarity to the market.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Coinbase vs SEC: Regulatory Tussle</h2>
<p>Coinbase has been under <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-ordered-10-days-to-file-response-to-coinbases-petition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">tremendous</a> regulatory scrutiny in the country lately. The SEC had also served the crypto exchange with a Wells Notice officially bringing an enforcement action against the exchange. While the company&#8217;s CEO, Brian Armstrong, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-is-100-committed-to-the-us-despite-regulatory-uncertainty-brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">confirmed</a> that there are no plans to relocate overseas, he also stressed that Europe has been &#8220;incredibly welcoming&#8221; on the regulatory front.</p>
<p>With the US failing to deliver regulatory clarity, Coinbase has ramped up international expansion. It recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-officially-launches-platform-for-non-us-institutional-investors-in-bermuda-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> Coinbase International Exchange, a Bermuda-based crypto derivatives platform for non-US institutional clients.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[O'Neal's lawyers supposedly said the official notice was "tossed" at his moving car and not served at his home.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawyers of the American basketball legend &#8211; Shaquille O&#8217;Neal &#8211; reportedly asked a federal court to block a recent summons served regarding his interaction with FTX. They claimed the documents were &#8220;tossed&#8221; at the front of his moving car: an entirely different version than the one presented by attorney Adam M. Moskowitz who supposedly served the sportsman in his home.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Failed investors have claimed that O&#8217;Neal and many other celebrities used their popularity to promote the now-bankrupt exchange, triggering severe losses to inexperienced clients. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8216;Inadequate&#8217; Summons or Twisting the Facts?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/shaquille-o-neal-seeks-to-quash-ftx-suit-summons-as-inadequate-1.1917509" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Bloomberg, the attorneys of the former NBA star argued that the papers notifying a presence in court were &#8220;tossed&#8221; at O&#8217;Neal&#8217;s moving vehicle, and eventually, they &#8220;landed&#8221; on the road. As such, they requested a dismissal of the legal process against him, labeling the summons &#8220;inadequate.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The assertion disassociates with Adam Moskowitz&#8217;s thesis. The lawyer leading the lawsuit against O&#8217;Neal <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nba-legend-shaquille-oneal-served-in-ftx-class-action/" data-wpel-link="internal">said</a> he served the athlete at his home in mid-April. He also claimed the whole process happened in front of security cameras:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The good news is his home video cameras recorded our service, and we have made it very clear he is not to destroy and/or erase any of these security tapes because they must be preserved for our lawsuit.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The class-action lawsuit does not include only the basketball legend. Failed investors at FTX also blamed Tom Brady, Naomi Osaka, Steph Curry, and many other celebrities for endorsing the once-prominent crypto giant, thus prompting investor losses when the platform <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">crashed</a>. </span></p>

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;A lot of people think I&#8217;m involved, but I was just a paid spokesperson for a commercial.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Situation With Steph Curry and Tom Brady </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stephen Curry &#8211; one of the current NBA stars &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/basketball-superstar-stephen-curry-joins-ftx-as-ambassador-and-shareholder/" data-wpel-link="internal">inked</a> a deal with FTX in September 2021. Following the partnership, the 35-year-old American received an equity stake in the company and became its global ambassador. Like O&#8217;Neal, he starred in a commercial displaying FTX as a safe cryptocurrency platform. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Texas State Securities Board </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://basketnews.com/news-182077-stephen-curry-investigated-for-promoting-ftx.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">launched</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> an investigation against Curry to determine the impact of his actions on unfortunate investors.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[After closing shop amid regulatory hurdles and internal conflict, the Paxful markerplace is back to serving its customers.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Popular peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace Paxful is back online after shutting down services in April 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the platform was suspended, the Paxful Wallet remained active.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Paxful, in a <a href="https://paxful.com/sign-up-transition" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog post</a> on May 8, announced the resumption of the marketplace a month after the platform closed down. An excerpt from the announcement reads:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We know it has been a difficult time for many of our users, who were understandably surprised by the sudden suspension, however, we are delighted to be back so that we can continue to serve millions of people without financial access.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">As previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paxful-p2p-marketplace-closes-down-amid-multiple-executive-departures/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> by <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the Bitcoin P2P marketplace shut down in April 2023 while the wallet remained operational. Before the platform&#8217;s troubles came to light, Paxful was one of the most prominent P2P marketplaces in the industry, with over six million users globally.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Paxful co-founder and former CEO Ray Youssef mentioned regulatory hurdles for the P2P market as part of the reason for the marketplace shutdown.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Youssef also cited key staff departures, adding that a legal tussle between him and another co-founder Artur Schaback further contributed to the forced closed down of the company. Youssef described Schaback&#8217;s litigation as &#8220;nasty,&#8221; stating that the executive sued both the former CEO and the company because he was upset.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Shortly after Paxful&#8217;s suspension, Youssef said he was working towards <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paxful-co-founder-will-repay-users-with-his-own-money-doesnt-wanna-go-to-jail/" data-wpel-link="internal">refunding</a> customers from his pocket to avoid jail time.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Before the revival of the marketplace, Paxful was able to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paxful-co-founder-says-88-of-customer-accounts-have-been-unfrozen/" data-wpel-link="internal">unfreeze</a> 88% of customers&#8217; accounts, leaving 3% still frozen.</li>
<li dir="ltr">On April 18, the CEO announced his <a href="https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/1648283151410577409?t=z_golYXYeHaJcX7wLAndfQ&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">resignation</a> from the top position.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The company recorded $288 million losses in the previous quarter, amid a series of industry scandals and bankruptcies in addition to severe market slump.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Galaxy Digital turned profitable in the first quarter of the year as the markets improved. Its founder and CEO, Michael Novogratz, revealed that the crypto financial services firm ended Q1 2023 with a liquidity position of $814 million.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to an official <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/galaxy-announces-first-quarter-2023-financial-results-882794769.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">press release</a>, Galaxy Digital reported $134 million in net income for the same period as compared to a net loss of $288 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The income was attributed to the gains on digital assets as well as unrealized gains on investments.</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s asset management division &#8211; Galaxy Digital Asset Management (GAM) &#8211; registered assets under management of $2.4 billion, representing an increase of 40% from the previous quarter.</li>
<li>On the mining front as well, Galaxy Digital Infrastructure Solutions (GDIS) concluded the quarter with nearly 3.0 exahash per second in Hashrate Under Management (HUM), surging by more than 100% increase QoQ.</li>
<li>Commenting on the first quarter earnings call, Novogratz said,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Galaxy&#8217;s globally diversified platform and longstanding commitment to promoting the responsible adoption of digital assets is resonating with clients more than ever before. Our first quarter 2023 results are a validation of the investments we have made in our business to drive long-term growth and lead the evolution of the digital asset industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The New York-based company had been posting negative quarterly revenues since the end of 2021. With the subsequent crypto price slump, Galaxy Digital resorted to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/michael-novogratzs-galaxy-digital-plans-to-reduce-headcount-by-20-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">slashing</a> its headcount by 20%.</li>
<li>Its losses were <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/galaxy-digital-held-77-million-in-ftx-exposure-earnings-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">exacerbated</a> after the FTX collapse as it held over $76 million worth of exposure to bankrupt exchange.</li>
<li>Amidst heightened regulatory scrutiny, Novogratz revealed the company&#8217;s intention to expand its operations offshore.</li>
