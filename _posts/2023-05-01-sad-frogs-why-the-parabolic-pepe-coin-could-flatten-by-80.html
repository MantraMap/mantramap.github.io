Read This Before Buying Few meme coins these days are a bigger deal than Pepe, rising from nothing to into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap in a little over two weeks since its launch. It&#8217;s vastly out-performed meme coin brethren Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, and the dozens of new coins that Pepe&#8217;s runaway success has spawned.

A rule of thumb in technical analysis is to expect at minimum an 80% retracement of a parabolic rally. Crypto holders would do well to remember that Peter Brandt famously called for an 80% collapse in Bitcoin after the 2017 peak. After that parabolic rally ended, BTCUSD dropped at full 84% from top to bottom before it was over. Brandt nailed the target over a year in advance.

But much like Bitcoin then, after the correction, Pepe coin being such a new and hot coin should eventually bring substantial returns again. However, while the greater crypto market corrects, profit taking could aggressively spill into Pepe holders, who have a lot more room to fall compared to the rest of the market. As a result, things could get ugly quickly.
