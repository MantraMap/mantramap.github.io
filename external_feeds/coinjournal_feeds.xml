<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies dipped sharply as bond yields surged.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Most coins attempted to bounce back, in what could be a dead cat bounce.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies stabilized on Saturday after going through one of their worst performance in the past few months. After consolidating at $29,000 for weeks,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-price-forecast-wolfe-research-analyst/"><u>Bitcoin plunged to $25,000</u></a>. Sei, one of the newest tokens, plunged by over 80% from its all-time high. This article will look at some of the top-performing tokens like THORChain, Bitcoin SV, and Akash Network.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Akash Network price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Akash Network&rsquo;s AKT did not go through a major meltdown this week. On the daily chart, we see that the token rose to a high of $1.5580, the highest level since April last year. The token has moved above the 50-day and 25-day moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above the overbought level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Akash Network has also flipped the important resistance level at $0.7462 into a support. This was an important level since it was the highest point on June 1st and July 4th. Now, the token has formed what looks like a double-top pattern whose neckline was at $1.1077. In most periods, a double-top pattern is usually a bearish sign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, Akash Network price will likely retreat in the coming days as buyers start to take profit. If this happens, the next level to watch will be the psychological level at $1.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/19/1692423556907-38e099cf-dcdd-4b81-a4e0-b0f7617b1841.png" style="width: 601px;height: 292.487px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="601" height="292.487"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">THORChain price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/thorchain/"><u>THORChain</u></a>&rsquo;s RUNE price has made a bullish breakout in the past few weeks. In this period, it has jumped from $0.9170 to a high of $1.60. It has flipped the important resistance point at $1.110, the highest point on July 3rd.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like Akash Network, the token has jumped above all moving averages and is about to form a golden cross pattern. This pattern usually forms when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages make a bullish crossover.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator have moved above the overbought levels. The outlook for the RUNE price is bullish, with the next level to watch being at $2.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/19/1692423556700-9b8ac23a-02fb-4f25-81a0-428bb2880540.png" style="width: 593px;height: 288.522px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="593" height="288.522"></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin SV price forecast</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin-sv/"><u>Bitcoin SV</u></a> price was not left behind in this week&rsquo;s crypto crash. This move was expected since BSV has a close correlation with BTC. As it dropped, the coin dropped below the important support at $34.33, the lowest level on July 27th.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">BSV has also slipped below the 25-day and 50-day moving averages. It has now rebounded and flipped the resistance at $29, the lowest point on May 8th. This rebound seems like a dead cat bounce, signaling that the coin will likely resume the bearish trend in the coming days. If this happens, the next level to watch will be at $25.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Litecoin price has retreated 14% in the past 24 hours and 23% in the past week</li>
<li dir="ltr">Price has also broken below an ascending channel trendline support.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Can bulls stem post-halving dump?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/litecoin/">Litecoin</a> price has declined 14% in the past 24 hours to add to the pain bulls have experienced over the past three weeks. The cryptocurrency, which successfully underwent its third block reward halving early this month, traded to lows of $60.75 and has plummeted 23% in the past week.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why did Litecoin price go down today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">LTC&rsquo;s latest price decline came as most top cryptocurrencies by market cap dumped heavily on the back of Bitcoin&rsquo;s sharp plunge to the $25k area. &nbsp;This was after investors spooked by rumours related to Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX BTC holdings sold off, with the 24-hour <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-liquidations-hit-1b-as-bitcoin-dumps-to-near-25k/">crypto liquidations jumping to over $1 billion on Friday</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The downward pressure cascaded to altcoins, which saw Ethereum nosedive to below $1,575 and XRP touch the technical support area of $0.50. Litecoin&rsquo;s reaction was for its post-halving rot to deepen and leave bulls poised at a key level that threatens further declines.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">LTC price technical outlook</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As seen on the daily chart below, the breakdown from highs of $114 in early July has all but wiped pre-halving gains. The psychologically important $100 is once again the primary horizontal resistance level while $60 is now crucial for bulls.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 700px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/18/1692384356029-9aa12a65-ec57-495b-b30a-3ac181b32417.png" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="267"><span class="fr-inner">Litecoin price on daily chart. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/7a7c0B2x/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TradingView</a></span></p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">The weekly chart also gives a bearish outlook, with the RSI indicator signaling negative momentum. The chart also shows that LTC has broken below the support line of an ascending parallel channel in place since mid-May 2022. The decisive breakdown suggests bears have the upper hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 700px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/18/1692384235773-c36d36de-309b-4edb-b0a7-2636e75b14e9.png" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="267"><span class="fr-inner">Litecoin price on weekly chart. Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/AkBG7ay0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TradingView</a></span></p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">If the price breaks down from $60, Litecoin risks new declines of 30% or more to $40. While a rebound could materialize in the short term, bulls will remain under pressure unless price strengthens in the $80-$100 region.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Credit card processor Checkout.com cuts ties with Binance over AML concerns.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Binance is reportedly considering legal action, Forbes said in a report published August 18.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Binance recently announced it was shutting down its regulated buy-and-sell crypto arm Binance Connect.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Checkout.com, the UK-based payments processor that has been one of the biggest payments partners for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/binance/">Binance</a>, has reportedly ended its relationship with the crypto exchange giant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2023/08/18/payment-processor-checkout-drops-binance-over-money-laundering-compliance-concerns/?sh=70ec64fd5623" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published</u></a> by Forbes on August 18 indicated that the London-based firm informed Binance of the move this week, having sent letters to that effect on August 9 and 11. In the letters, Checkout.com cites the various regulatory actions against the crypto company and overall concerns over anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The termination, which took effect on August 17, was communicated to Binance by Checkout CEO Guillaume Pousaz, Forbes reported.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance is considering legal action following Checkout&rsquo;s decision, the exchange said via a statement attributed to spokesperson Dewi Mustajab. The crypto giant says the withdrawal by Checkout.com will not impact its services.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Binance recently shut Binance Connect</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The development comes shortly after Binance, as CoinJournal&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/regulated-buy-and-sell-arm-of-binance-binance-connect-shutting-down/"><u>reported</u></a> earlier this week, announced it was shutting down a Checkout-supported unit dubbed Binance Connect. The regulated buy-and-sell platform supported crypto payments for businesses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, PaySafe, one of Europe&rsquo;s leading payments providers, also ended its partnership with Binance in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-launches-payments-technology-company-bifinity-421499824684903541" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> its fiat-to-crypto payments provider, Bifinity, in March 2022. The company was unveiled in partnership with both PaySafe and Checkout.com.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Shiba Inu (SHIB) traded to lows of $0.0000072 before bouncing to $0.0000087.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Declines for SHIB came amid wider crypto sell-off as Bitcoin fell to lows of $25,600.</li>
<li dir="ltr">SHIB price could recover to the psychological $0.00001 or see fresh declines to major support levels.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu</a>&rsquo;s native token SHIB has plunged to July lows, trading to lows of $0.000000726 after a sharp 20% drop. SHIB price was down over 30% in the past week as of 8:30 am ET on Friday morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token&rsquo;s sharp decline follows a broader market sell-off that also saw <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-on-knifes-edge-as-price-falls-below-28k/">Bitcoin flash crash</a> to $25,600 and Ethereum to $1,570. However, for Shiba Inu, the dump had another catalyst.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sell-off came at a time the SHIB army &ndash; a passionate community of SHIB holders &ndash; was looking to navigate a major setback related to the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s layer-2 network Shibarium. Meanwhile, the data <a href="https://twitter.com/shibburn/status/1692521781804892312" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shows</a> a total of over 97 million SHIB have been burnt in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shibarium hit snag shortly after launch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shibarium, a fork of Polygon, launched to much hype on Wednesday, with the community celebrating a key milestone as the layer-2 network brought new functionality set to transform the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But that enthusiasm hit the rocks shortly after, with the L2 going offline amid what the team says was an unprecedented traffic. The <a href="https://blog.shib.io/shibarium-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest update</a> from the team has nonetheless provided optimism for a swift reboot, more so after it was revealed Shibarium was getting help from major players within the ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Developer Kaal Dhairya has also assured users that the $1.7 million in user funds locked in the ETH bridge as the blockchain went into &ldquo;fail safe&rdquo; mode were &ldquo;safu.&rdquo; Although its unclear when the Shiba Inu L2 platform reboots, the community&rsquo;s response to today&rsquo;s update has seen SHIB price turn just green as seen on the 24-hour time frame.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SHIB price outlook after Shibarium setback</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The 4-hour chart below shows SHIB has bounced from lows of $0.00000726 to intraday highs of $0.0000087.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 700px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/18/1692364594159-304af432-bb81-4519-b25e-c97e5a148dc2.png" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="267"><span class="fr-inner">Shiba Inu price on 4-hour chart. Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/z2fPES8u/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TradingView</a></span></p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">This area however represents a previous resistance zone, which suggests the SHIB army might have to dig in push further to bounce to the psychologically important $0.00001 level.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Otherwise, more downside will follow as the 4-hour RSI remains below 50 to indicate strength still lies with the bears. In this case, the key areas to watch on the downside are $0.000008 and $0.0000075.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Over $1 billion in crypto liquidations occured as crypto prices dumped sharply.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin fell to near $25k amid a flash crash triggered by SpaceX rumour.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto market saw a sharp correction overnight Thursday/Friday morning, with <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> crashing within minutes from near $28k to lows of $25,600. Reverberations across the market resulted in over $1 billion in liquidations and the crypto market cap shrunk by nearly 7%.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Traders rekt as amid massive $1 billion in liquidations</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Even though the benchmark cryptocurrency has pared some of the losses to trade around $26,440 at 7am ET, the negative flip left more than 176,000 traders rekt. According to data from <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Coinglass</a>, the past 24 hours saw 176,700 traders liquidated &ndash; total liquidations in the time frame reaching $1.04 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most of the liquidated positions were longs at $832 million, while shorts accounted for about $206 million. Bitcoin saw over $499 million in liquidations &ndash; $373 million in longs and $125 million in shorts.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Glassnode data, the largest single liquidation order was $55.92 million on Binance and involved ETH/BUSD. The ETH price fell to below $1,580, its lowest level since mid-June. Wu Blockchain posted <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1692496102216655289" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> on X.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">During today&rsquo;s sharp drop, an investor in Binance&rsquo;s ETHBUSD contract was liquidated at $1,434.37 for $55.9211 million, which was the largest liquidation order today. This could be a market maker, which may hedge on other exchanges. In the same minute, a Binance BTCUSDT contract&hellip;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why did Bitcoin price fall so suddenly?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-on-knifes-edge-as-price-falls-below-28k/">Bitcoin teetered on a knife&rsquo;s edge</a> on Thursday when crypto mirrored broader market&rsquo;s reaction to Fed minutes released on Wednesday. After breaking below $28k, largely on scant volume, the possibility of a flash crash increased.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That happened after rumours spread that Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX had dumped its BTC holdings. By the time the rumour was debunked, BTC/USD was trading at levels last seen when the market reacted higher on news of BlackRock&rsquo;s spot <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin-etf/">Bitcoin ETF</a> application.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Veteran trader and analyst Gareth Soloway highlighted the outlook via a post on X.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> flushed through 28k. With so little volume, stops triggering can cause an outsized move (flash crash).</p>
<p>Rumors that SpaceX dumped its holdings (unconfirmed) exacerbated the selling and increased the dump with so few buyers available. SpaceX did write down some of their&hellip; <a href="https://t.co/eN6QErapWc">pic.twitter.com/eN6QErapWc</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">The recovery towards the critical $28k level is likely to hinge on regulatory news involving the Grayscale ETF application, which is expected today around 11 am ET. Still on ETF news, there&rsquo;s some optimism related to the approval of several Ether futures ETF applications. These and other market conditions could be key not just to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the overall crypto market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin below $25k would bring the $20k support level into view and likely threaten a retest of the 52-week cycle lows. On the flipside, rebound to $28k on a confluence of upside triggers could inject fresh momentum and strengthen bulls.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul class="decimal_type">
<li>At press time, SEI was trading at $0.1625 down 12.02% from where it was trading at yesterday the same time.</li>
<li>The token&rsquo;s trading volume has also dropped by 42% in the last 24 hours.</li>
<li>SEI recently announced it was increasing the number of eligible wallets for $SEI Airdrop from 500K to 1.5M wallets.</li>
</ul>
<p>SEI token price dropped to $0.1496 in the early hours of Friday morning, sending shockwaves among investors. The token has seen a very strong performance over the past seven days and it hit an all-time high of $0.2736 on August 16.</p>
<p>But why is the price of SEI dropping? Why is SEI going down after such a magnificent surge? Well, this article shall delve into the details of what caused SEI to take a dive.</p>
<h2>Here&rsquo;s why the SEI price is going down</h2>
<p>This price decline coincided with a decision by Sei Foundation to open airdrop claims to 1 million more wallets than previously anticipated.</p>
<p>Sei blockchain mainnet beta went live on August 15 promising to hold a token airdrop afterwards.</p>
<p>Sei today reported that the number of wallets eligible for the airdrop had surged from the initially planned number of 500,000 wallets to roughly 1.5 million in response to what the Sei Foundation termed &ldquo;fervent demand.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to fervent demand, Sei Foundation has increased the number of eligible wallets for the cross-bridge airdrop from 500K to 1.5M on <a href="https://twitter.com/ethereum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ethereum</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@0xPolygonLabs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@arbitrum</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BNBCHAIN</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/solana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@solana</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@optimismFND</a>  and <a href="https://twitter.com/osmosiszone?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@osmosiszone</a>.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sei Foundation (@Sei_FND) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sei_FND/status/1692070808783368592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The wallet surge is believed to have incorporated users from a variety of other blockchains pouring into the blockchain including but not limited to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, BNB Chain, and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/polygon/what-is-polygon/">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>Sei Foundation had earmarked 3% (300 million) of SEI tokens for the airdrop, which constitute a significant chunk of the 1.8 billion Sei coins currently circulating out of the token&rsquo;s total supply of 10 billion coins.</p>
<p>Token airdrops often trigger a cascade of sell-offs as eligible users rush to convert their newfound coins into cash or other cryptocurrencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin dropped below the $26k level on Thursday, with traders losing nearly $1 billion in the process.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s stage two presale is now closing in on the $1.5 million mark.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been extremely bearish since the start of the week. The prices of most cryptocurrencies are down by more than 5% over the last seven days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the bearish sentiment, Chancer&rsquo;s presale is set to hit another benchmark as stage two is approaching the $1.5 million mark.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin drops to the $25k zone</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has been extremely bearish over the past 24 hours. BTC lost nearly 10% of its value and dropped to the $25,300 level late on Thursday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bearish trend saw long traders lose nearly $1 billion. However, the market is starting to recover, with Bitcoin and others setting new support levels. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $26,543.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What does this mean for Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The bearish performance could see some investors take advantage of the discount price to invest in more cryptocurrency projects. Investors could be looking to purchase more bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies ahead of a likely bullish cycle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As more investors look for projects to invest in, Chancer could be one of the projects they might consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> is one of the exciting and new projects currently in the cryptocurrency space. With stage two presale set to hit an important milestone, it is clear Chancer is gathering momentum amongst retail investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chancer team is currently developing a unique Web3 peer-to-peer (P2P) custom betting platform that would make it possible for users to live-stream betting events.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer wants to decentralise the betting industry and is leveraging blockchain technology to achieve its objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Chancer, there are no restrictions to betting opportunities for users. This implies that users can bet on a wide range of events, beyond traditional sports and casino bets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chancer presale is in its second stage and has raised nearly $1.5 million of the $2 million required. In the second presale, CHANCER is selling for $0.011 USDT but will be increased to $0.012 in the third stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Funds raised from the multiple presale events will be geared towards building Chancer&rsquo;s decentralised P2P betting platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The developers will use the funds raised from the various funding rounds to build a P2P betting platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, Chancer users will have access to a wide range of features, including, betting markets in real-time and based on user interests, social media connections, and expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, with Chancer, users will no longer have to deal with the problems associated with using bookmakers when betting as they would be allowed to set up their custom P2P betting markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">An important feature of&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> is that users can bet on various activities. Users can bet on important sporting or political events or trivial ones like the first to complete a task amongst friends.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">CHANCER to go for $0.012 in the third presale stage</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s second presale stage will be completed soon and the team will move to the next phase. In this current stage, the CHANCER token is going for $0.011 USDT</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the team will increase the token price to $0.012 in the third presale round. Funds generated from the presale will be used to develop Chancer&rsquo;s suite of products. There would be 12 presale events, with an accumulated target of $15 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CHANCER token will power numerous activities within the ecosystem. Token holders can create and invest in markets within the Chancer ecosystem. Furthermore, token holders can also create, participate in, and profit from their very own predictive markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CHANCER token can be purchased using numerous wallets, including, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer website</u></a> to get more information about the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Chancer now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The recent bearish trend in the market could see more investors troop into the market as they look for buying opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors could be looking to invest in projects in their early stages and Chancer could be one of the projects to consider due to its unique native.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By decentralising the betting ecosystem,&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> could gain massive adoption within the Web3 space and beyond. The adoption of the Chancer platform could result in a rally by its native CHANCER token.&nbsp;</p>
