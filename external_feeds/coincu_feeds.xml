<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Arbitrum&#8217;s price holds above the $1.3 support level amid market excitement and Rodeo Finance exploit.</em></li>



<li><em>The network attracts new users and achieves robust utility with over $4 billion TVL, surpassing Polygon and Optimism.</em></li>



<li><em>ARB is trading at $1.31 with resistance at $1.34, a bullish bounce could lead to the conquering of Fib levels at $1.36 and $1.48.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Arbitrum (ARB) price is showing resilience as it holds above the $1.3 support level after a week of market excitement. The question now arises: can this upward trend be sustained?</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-1024x576.png" alt="Arbitrum Price Holds Strong At $1.3: Can The Uptrend Sustain?" class="wp-image-203349" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Arbitrum Price Holds Strong At $1.3: Can The Uptrend Sustain? 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The recent exploit of <a href="https://coincu.com/201687-rodeo-finance-by-1-5-million-defi-attack-latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rodeo Finance</a>, a DeFi Yield-Farming protocol built on the network, where $1.5 million was lost, raised concerns about the security and stability of the ecosystem. However, despite the hack, ARB price has managed to hold the $1.1 support level since it was confirmed by blockchain intelligence platform Peckshield on July 11. This indicates a degree of confidence among investors in the network&#8217;s ability to withstand such incidents.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/203207-arbitrum-will-support-account-abstraction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a> is among the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions competing for dominance, with Optimism being its main rival. In a recent analysis, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon&#8217;s ZK rollup, and Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s opBNB were evaluated. Among these developments, Arbitrum&#8217;s developers have introduced the toolkit for Layer 3 chains, which opens up new opportunities for competition, cheaper transactions, and faster processing. </p>



<p>The Layer 2 solution provided by Arbitrum enhances the speed, flexibility, and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, making it an attractive option for a wide range of DeFi protocols. Through its Layer 3 chains, Arbitrum is actively working on increasing the customizability of projects, addressing a key challenge faced by Layer 2 protocols.</p>



<p>Despite the negative sentiment surrounding the recent exploit, Arbitrum has seen an influx of new users. The weekly Arbitrum report revealed that the network recently surpassed the significant milestone of 300 million transactions. </p>



<p>This achievement underscores the robust utility and growth experienced by the network, despite its inception during a bear market. Additionally, Arbitrum&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) currently <a href="https://defillama.com/chains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stands</a> at $2.177 billion, surpassing both Polygon and rival Optimism in terms of TVL. Furthermore, Arbitrum leads the pack in terms of trading volume, with $373,275,710 recorded in the latest period.</p>

<p>Analyzing the <a href="https://coincu.com/198165-arbitrum-rises-thanks-to-whale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARB</a> price, it is currently trading at $1.31, above the $1.6 resistance level and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. The recent upward movement of three candles suggests that the $1.34 price zone represents the nearest resistance level that ARB must overcome. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="636" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10-1024x636.png" alt="Arbitrum Price Holds Strong At $1.3: Can The Uptrend Sustain?" class="wp-image-203348" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10-1024x636.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10-300x186.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10-768x477.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10-1536x953.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10-2048x1271.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10-750x466.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ARBUSDT_2023-07-17_16-04-10-1140x708.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Arbitrum Price Holds Strong At $1.3: Can The Uptrend Sustain? 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ARB price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, if the price retraces to $1.26, it could indicate a clearer downside movement as the bears solidify their position. Traders and investors are advised to closely monitor the price action, as a strong bullish bounce could signal a potential breakthrough of the next Fibonacci levels at $1.36 and $1.48.</p>



<p>In summary, while the recent exploit posed a challenge for Arbitrum, the network has shown resilience and continued growth. With its Layer 2 solutions and ongoing developments, Arbitrum aims to offer improved scalability, customization, and performance. As the network attracts more users and achieves significant milestones, it remains to be seen whether the current positive trend can be sustained in the long term.</p>

<p>For instance, many companies such as FTX and Celsius have been accused of poor record-keeping and misusing customer funds.</p>



<p>As a result, the Financial Stability Board (<a href="https://www.fsb.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fsb.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">FSB</a>), which groups regulators from some two dozen jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, China and the U.K., published recommendations to ensure “consistent and comprehensive” regulation of the sector. The recommendations build on proposals originally floated in October and are focused on preventing the kind of behavior that has been alleged to have been carried out by companies such as FTX and Celsius.</p>



<p>“The events of the past year have highlighted the intrinsic volatility and structural vulnerabilities of crypto-assets and related players,” said the document. It unveiled new norms that could see major conglomerates forced to separate some of their activities and functions. This is aimed at ensuring that clients’ assets are better protected.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="869" height="580" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2.jpeg" alt="Financial Stability Board Urges Stronger Global Crypto Governance 2" class="wp-image-203342" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2.jpeg 869w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2-750x501.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" title="Financial Stability Board Urges Stronger Global Crypto Governance 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>FTX is one of the companies that have been hit by a wave of allegations of poor record-keeping and misuse of customer funds. Meanwhile, Celsius co-founder and ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky has been arrested in New York on multiple charges that he misled investors and manipulated token prices for personal gain.</p>



<p>In setting out the rationale for tougher global rules, the FSB also referred to the recent collapse of crypto-focused banks, the brief de-pegging of Circle’s USDC stablecoin two months ago, and the sudden downfall of the terraUSD stablecoin in May 2022 that heralded a new crypto winter.</p>



<p>Global players are taking different approaches to how to regulate crypto. While the European Union has crafted a new tailored law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking to argue it can apply existing hundred-year-old rules originally designed for traditional financial instruments.</p>

<p>The principles from the FSB should be flexible enough to allow both approaches, but officials are keen to stress continuity. “This global framework does not rewrite or create a completely new regulatory rulebook for crypto assets,” FSB Secretary General John Schindler told reporters. “Crypto asset activities are not as different from traditional financial activities as some would have us believe, and similar rules should apply.”</p>

<p>Boojum, a Rust-based cryptographic library, will enable the implementation of upgraded versions of ZK circuits for zkSync Era and the ZK Stack. The upgrade represents a significant step towards user-driven decentralization, as the prover runs on consumer-grade GPUs and requires only 16 GB of GPU RAM.</p>



<p>The Boojum upgrade brings several benefits to <a href="https://coincu.com/184583-top-25-whales-on-zksync-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkSync Era</a>. It offers world-class performance, significantly improving scalability to accommodate the envisioned volume for hyperchains. With the ability to process over 100 transactions per second, Boojum provides substantial performance enhancements.</p>



<p>Moreover, Boojum reduces hardware requirements for decentralization, aligning with zkSync&#8217;s long-term goal of enabling user-powered proof generation. The prover&#8217;s compatibility with consumer-grade GPUs and lower GPU RAM requirements makes decentralization more accessible.</p>

<p>Boojum is currently live on the Mainnet, undergoing rigorous testing with real production data to ensure its stability and performance. The zkSync Era team will continue to provide updates on the progress of Boojum, including implementation details, security enhancements, and performance improvements.</p>



<p>The introduction of Boojum marks an important milestone for <a href="https://coincu.com/187304-top-5-new-projects-on-zksync-era-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkSync</a> in realizing its mission of advancing personal freedom through a trustless, secure, and scalable blockchain network. The upgrade&#8217;s ability to deliver world-class performance and enhance decentralization sets the stage for future innovations and widespread adoption within the zkSync ecosystem.</p>

<p>Starting from July 19, 2023, at 02:00 (UTC), users will once again have access to this important functionality. The feature had been temporarily suspended since May 7, 2023, at 09:00 (UTC).</p>



<p>This update brings good news to <a href="https://www.binance.com/en" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en" rel="noreferrer noopener">BNB users</a> as they will now be able to utilize both the &#8220;Total&#8221; and &#8220;Slider for Amount Customization&#8221; features while placing market orders on any Spot or Margin trading pair.

<p>For API users, Binance has provided a convenient way to check the status of the &#8220;Market Order &#8211; Total&#8221; feature for a specific trading pair. By querying the api/v3/exchangeInfo, API users can retrieve information regarding the availability of the feature. If the query returns &#8220;quoteOrderQtyMarketAllowed: true,&#8221; it signifies that the &#8220;Market Order &#8211; Total&#8221; feature is once again active for that particular trading pair.</p>



<p>This update is expected to enhance the trading experience for Binance users, allowing them to execute market orders more efficiently and with greater control. By reinstating the &#8220;Market Order &#8211; Total&#8221; feature, Binance demonstrates its commitment to meeting the needs and preferences of its user base.</p>

<p>In a statement released on Monday, <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Australia Bank</a> stated that it has intervened in over A$270 million ($183.8 million) worth of payments that raised scam concerns between March and July. Despite not disclosing how many of these alerts were triggered by crypto-related scams, NAB has blocked some payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>To ensure its customer&#8217;s safety, National Australia Bank has employed a variety of measures, including introducing payment prompts, taking action on spoofing, and stopping the use of links in unexpected text messages. In addition, the bank has taken action to block some payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges. While NAB did not detail the specific exchanges involved, the bank noted that Australians lost over A$221 million ($150.5 million) last year due to crypto-related scams.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1100.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="464" height="309" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1100.png" alt="image 1100" class="wp-image-203317" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1100.png 464w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1100-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" title="National Australia Bank Blocks Transactions with &#039;High-Risk&#039; Crypto Exchanges 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>NAB&#8217;s decision to block payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges follows similar moves by other Australian banks. Last month, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia also took measures to limit its customers&#8217; ability to send money to crypto exchanges due to crypto-related scams.</p>



<p>According to NAB, nearly 50% of scam funds reported to the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange were linked to cryptocurrency in a recent 30-day period. Chris Sheehan, NAB Executive for Group Investigations and Fraud, stated that &#8220;these scammers are part of organized, transnational crime groups. Increasingly, we&#8217;re seeing them use cryptocurrency platforms to send stolen funds quickly and often overseas.&#8221;</p>

<p>This product utilizes <a href="https://coincu.com/203108-ripple-ceo-rejoices-landmark-court-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP</a> cryptocurrency for efficient money transfers. Ripple&#8217;s optimism stems from a recent court ruling that granted the company a partial victory in its legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Last week, a New York judge <a href="https://coincu.com/202599-ripple-wins-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delivered</a> a significant ruling stating that XRP itself is not inherently security, countering some of the SEC&#8217;s claims against Ripple. The company has been embroiled in a legal dispute with the regulatory body for the past three years, accused of conducting an illegal offering of $1.3 billion through XRP sales. Ripple vehemently denied the allegations, asserting that XRP should be classified as a commodity rather than a security.</p>



<p>The court battle had adverse consequences for Ripple, leading to losing a customer and investor, with MoneyGram terminating its partnership with the company in March 2021. Additionally, Tetragon, a UK-based investor that previously supported the company, sold its stake back to the company after an unsuccessful attempt to sue for redemption.</p>



<p>In light of the court ruling, Ripple&#8217;s general counsel expressed optimism about American banks potentially resuming their utilization of the company&#8217;s ODL product. Alderoty stated that the decision could give financial institutions the confidence to discuss the real-world challenges they face in cross-border value transfers without incurring exorbitant fees.</p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s adoption of blockchain technology facilitates secure message transfers between banks, effectively <a href="https://coincu.com/138053-ripples-iso-20022-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offering</a> an alternative to the traditional Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system.</p>

<p>While the company primarily derives its business from outside the United States, the company aims to spark conversations with US customers in the current quarter, potentially leading to new business opportunities. Ripple&#8217;s workforce consists of approximately 750 employees globally, half of whom are based in the US.</p>



<p>XRP, Ripple&#8217;s cryptocurrency, acts as a bridge currency, enabling seamless money transfers between different fiat currencies without the need for pre-funded accounts. The company emphasizes that XRP can facilitate rapid money movements within seconds.</p>



<p>Although the court ruling was favorable in certain aspects, it was not a complete victory for Ripple. The judge determined that some sales of XRP qualified as securities transactions. Notably, sales totaling around $728.9 million made to institutional buyers were deemed securities due to the presence of a common enterprise and an expectation of profit.</p>

<p>Alderoty acknowledged that Ripple would thoroughly examine the court&#8217;s decision to assess its implications for the company&#8217;s operations. While the ruling on institutional sales may require further scrutiny, Ripple&#8217;s existing business is largely unaffected, as its customer base predominantly resides outside the United States.</p>



<p>As the company prepares to engage in negotiations with US financial institutions, it remains determined to leverage its ODL product and capitalize on the opportunities offered by favorable legal developments. The outcome of these discussions may shape the future landscape of cross-border transactions and Ripple&#8217;s position within the financial industry.</p>

<p>In the past 24 hours, there has been a record-high number of transactions on the Sui blockchain, exceeding 29 million transaction blocks. This surge was primarily driven by the launch of the first on-chain game on Sui called Sui 8192, which is similar in gameplay to the classic puzzle game 2048. </p>



<p>The game is a sliding tile game where players use their arrow keys to shift and combine tiles until they reach a tile worth 8192. Despite its simplicity, Sui 8192 has the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry. On-chain games are becoming increasingly popular as they are ubiquitous and can be played from any device connected to the internet. Additionally, the game is persistent and becomes part of the player&#8217;s digital assets, opening up new possibilities for trading and gifting. This capability sets an example for other apps, such as collaborative productivity tools.</p>

<p>Sui 8192 is a dynamic NFT, exhibiting the unique properties of NFTs on Sui in that it can change its appearance based on user inputs. It demonstrates many interesting new use cases for NFTs, such as using an NFT for an app&#8217;s interface. Ethos was programmed as the first wholly on-chain Sui game. Each newly minted Sui 8192 object contains the game logic, while the interface was coded in javascript, CSS, and HTML.</p>



<p>Sui is a layer-1 blockchain launched in May 2023 and was touted at the time as a &#8220;Solana killer.&#8221; SUI prices were down 0.5% on the day at $0.678 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Binance has announced the release of a new token called Arkham (ARKM) on its Launchpad, which will go on sale for 24 hours starting from July 17, 2023, 06:00 (UTC) to July 18, 2023, 06:00 (UTC). Users can check their eligibility and commit their BNB to the token sale based on their past six-day average BNB holdings. </p>



<p>The BNB rate for the ARKM token sale has been set at 0.00020576 BNB or 0.05 USD (using a BNB price of 243 USD). After the subscription period ends, Binance will list Arkham (ARKM) in the innovation zone and open trading for ARKM/BTC, ARKM/USDT, ARKM/TUSD, ARKM/BNB, and ARKM/TRY trading pairs on July 18, 2023, 12:00 (UTC).</p>



<p>To protect users from high volatility when trading commences under Launchpad, Binance will trial an initial price limit mechanism where, for the first five minutes of trading, the maximum transaction price is set at ten times the public sale token price (i.e., in the case of ARKM, $0.50, ten times the public sale token price). After the initial five minutes, there will be no restrictions, and trading will continue normally. Note that this initial price limit mechanism is being trialed for the ARKM token launch, and it is yet to be determined if this will be an ongoing feature of all future Launchpads.</p>



<p>Users will have 24 hours to subscribe by committing their BNB tokens between July 17, 2023, 06:00 (UTC) and July 18, 2023, 06:00 (UTC). Users can subscribe to BNB at any time during these 24 hours. Users must also sign the ARKM Token Purchase Agreement before committing to their BNB. The hard cap for ARKM token allocation per user is 15,000 USD (300,000 ARKM or 61.728 BNB), and the maximum amount of BNB that each user can commit has been calculated based on their past six-day average BNB balance.</p>



<p>Once committed, users&#8217; BNB will be locked, and they cannot redeem or access any other functions, such as transfers, withdrawals, or trading, until final token distribution. After the subscription period ends on July 18, 2023, at 06:00 (UTC), the ARKM token allocation calculation will begin and will take one hour. </p>



<p>The final ARKM token allocation results will be revealed on July 18, 2023, 07:00 (UTC), at this point, the respective BNB will be deducted from users&#8217; already-locked BNB amount within 60 minutes. Once deducted, users&#8217; ARKM and remaining BNB tokens will both be transferred to their spot wallet.</p>

<p>UniSat Wallet recently announced the launch of brc20-swap, which they claim to be the first-ever Ordinals native swap that runs on the Bitcoin mainnet and utilizes the brc20 protocol. However, <a href="https://coincu.com/201712-okx-launches-brc20-s-a-new-staking-mechanism/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/201712-okx-launches-brc20-s-a-new-staking-mechanism/" rel="noreferrer noopener">some </a>have questioned whether this function is a centralized swap, as the current Bitcoin network does not support smart contracts, making it difficult to achieve a fully decentralized DEX Swap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, we&#39;re proud to announce brc20-swap, <br><br>the first-ever Ordinals native swap, floating on top of bitcoin mainnet, utilizing brc20 protocol as its underlying asset infrastructure. <br><br>(1/12) <a href="https://t.co/PpEU9Js3OG" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/PpEU9Js3OG</a></p>&mdash; UniSat Wallet &#8211; Store, Inscribe and Search. (@unisat_wallet) <a href="https://twitter.com/unisat_wallet/status/1680555419347894278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>UniSat has been receiving proposals from various teams and individuals who are eager to extend the capabilities of brc20. They are enthusiastic about supporting these innovations and aim to make the UniSat brc20 indexer highly competitive in this space. Supporting these ideas aligns with their commitment to pushing the boundaries of brc20 itself and showcasing its full flexibility and extensibility.</p>



<p>brc20-swap is designed to be simple to understand and permissionless to join. Anyone should be able to deploy a new trading pair and then add liquidity to a given swap, just like deploying and minting a classic brc20. While there may be some complexities involved, it&#8217;s designed to be convenient for developers to deploy a service instance of brc20-swap independently. UniSat will provide source code, APIs, and docs to help users build swaps based on this one.</p>



<p>OKX CEO Star Xu questioned whether this function is a centralized swap. Since the current Bitcoin network does not support smart contracts, achieving a fully decentralized DEX Swap isn&#8217;t easy.</p>
