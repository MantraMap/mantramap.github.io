<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>InfiniMerge, the first title from Web3 gaming studio InfiniGods, has exited beta and is now open to the general public.</em></li>



<li><em>InfiniGods players can create their own in-game power-ups usable for gameplay or tradeable with other players, and the game is inspired by games like Candy Crush, Triple Town, and City Block.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>InfiniMerge, a free-to-play merging game developed with blockchain technology, has officially <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/web3-gaming-studio-infinigods-launches-first-game-infinimerge-301726902.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> today, according to InfiniGods, a Web3 gaming company formed by veterans of the social and mobile industries.</strong></h5>

<p>InfiniMerge is a puzzle game inspired by the likes of <strong>Candy Crush, City Block</strong>, and <strong>Triple Town.</strong> Every day, a brand-new level in the game based on mythology and antiquity is made available to gamers.</p>



<p><strong>InfiniMerge</strong> is the first game from <a href="https://twitter.com/InfiniGods/status/1616483492128333824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">InfiniGods</a>, and it received<strong> $9 million </strong>in seed investment from <strong>Pantera Capital, Framework Ventures,</strong> and Animoca Brands. Co-founders <strong>Owen O&#8217;Donoghue</strong>, a former director of gaming at Facebook, and <strong>Damon Gura</strong>, a former CEO and board member of DGN Games, are in charge of <strong>InfiniGods</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>InfiniMerge</strong> has attracted more than<strong> 1,000 participants</strong> since it entered beta, with an amazing day-one retention rate of more than <strong>40% </strong>and a day-7 retention rate of <strong>10%</strong>. Compared to other puzzle games, the InfiniGods team has seen substantially greater retention rates, with NFT holders playing the game more frequently than non-NFT holders.</p>



<p>Co-Founder and CEO of InfiniGods<strong> Damon Gura</strong> said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Merge games are popular for their simple mechanics and straightforward progression, and InfiniMerge combines all this with Web3 elements like digital collectibles and play-to-own rewards. We believe that Web3 gaming will only reach its potential if games are fun and accessible, and that’s the objective we’ve sought to achieve with InfiniMerge.”</p>

<p>The rapid feedback loop, which has emerged as a distinctive asset of Web3 gaming, is also advantageous to InfiniMerge. The InfiniGods team has used a dedicated Discord support channel to find faults and apply speedy fixes based on user feedback.</p>



<p><strong>InfiniGods</strong> has launched <strong>Community Merge </strong>to further engage a wide range of Web3 gamers. Through this program, one well-liked project is chosen each calendar quarter and turned into an interactive, playable experience on InfiniMerge using the company&#8217;s current resources. <strong>Wolf Game</strong> is the name of the first Community Merge level that may be played.</p>

<h5><strong>The past year has marked the boom of one of the hit GameFi called StepN with the Move to Earn model, or so to speak, until its downturn. So in 2023, what will happen next?</strong></h5>



<p>Looking back on the complete <strong>bottom→peak→bottom</strong> encryption industry cycle from 2020 to 2022, the three new tracks of DeFi, NFT, and blockchain games are dancing, and the most dazzling in the chain game track are two projects <strong>Axie</strong> and <strong>StepN</strong>: Axie created the <strong>&#8220;Play to Earn&#8221; mode</strong>, which led to the frenzy of small picture gold mining; while <strong>StepN</strong> took a slant after the decline of Axie, using the<strong> &#8220;Walk to Earn&#8221; light mode </strong>that is closer to the player&#8217;s real life, to guide players to build a consensus: In addition to making money in the game, you can also find cool points for gaining health. </p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">X to Earn model</h2>



<p>Judging from the old player retention rate indicators and the actual effect of urging sports, StepN is indeed the first chain game with a breaking effect and can even be evaluated as an excellent Web3 product, so the track of X to Earn It suddenly emerged and became one of the most important modules in chain games.</p>



<p>StepN’s walking to earn money has spread all over the encryption circle, <strong>especially the “four-day payback” after the shoes are on the BNB Chain</strong>, which made the madness reach its peak. <strong>Various X to Earn projects emerge in endlessly.</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Move to Earn track analysis&#8221; analyzed several StepN imitation disks, but before finishing writing, <strong>StepN began to ebb on the B chain</strong> (the second chain), and the cooling speed was faster than our codeword speed, so it&#8217;s unfinished… </p>

<p>Is the problem with the gameplay and operation of <strong>StepN</strong>? I don’t think so. The original sin is the dual-token model developed based on Axie. The underlying logic of this type of model has led to <strong>“Fomo succeeds and Fomo fails.” </strong>Its life cycle is extended compared to other projects.</p>



<p>The <strong>X to Earn </strong>track is still a hot spot in the eyes of players and investment institutions, mainly because it can be out of the circle and it may be combined with real life. But if you think about it carefully, are the projects in<strong> X to Earn</strong> really homogeneous? How to classify from different angles? How to judge whether the project is good or bad from the perspective of investment logic?</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Sleepagotchi</h2>



<p>According to the level of the threshold for using the product on the <strong>client side (C side)</strong>, we have established<strong> a &#8220;life application&#8221; standard</strong>, in which the product is to extract some of the actions that frequently occur in the player&#8217;s life, allowing you to earn while doing it. As a player, you have to do these actions. You use this kind of product while doing it, and then give you rewards as encouragement. I hope you can do better.</p>



<p>The life application category can be further subdivided into light-duty and heavy-duty categories. The light-loaded category means that this product can be played without purchasing other heavy-duty external equipment, and the entry threshold for C-end users is low. </p>



<p>For example, in <a href="https://sleepagotchi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sleepagotchi</a> (assuming that sleeping products do not need to purchase additional equipment separately and directly use off-the-shelf equipment such as mobile phones or watches), individuals can sleep; such as StepN, as long as they have shoes, they can run.</p>

<p>Light-weight products currently appear to have two characteristics:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, the lighter the product, the more audiences it has, and the greater the possibility of getting out of the circle. Investment institutions currently choose projects on the X to Earn track, which tends to be as light as possible, such as Sleepagotchi. It is said that many institutions did not have a quota to invest in before;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Second, the lighter the product, the stronger the refreshing point that needs to impress the player, that is to say, the more obvious the other benefits that the player can get from this product besides Earn. <br>For example, products in the category of reading books are the most important among light-packed products. People who love to read have already formed private domain traffic, and they can use this product just for the hobby of reading. But as far as sleeping products are concerned, sleeping is not a hobby but something that everyone must do, so this product needs to have another extra powerful function to empower it (besides making money).</li>

<p>Take the Sleepagotchi product as an example, it emphasizes the function of improving sleep, similar to SleepOn in Web2 To be honest, if Sleepagotchi can really play such a function, not to mention that I can make money by using it, I am willing to spend money to buy this product, which is the melatonin in Web3. </p>



<p>There is also the familiar running category <strong>StepN</strong>, which is heavier than the sleeping category and lighter than the skipping category and reading category, so it introduces the concept of &#8220;running more to be healthy.&#8221; It can be seen that the two projects, <strong>Sleepagotchi</strong> and <strong>StepN</strong>, have a common positive and positive narrative:<strong> Sleepagotchi is to promote a healthy routine</strong> (higher sleep quality and more falls), and <strong>StepN is to promote oneself to develop of exercise habits</strong> (long running time the longer the period, the greater the income).</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Hooked Protocol</h2>



<p>Here is a brief analysis of the recently popular <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151616-the-price-of-hook-dropped-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hook</a>, which is the star product of Binance’s IEO launch after 9 months of holding back. It belongs to the <strong>“Learn to Earn” type</strong>, and you can get rewards through questions and answers. From the perspective of product design logic, I personally don’t like it because:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, the barriers to entry are very low, and everyone can answer questions. The point is, is answering questions necessary every day? This is not the same as sleeping and walking.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Second, there is no cool point. Learning is anti-human, and liking leisure and hating work is the root of human nature, and can answering questions become a hobby like reading or running?</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Third, can users be encouraged to show off at the wine table after acquiring knowledge? </li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204-1024x575.png" alt="image 1204" class="wp-image-161630" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204-1024x575.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204-1536x863.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204-750x421.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1204.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Next StepN To Boom In 2023.

<p>Therefore, I feel that Hook&#8217;s product usage logic is weird, and it is purely for making money to answer questions. I don’t know if Binance had thought about what I said above when it promoted it. But these analyzes are really not important, as long as there is a good father of Binance, it is the last word.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The <strong>X to Earn </strong>track will always be a hot spot. If it is a life application category, analyze it from the perspective of the C-end, specific to several dimensions: the severity of the user entry threshold and the number of participants, whether the cool point is enough to convince people, and the difficulty of private domain traffic.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/42868-what-is-tokenomics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokenomics</a>, a blend of<strong> &#8220;token&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;economics,&#8221;</strong> is a catch-all term for the characteristics that provide a certain cryptocurrency value and appeal to investors. This covers everything from a token&#8217;s quantity and issuance method to factors like its usefulness.</p>



<p>But we all know this is not going to survive the next wave of crypto, and the winter season is a good time for builders to settle down and craft well-founded tokens that deliver sustainable outcomes for next-generation protocols.</p>



<p>In our content today, we provide you builders with a new perspective. The discussion begins with our belief that protocol tokens should follow two fundamental design principles:</p>



<ol>
<li>Tokenomics should reconcile public benefits that are difficult for participants to provide efficiently and economically on their own.</li>



<li>Tokenomics should direct value to those who create value, prioritizing value distribution to high-utility groups rather than value transfer between participants.</li>
</ol>



<p>Similar to the<strong> &#8220;Liquidity Mining&#8221; framework, </strong>these design principles are based on the basic idea of rational and value-maximizing economic exchange. There is no free lunch in the world, and short-term gimmicks are often at the expense of long-term value. Both project owners and participants should look for designs that clearly create and distribute fundamental value and be skeptical of designs that do not.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The importance of a good tokenomics model</h2>



<p>The term tokenomics is vaguely defined and fascinating. It is a catch-all term that includes all of the following design categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>Initial supply and distribution to the team, investors, community and other stakeholders</li>



<li>Distribution methods, including token purchases, airdrops, grants and partnerships</li>



<li>Revenue distribution between users, service providers and protocols</li>



<li>Fund size, structure and intended use</li>



<li>Issuance schedule, including inflation, minting/burning rights and supply caps</li>



<li>Token governance, including voting, escrow, stake weighting, vesting and metrics</li>



<li>Compensation for miners and verifiers, such as fees, fines, etc.,</li>



<li>The use of protocol native tokens and external tokens (such as <strong>ETH</strong>, <strong>USDC</strong>)</li>
</ul>



<p>In this article, we will refer to tokenomics as the token-based distribution of incentives. We focus not on individual and operational issues but on defining first principles. Based on these principles, protocol designers can answer each question based on the most pressing trade-offs and concerns for their particular product.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1196.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="550" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1196.png" alt="The Huge Impact Of Tokenomics And Its Two Core Principles" class="wp-image-161597" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1196.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1196-300x165.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1196-768x422.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1196-750x413.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="The Huge Impact Of Tokenomics And Its Two Core Principles 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<h3><strong>Provide public benefit</strong></h3>



<p>The first core tenet of a strong tokenomics model is the ability to provide a public good. A good design should address the problem of collective action, organizing and motivating participants to collectively provide services that cannot be generated by individual actions.</p>



<p>Without a reward system, no participant would want to provide security for the network. But with a reward system, that decision-making changes. Participants stake for individually rational reasons, but collectively they provide benefits that can be enjoyed by all.</p>



<p>The public interest in crypto is motivated by the same incentives as taxpayer-funded goods and services such as public transportation, national defense, or public schools. In both cases, a well-designed public good typically has the following properties:</p>



<ul>
<li>Positive net utility: Total benefits to the community as a whole exceed total costs.</li>



<li>Cannot be privatized: It is not economical for individuals to provide the goods due to direct costs and coordination costs.</li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>Align rewards with value creation</strong></h3>



<p>A second core principle of a tokenomics model is the ability to compensate individuals for value created (and destroyed). In other words, a good design creates a clear and salient link between action and reward, maximizing incentives to create value.</p>



<p>At a high level, compensation (and punishment) for any participant in the system can theoretically be broken down into two parts: consistent (what they gain by providing value) and non-coherent (anything else). For example, the benefits of cutting a dishonest validator will be consistent since the cost is associated with the change in value (in this case, the loss). In contrast, giving a random validator a large token bounty would be inconsistent since there would be no value to justify that bounty.</p>



<p>While this is simple in theory, it is much more complicated in practice. First, any interaction within the system is often shared responsibility by multiple parties, and attribution is not always measurable. Second, the rewards for many key actions are remote (e.g., distributing community grants, establishing long-term partnerships, etc.), making it difficult to develop clear incentives upfront. Nonetheless, we believe this is a key principle that protocol builders should strive to achieve.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1200.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="478" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1200-1024x478.png" alt="The Huge Impact Of Tokenomics And Its Two Core Principles" class="wp-image-161624" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1200-1024x478.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1200-300x140.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1200-768x358.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1200-750x350.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1200-1140x532.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1200.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="The Huge Impact Of Tokenomics And Its Two Core Principles 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, there is a strong link between consistent compensation and long-term value maximization. When protocol designers choose between optimizing short-term target metrics and long-term utility, two trends emerge in practice:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Consistent&#8221; health:</strong> Consistent compensation incentivizes commitment to risk or cost and other forms of long-term investment. Conversely, inconsistent compensation incentivizes employed capital, which tends to preserve maximum freedom to exit. For example, “farm-dumping” (i.e. immediate sale of rewarded tokens) demonstrates an asymmetry in liquidity mining.</li>



<li><strong>&#8220;Distorted&#8221; is costly: </strong>design mechanisms without adjustment compensation tend to destroy long-term value, especially when interacting with feedback loops. For example, artificially high rewards for holders of NFT collectibles could trigger speculative behavior, with brutal reversals once the rewards are exhausted—potentially destroying the perceived value of the collectible.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Some future ideas for the tokenomics</h2>



<p>So far, we have applied our principles retrospectively and graded existing models according to their performance. Furthermore, how else can we provide direct and targeted incentives to individual champions of the public good?</p>



<p><strong>Decentralization: </strong>Miner honesty is highly incentivized in practice, but miner diversity is rarely considered. In theory, miner diversity is widely understood as a form of public product. Does it make sense to have a progressive tax on validator rewards above a certain stake size?</p>



<p><strong>Marketing:</strong> Visibility is critical to a protocol&#8217;s survival, so first, having a value in the sense of providing initial liquidity or usage to the network. Once a protocol reaches critical mass, participation driven by artificial rewards can be incremental or harmful. </p>



<p>Could the protocol reward early supporters by offering larger rewards to the first &#8220;X million&#8221; in TVL and then amortize those rewards as total liquidity grows? (APY is already falling as TVL rises, so this would be a more substantial drawdown above some expected level of liquidity.)</p>



<p><strong>Grants and partnerships:</strong> Token cap tables often include large, open-ended allocations for developers building on the protocol and partners integrating with the protocol. However, these rewards can be quite decentralized and actionable. Is it possible to tie grant-based token rewards to on-chain metrics in a way that is not exploitable?</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Token design is difficult because it requires answering a highly abstract, open-ended question: what deserves to be incentivized? It would be ideal if the protocol could try out different models, solicit early feedback, and iterate. But most teams only get one chance to set the dynamics of the system and must provide a solid foundation on the first try. We believe following these two core principles—creating common good and aligning rewards—will give these teams the best chance for long-term success.</p>



<p>This burden also falls on the wider community. Early investors, retail participants, and protocol users should all drive strong and principled token economics — now more than ever. During the last crypto bull run, many of the momentum-driven designs could only last in this exuberant market. Despite its flaws, a bear market needs real utility from the start.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points: </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Esteban Ordano and Ari Meilich, co-founders of Decentraland, were named as Genesis creditors that invested in Genesis Global.</em></li>



<li><em>Heliva International, to whom Genesis Global owes $55 million, has designated Decentraland CFO Santiago Esponda as a point of contact.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Three of the CEOs and creators of the virtual reality platform Decentraland are among the 50 largest Genesis creditors, the cryptocurrency lender that on Thursday filed for bankruptcy.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Santiago Esponda</strong>, the CFO of Decentraland, attracted notice because his Decentraland email address appeared in court documents as the point of contact for Heliva International, a Panama-based business that <strong>Genesis owes $55 million</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recognizable names among Genesis creditors:<br><br>• Gemini: $765m<br>• Mirana (Bybit?): $151m<br>• Moonalpha (Babel): $150m<br>• Coincident Cap (Mex/Finex Leaderboarders): $110m<br>• Decentraland: $55m<br>• VanEck: $53m<br>• Abra: $30m<br>• Cumberland: $18m<br>• Stellar Foundation: $13m</p>&mdash; Hsaka (@HsakaTrades) <a href="https://twitter.com/HsakaTrades/status/1616304720385122306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>But a closer examination reveals that <strong>the documents also mention the two co-founders of Decentraland </strong>using email addresses that are not associated with Decentraland.</p>



<p>The contact for a company called Winah Securities is described as<strong> Esteban Ordano, a co-founder of Decentraland </strong>who currently serves as an adviser. <strong>Winah</strong>, which is situated on the same level and in the same building as Heliva, owes over $27 million to Genesis. According to Ordano,<strong> Winah and Decentraland have no connection.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Big Time Studios</strong>, a gaming firm, is due<strong> $20 million</strong>. <strong>Ari Meilich</strong>, another co-founder of Decentraland, is in charge of it. He launched Big Time in 2020, yet he is still an advisor to Decentraland. Meilich opted not to respond.</p>

<p>Another connection to Decentraland is provided by the credit business Ripio, which is registered in the Cayman Islands and introduced a mortgage service for buying virtual land in Decentraland in 2018.</p>



<p>Genesis Global, the lending division of the Genesis brokerage owned by Digital Currency Group, filed for bankruptcy protection late yesterday. Following the demise of FTX, a massive cryptocurrency exchange, the company locked client cash in November.</p>

<p>It has been previously asserted that the<strong>&nbsp;top 50 creditors of FTX</strong>, together have a total debt of around&nbsp;$3.1 billion dollars, however, the specific information on the other creditors has not yet been made public.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Venom Ventures</strong>, located in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/146293-hayvn-considers-acquiring-ftx/">Abu Dhabi</a>, has announced that it has raised <strong>$1 billion in capital to invest in web3 and blockchain technologies.</strong> &#8220;This is an excellent opportunity to introduce something like this,&#8221; fund spokesman<strong> Peter Knez </strong>remarked. Many worthwhile projects are having difficulty getting funds. We have the funds and will assist them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Knez has worked in the past for both <strong>Lincoln Capital Management and Goldman Sachs, </strong>where he held positions as co-chief investment officer for the <strong>fixed income group at BlackRock.</strong> According to the website of the venture capital fund Venom, the fund will choose businesses that have a great deal of promise, and after that,<strong> the fund will give investment packages ranging from $25,000 to $200,000.</strong></p>

<p>According to Knez, &#8220;Our aim at Venom Ventures is to invest from seed stages all the way up to<strong> Series A, B, and C and then an initial public offering.</strong> One of the purposes of the fund is to invest abroad, however the fund&#8217;s primary focus is on providing assistance to<strong> initiatives located in Abu Dhabi.</strong>&#8221; The Foundation will examine each and every idea, not only the ones that have already been decided to be developed on Venom.</p>



<p>In terms of its intentions, the purpose of the fund is to <strong>encourage the expansion of Web3 and blockchain in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</strong> Web3 and blockchain have been the key areas of focus for this Middle Eastern nation throughout the course of the last calendar year.</p>

<p>Genesis owes more than<strong> $3.5 billion to the top 50 creditors,</strong> including Cumberland ($18 million), as previously reported. With bonds totalling<strong> $226.3 million dollars</strong>, Genesis Global Capital has become <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161569-dcg-owes-subsidiary-genesis-global/">the largest unsecured creditor of FTX.com</a> and its affiliates. Furthermore, <strong>on January 20</strong>, Genesis Global and its affiliated organizations filed for bankruptcy, claiming that the parent company <strong>Digital Currency Group (DCG) owes its subsidiary Genesis more than $1.65 billion.</strong> A special committee of the board of directors of GGH, the Genesis entity&#8217;s holding company, is investigating funding operations between GGC and DCG to see whether the bankrupt corporation has viable claims against this firm that might aid in restructuring.</p>



<p>Genesis invested in the failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Genesis was forced to limit withdrawals in its lending sector immediately after FTX&#8217;s Chapter 11 filing in November, with Gemini, t<strong>he crypto exchange controlled by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, being a prominent customer. </strong>Since then, CEO Cameron Winklevoss has publicly chastised Genesis, DCG, and its CEO, Barry Silbert.</p>



<p>Genesis Global Holdco LLC, Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., and Genesis Global Capital LLC all filed papers for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Thursday night.</p>

<p>According to documents submitted to the<strong> United States Bankruptcy Court</strong> for the Southern District of New York, cryptocurrency lender <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161569-dcg-owes-subsidiary-genesis-global/">Genesis Global Capital</a> is making preparations to emerge from bankruptcy on or <strong>around May 19</strong>.</p>



<p>In the statement that it was filing for bankruptcy, the firm stated that it was looking into the <strong>possibility of selling itself or going through an equity procedure in order to continue operations under new ownership</strong>. Gemini users are impacted in some way by the solutions that were developed in Chapter 11. The firm has stated that it is considering a variety of alternatives in order to <strong>provide customers of Genesis and users of Gemini Earn with the most favorable conclusion possible.</strong></p>

<p>According to documents filed in bankruptcy court, the organization, which has the support of <strong>Barry Silbert&#8217;s Digital Currency Group</strong>, intends to emerge from the shelter provided by <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161526-genesis-global-filed-bankruptcy-protection/">Chapter 11 </a>no later than May 19. If it is successful, <strong>the four-month reorganization</strong> will equate to a procedure that is far quicker than what has been witnessed for other crypto lending companies that have failed, such as <strong>Voyager Digital Ltd. and Celsius Network LLC.</strong></p>



<p>According to the court filings, <strong>Genesis is accepting offers for all of its properties until the 14th of April.</strong> If the firm is unable to sell itself to repay its customers, those customers will be given equity in the company that emerges from bankruptcy.</p>



<p>This matter is being handled by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of <strong>New York under case number 23-10063. (Manhattan).</strong></p>

<p><strong>The filings on Thursday</strong> are the latest in a series of high-profile disasters that have rocked the crypto sector in the last year, including the Terra implosion and, more recently, the fall of the FTX crypto exchange.</p>



<p><strong>Genesis</strong> became involved with the hedge fund <strong>Three Arrows Capital and the crypto exchange FTX</strong>, both of which went bankrupt. Genesis was obliged to restrict withdrawals in its lending section shortly after FTX&#8217;s Chapter 11 filing in November, a key customer of which was Gemini, the crypto exchange owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Since then, CEO Cameron Winklevoss has launched a public campaign against Genesis, DCG, and its CEO, Barry Silbert.</p>



<p>Earlier today, it was revealed that <strong>Genesis owed more than $3.5 billion to the top 50 creditors</strong>, which included Gemini, Mirana, Decentraland, and others.</p>

<li><em>Bybit Earn products do not use Mirana. In addition, Genesis secured approximately $120 million worth of collateral on Mirana&#8217;s $151 million borrowing, which has since been liquidated.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Shortly after Genesis Global filed for bankruptcy protection, several industry players confirmed their association with the company. Bybit is one of them, and its CEO has clarified issues related to exposure to Genesis to answer questions from the community.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>Ben Zhou </strong>stated in a tweet that Mirana is a company investment arm, but it only handles a portion of the company&#8217;s assets and is not connected to client funds. <strong>Mirana</strong> is not used by goods from <strong>Bybit Earn</strong>. On top of that, <strong>Genesis</strong> obtained collateral for <strong>Mirana&#8217;s $151 million financing</strong>, which was ultimately liquidated, totaling about <strong>$120 million</strong>.</p>

<p>On January 20, <strong>Genesis Global Trading</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161526-genesis-global-filed-bankruptcy-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requested</a> Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York, becoming the newest business to do so in the aftermath of FTX&#8217;s failure. The cryptocurrency community&#8217;s attention has since turned to other businesses that have contact with the loan firm.</p>



<p>Genesis owes its <strong>top 50 debtors</strong> a total of over <strong>$3.5 billion</strong>, including the cryptocurrency exchange <strong>Gemini</strong>, the market leader <strong>Cumberland, Mirana, MoonAlpha Finance,</strong> and VanEck&#8217;s<strong> New Finance Income Fund.</strong></p>



<p>These companies make up Genesis&#8217; crypto financing division, which was upended by the collapses of hedge fund <strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong> and cryptocurrency exchange <strong>FTX</strong> last year.</p>
