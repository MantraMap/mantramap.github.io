<p>BTC/USD Upside Momentum Rallies:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 16 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to reclaim recent upside progress early in the Asian session as the pair moderated after recently peaking around the 18385.36 level, its strongest print since early November.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 17694.98 level during the pullback, representing the 23.6% retracement of the recent broader appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;Additional retracement levels in this appreciating range include the 17267.87, 16922.68, 16577.49, 16150.38, and 16086.03.&nbsp; &nbsp;Risk aversion has been reduced in recent days and traders have been able to propel BTC/USD to multi-week highs after Stops were elected above the 17779.81 and 17872.75 levels.&nbsp; Additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; Following recent gains from two-year lows around the 15460 area, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 17400.55, 17029.71, 16730, 16430.28, 16059.44, and 16003.56 areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17220.71 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17757.07.</p>
