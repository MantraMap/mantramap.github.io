Ethereum Price Holds Ground Ethereum’s price saw a couple of swing moves from the $1,800 support zone. First, ETH rallied above the $1,900 resistance. However, it faced a strong selling interest near $1,960 and reacted to the downside. There was a sharp 10% drop below $1,900, similar to Bitcoin from $30,000. The price retested the main $1,800 support zone. A low is formed near $1,787 and the price is again rising. It is trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Ether is also trading above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,964 swing high to the $1,787 low. Immediate resistance is near the $1,920 zone. Besides, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,925 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $1,964 swing high to the $1,787 low. A close above the $1,925 level might spark more bullish moves.

Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,000 resistance, above which the bulls might aim for a move toward $2,120. Fresh Decline in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,925 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,880 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.
