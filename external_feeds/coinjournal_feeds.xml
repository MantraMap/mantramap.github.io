<p dir="ltr">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was recently arrested by authorities in The Bahamas and has been charged by the US SEC.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Patrick McHenry revealed that the former FTX chairman tried to buy off Washington.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">FTX&rsquo;s collapse continues to make headlines in the crypto market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SBF attempted to buy off Washington</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Congressman Patrick McHenry told CNBC in an interview earlier today that the former FTX CEO attempted to buy off Washington. He made this statement when asked about FTX&rsquo;s influence in Congress.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Do you think <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SBF_FTX</a> bought off Washington?" <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewrsorkin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@andrewrsorkin</a> asks <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PatrickMcHenry</a>: <a href="https://t.co/WJlqSYWuOA">pic.twitter.com/WJlqSYWuOA</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1602647911690633217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
<p dir="ltr">SBF was reported to have been a major donor to politicians in the United States. When asked if SBF bought off Washington, McHenry said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;He tried to buy off Washington. And if you look at his interview with Vox, it shows that he was a manipulator of world-class capacity. He was trying to pull off something that was light-touch regulation for his platform.&rdquo;</em><br>The Congressman said he is looking for a proper balance in the crypto space so that consumers will not fall prey to FTX or some successor of Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">SBF was arrested a few hours ago in the Bahamas as he was set to appear before the United States House Committee on Finance Services. When asked about the timing of the arrest, McHenry said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;In his short career, SBF has shown himself to be a highly unreliable witness. I don&rsquo;t have high expectations that he was going to expose the world or Congress to some deeper insight. I think it was important to have him and further the process of what happened.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>US SEC charges SBF with defrauding FTX investors</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&nbsp;<a href="https://invezz.com/news/2022/12/13/sec-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-defrauding-ftx-investors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>charged SBF</u></a> with defrauding FTX investors a few hours ago. The charges protect institutional investors that invested in FTX but not the actual customers who had money on the platform. When asked about the contents of the SEC&rsquo;s charges, McHenry said the lack of clear regulation around cryptocurrencies and digital assets makes it hard for regulators to argue their cases. The regulatory agencies have clear regulations for commodities and equities but none yet for digital assets. He added that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Regulators have clearly failed to regulate digital assets. It is now incumbent on Congress to specify the law so that the regulators can regulate. That is going to be my focus as the next chair of the House Finance Services Committee.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">In an interview earlier this month, Michael Saylor, the MicroStrategy executive chairman,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftxs-fiasco-was-unethical-and-illegal-from-the-very-beginning-says-michael-saylor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said he believes</u></a> the FTX fiasco was unethical and illegal from the beginning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mike Novogratz also&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/sam-was-delusional-about-what-happened-says-mike-novogratz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said SBF is delusional</u></a> about what happened with FTX and his role in bringing down the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Coinbase supports USDC trading on Avalanche</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, announced on Monday, that it had launched the ability to trade native USDC (USDC) on Avalanche. This means that the USDC stablecoin on Coinbase will now be available on Avalanche.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&rsquo;ve launched the ability to trade native USDC (USDC) on Avalanche. One of the most trusted and reputable digital dollars is now more flexible than ever. Keep an eye out for additional multi-chain availability. Note: deposits of USDC.e are not supported at this time. <a href="https://t.co/W0vSGMRNac">pic.twitter.com/W0vSGMRNac</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">This <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> has seen AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche network, become the best performer amongst the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. At press time, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/avalanche/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Avalanche</u></a> stands at $13.81, up by more than 8% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The broader crypto market has also recovered from the slump suffered yesterday. The total crypto market cap now stands at $872 billion, up by more than 3.5% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin and Ether have been performing well, and are up by 5% and 6%, respectively, so far today.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Key levels to watch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The AVAX/USD 4-hour chart is turning bullish as Avalanche has been performing well in the last couple of hours. The technical indicators show that it could soon turn bullish as the market recovery continues.</p>

<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">The MACD line is closing in on the positive territory, indicating that the bulls are taking charge of the AVAX market. The 14-day RSI of 67 also shows that AVAX could soon enter the overbought region if the rally continues. AVAX could move past the first major resistance level at $15.22 over the next few hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the event of an extended rally, AVAX could make a move toward the $17.43 resistance level for the first time in a month. However, it would need the help of the broader crypto market to make an attempt for the $20 psychological level in the near term.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>San Francisco, USA, 13th December, 2022, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.azarus.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Azarus</u></a> will be hosting a keynote stream in partnership with <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Animoca Brands</u></a> at 7am UTC on Wednesday, December 14th (11pm PST on Tuesday, December 13th) to reveal the imminent listing on Uniswap of the AzaCoin, an ERC-20 Token on Ethereum Mainnet, which will list on Uniswap on January 11, 2023.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Azarus has been demonstrating that &ldquo;streams are not TV&rdquo; through its highly engaging Overlay Games. With Azarus, streamers run interactive games over their streams to play along in real-time with their entire audience, sponsored by brands. Overlay Games have generated over 4 million watch hours, distributing $2 million in prizes in the form of loyalty points redeemable in the Azarus Store.</p>
<p>Azarus is moving into a crypto-native rewards program, which will expose millions of loyal players to the benefits of true digital ownership. Azarus is upgrading its AZA points into a crypto-native token, the AzaCoin, giving Azarus holders ownership of the value of their attention and engagement. The AzaCoin will serve as a utility and governance token with the following benefits to the ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Streamers: Get immediate access to your earnings with AzaCoins. Host game sessions using your channel&rsquo;s community wallet. Engage your community through voting.</li>
<li>For Streaming Communities: Gain full ownership of your rewards as AzaCoin is distributed directly to a winner&rsquo;s crypto wallet offering full control to redeem prizes, bid and buy instantly on streams or to purchase digital assets on the Azarus Marketplace</li>
<li>For Brands: Run and sponsor games for streamers using Azarus as part of their programming</li>
</ul>
<p>This shared desire to participate in the Azarus ecosystem creates a mutually beneficial opportunity as stakeholder incentives align, amplifying the value of the token.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Azarus has been built on blockchain since the early days, with the vision to materialize the true nature of streams as a distributed digital stadium,&rdquo; said founder Alex Cassassovici. &ldquo;Listing the AzaCoin today brings us one step closer to this vision, aligning incentives of all stakeholders and giving the fans true ownership of the rewards they collect playing on stream.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our belief that Azarus will bring web3 to millions of new users,&rdquo; wrote Animoca Brands founder Yat Siu. &ldquo;Since our initial investment, we have been continually impressed at Alex&rsquo;s leadership in transforming the medium of streaming into web3 that has already rewarded millions of players with millions of dollars. We&rsquo;re beyond excited for the future of Azarus and are proud investors and partners.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Holders of AzaCoin will have the option to stake their token for 3 months upon earning them in return for receiving a percentage yield back. As a governance token, AzaCoin allows viewers to vote on the usage of AzaCoins in the community wallet to impact the life cycle of Azarus Games on their preferred stream. To learn more about the token, head to <a href="http://azarus.io/azacoin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>azarus.io/azacoin</u></a>.</p>
<p>Viewers can head over to any Azarus-enabled streams to start playing Azarus Games alongside their favorite creators and other audience members. When they answer trivia questions correctly they will earn AzaCoins. Viewers can join the keynote stream at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20221214T070000&amp;p1=102&amp;p2=195&amp;p3=224&amp;p4=1440" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>7am UTC on Wednesday Dec. 14th</u></a> for an opportunity to win AzaCoins and learn about the token release roadmap.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Binance Pay has been available to clients in other parts of the world since February 2021.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Binance Pay is now available to US customers</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Binance</u></a>, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Tuesday, December 13th, that the Binance Pay feature is now available to its customers in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto exchange&nbsp;<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/what-is-binance-pay-d6fabc736d1f4e7fb60e56afe6d1f3b9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>explained</u></a> that Binance Pay is a contactless, borderless, and secure cryptocurrency payment technology. Binance Pay allows users to pay and get paid in crypto from their friends and family worldwide.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Pay has been available to Binance users in other parts of the world since it was launched in February 2021. At the time, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said payments is one of the most obvious use cases of cryptocurrencies. Binance stated that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Pay eliminates the complexities of transferring crypto to contacts as users no longer need to enter a complex deposit or withdrawal address, pay gas fees, or wait an unspecified amount of time for transactions to successfully settle.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Following this&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a>, Binance said its users could use the feature immediately, and the exchange is also working on a web version.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Binance is making moves to attract more users in the US</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Binance remains the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency exchange in terms of the daily trading volume. The company&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>processes over $16 billion</u></a> daily, nearly 10 times higher than what its closest competitor Coinbase is processing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto exchange has been making moves to attract more users in the United States. Binance recently eliminated trading fees for both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), a move that could help it attract more users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite that, Binance hasn&rsquo;t been without its own troubles. The United States Department of Justice is currently considering <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-ceo-zhao-could-face-criminal-charges-what-does-this-mean-for-crypto/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filing criminal charges</u></a> against Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Singapore, Singapore, 13th December, 2022, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Stader Labs</a>, a leading multi-chain liquid staking protocol, has announced that it is launching its liquid staking solution, ETHx for Ethereum. This week, Stader Labs published its <a href="https://blog.staderlabs.com/stader-x-ethereum-our-vision-5b86a3dbc575" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>vision</u></a> for Ethereum which sheds light on what to expect.</p>
<p><b>The State of Ethereum Staking<br>
</b>Firstly, a glance at the state of Ethereum staking today shows that liquid staking has emerged as the most popular way (33% of all staked eth) for users to stake Ethereum, followed by CEXs (29%). And within the liquid staking ecosystem, there&rsquo;s a dominant protocol, Lido, that has a market share of ~90%. Additionally, the problem is only made worse by Lido&rsquo;s model of working with a limited set of ~30 permissioned node operators. And, across Lido and the top 2 CEXs in Coinbase &amp; Kraken, over 50% of all staked Eth flows through just these 3 entities. This clearly highlights the need for more robust alternatives.</p>
<p><b>Stader x Ethereum: Vision<br>
</b>Stader&rsquo;s vision on Ethereum is to deliver a liquid staking product that can find the right balance of being user backward (think great UX, staking yield, Defi integrations), scalable (can support user demand), and a force for decentralization.</p>
<p>Stader&rsquo;s approach to delivering this vision will be 3-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hybrid ecosystem of permissionless and permissioned node operators with a focus on decentralization. The permissioned set will enable Stader to continue to scale as the permissionless ecosystem develops to support &nbsp;billions of dollars in staked assets</li>
<li>Lower bonding requirements for permissionless operators, fully reflecting the non-punitive nature of ETH staking design, especially for non-malicious performance issues. Plus, Stader will adopt cutting edge DVT technologies that significantly lower the risk of slashing and penalties</li>
<li>Actively developing DeFi around its soon-to-be-released liquid token, ETHx. Leveraging the experience of building Defi offerings across chains, where Stader has integrations across top Defi protocols like AAVE, Balancer, QiDAO, Beefy Finance, Venus, Apeswap and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking on the eve of the launch announcement, Amitej Gajjala, Co-founder and CEO, Stader Labs said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In line with our vision to bring staking to 1 bn users, we are happy to bring our well-loved liquid staking solution to Ethereum and add to the liquid staking diversity on ETH. Our focus will be on delivering a solution that users love, think highest staking yield, and fantastic Defi opportunities, while also furthering decentralization of Eth staking by enabling anyone to operate nodes for ETHx permissionlessly from day 1&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stader has already received grants from SSV Network, the leading distributed validator technology (DVT) provider, and here&rsquo;s what Alon Muroch, Lead developer at SSV had to share:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are excited to see Stader build on Ethereum and SSV. Stader is one of the largest liquid staking protocols, with ~110 mn $ in TVL and presence across 6 chains, and it&rsquo;s good to see them add to the liquid staking diversity on Ethereum. We are glad to partner with them on this journey and have them as early adopters of DVT. The resilience provided by DVT will enable them to be a force for decentralization on Ethereum&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>
<p>A white paper, laying out Stader&rsquo;s ETHx design, is expected in December 2022 with the mainnet launch scheduled for Q1 2023.</p>
<p><b>About Stader<br>
</b>Founded in April 2021, <a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Stader Labs</a> is a non-custodial multi-chain liquid staking platform with over USD 110 Mn+ PoS assets staked. Currently live on 6 chains (including BNB Chain, Polygon, Hedera, Fantom, Near, etc.), users can stake PoS tokens, earn staking yields, and also amplify yields across several DeFi opportunities like Aave, Balancer, etc</p>
<p>Over 25,000+ wallets have been staked with Stader. Stader is backed by notable funds including Coinbase Ventures, Pantera, Jump Crypto, Accel Partners and Accomplice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sam Bankman-Fried has been arrested in the Bahamas and faces extradition to US</li>
<li>Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison was reportedly spotted in New York</li>
<li>Former CEO Sam Trabucco resigned in August and has largely avoided the same levels of scrutiny as the other two</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, Sam.</p>
<p>Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday by the Bahamas Police Force, after the US filed criminal charges against him. The Bahamas have stated that it expects US also to request extradition imminently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a result of the notification received and the material provided therewith, it was deemed appropriate for the Attorney General to seek SBF&rsquo;s arrest and hold him in custody pursuant to our nation&rsquo;s Extradition Act,&rdquo; the statement, attributed to Attorney General Ryan Pinder, said.</p>
<p>Charges against Bankman-Fried reportedly include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering. The charges could land Bankman-Fried decades in jail. Whoops.</p>
<h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s a funky selection of charges, revealing Bankman-Fried really did do it all.</p>
<p>He was meant to testify before the House Financial Services Committee at 10AM EST today on hearing about the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-insolvent-what-next-for-crypto/">FTX crash</a>. That is no longer the case, instead, Bankman-Fried will appear in Magistrate Court in Nassau, Bahamas.</p>
<p>Once Bankman-Fried gets back on American soil, a trial won&rsquo;t happen anytime soon. This is a crime of historic scale across myriad jurisdictions, and the case will take a lot of time.</p>
<p>The SEC also made separate charges that Bankman-Freid defrauded investors.</p>
<p>We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;The alleged fraud committed by Mr. Bankman-Fried is a clarion call to crypto platforms that they need to come into compliance with our laws.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>What happens Caroline Ellison?</strong></h2>
<p>The elephant in the room is what happens to Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison. Alameda is the trading firm also founded by Bankman-Fried, and where customer funds on FTX were sent to in order to shore up large trading losses.</p>
<p>Ellison was thought to have been in Hong Kong at the time of the arrest, but she may have been spotted at a caf&eacute; in Manhattan, meaning she is already on US soil.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">PLEASE CONFIRM: A user claims that they spotted Caroline Ellison at Ground Support Coffee on West Broad in SoHo Manhattan at 8:15 AM. This would mean she is not in Hong Kong and is in NY not in custody. <a href="https://t.co/QUduYO9GfZ">pic.twitter.com/QUduYO9GfZ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Autism Capital &#129513; (@AutismCapital) <a href="https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1599466158893432832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This sparked speculation that a plea deal may have been reached, although that is all speculation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried has repeatedly denied that he had full oversight over all operations, contesting that he &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t running Alameda&rdquo; and &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t know the size of their position&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This suggests that Bankman-Fried is throwing Ellison, his former girlfriend, under the bus. Ellison has not tweeted since November 9<sup>th</sup>, with radio silence since the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>She had previously tweeted on November 6<sup>th</sup> to Binance CEO Zhao, attempting to buy the collapsing FTT tokens &ndash; the low liquidity native token of the FTX exchange that was artificially propping up the whole ecosystem &ndash; from Zhao at $22 per share (Zhao himself is also <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-ceo-zhao-could-face-criminal-charges-what-does-this-mean-for-crypto/">facing criminal charges</a> relating to a separate case).</p>
<p>Time will tell what happens to Ellison, but it seems almost impossible to believe that both Bankman-Fried and Ellison were not aware of what was happening at both their companies, given the size of the damage &ndash; $8 billion. That and the fact that that, you know, they were both CEOs of the respective entities.</p>
<h2><strong>What about Sam Trabucco?</strong></h2>
<p>Then there is the case of Sam Trabucco.</p>
<p>Trabucco is the former co-CEO of Alameda, alongside Ellison. His timing was, how should I say this, interesting. He announced his retirement less than three months before the house of cards collapsed, when Ellison became the sole CEO.</p>
<p>In an infamous tweet thread, he cited increasing work hours and a change of priorities for stepping down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reached a point in my life where I want other things. What other things? I&rsquo;m not really sure, exactly. Lately I&rsquo;ve been really happy, spending a lot of time travelling, visiting friends and family, working on &lsquo;myself&rsquo; and whatnot. Also I bought a boat, that&rsquo;s been cool&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why Trabucco is not facing scrutiny. The LUNA death spiral of May is supposedly what triggered a lot of the losses for Alameda that led to the commingling of funds from FTX. It was three months after this collapse, in August, that Trabucco resigned. As CEO, he must have known what was going on, yet is largely escaping scrutiny.</p>
<p>He also has gone silent since the bankruptcy, his final tweet from November 8<sup>th</sup> wishing that the &ldquo;road ahead is brighter&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Much love to everyone &mdash; I'm sure the past few days have been dark for many and I hope the road ahead is brighter.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sam Trabucco (@AlamedaTrabucco) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1590032437501124609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>He was also revealed to have purchased two properties worth $8.7 million in all cash last year. This is in addition to the yacht purchase mentioned above, which he reportedly hired a freelancer on Fiverr to design the logo for (he named it <em>&ldquo;Soak my Deck&rdquo;</em> apparently). &nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us not forget that he is a key figure in all this.</p>
<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>There will likely be more twists in the tale, but now that one of the three top execs are arrested, I am curious to see what will happen the other two.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s trial likely won&rsquo;t start for quite a while, and the whole thing won&rsquo;t be resolved for years. As for the other two, all bets are off, but I would be surprised if they don&rsquo;t receive a knock on their doors anytime soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Metacade is a brand-new metaverse platform that connects play-to-earn enthusiasts with exciting opportunities in the world of Web3 and GameFi. With its native MCADE token just starting its presale event, many investors are expecting big gains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project itself is well-positioned for success in Web3 and has plans for a big expansion. Metacade spans several key areas of technological advancement while offering a range of benefits to community members. In sum, Metacade has a broad value proposition that can serve countless people and avid traders are claiming the MCADE token could potentially triple in value over the coming weeks. But just how much can Metacade grow? It&rsquo;s time to take a look!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">GameFi: Pushing the Boundaries of Gaming</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The term&nbsp;<a href="https://builtin.com/blockchain/gamefi#:~:text=GameFi%2C%20a%20portmanteau%20of%20%E2%80%9Cgame%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cfinance%2C%E2%80%9D%20refers,other%20players%20or%20progressing%20through%20various%20game%20levels." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GameFi</u></a> is a combination of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; and &ldquo;finance&rdquo;, a new realm unlocked by blockchain technology. Moreover, the combination of playing and earning is made possible by sustainable liquidity generation within in-game economies. This is something that legacy games simply can&rsquo;t even begin to match.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GameFi is a rapidly growing sector of blockchain technology. Integrated marketplaces form the foundation of a fully-functioning in-game economy where users can buy and sell digital assets to access gameplay features and customisable items. It&rsquo;s also a space where players can earn while they play.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These days, we&rsquo;re seeing an increasing number of innovative developers switch to building their games on-chain. Looking ahead, it&rsquo;s only expected that the GameFi industry will grow even more. At the moment, gaming is a <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/gaming-market-105730" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>multi-billion-dollar industry</u></a> with over 3 billion individuals around the world describing themselves as a gamer. Now, they can all access titles that provide rewards in the form of digital currency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being built on the blockchain, the process of buying and selling is a natural liquidity generator for GameFi platforms. This liquidity can be used to pay players for the time they spend in-game. Whether token rewards are gained through improving their skills, progressing through levels, or beating opponents, the play-to-earn aspect is an extremely attractive proposition to gamers from all over the world.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Value of Virtual Reality</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Right now, the metaverse is a hotbed of technological development. There are a range of virtual worlds being built with some being designed for leisure and others for work. Predominantly, these are being created to house massive open-world gaming titles that fully immerse players in sensational digital environments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain gaming and the metaverse go hand-in-hand. Self-owned digital assets provide a greater level of user control and the metaverse itself provides users with a never-before-possible level of immersion. These characteristics combine to create almost life-like landscapes where players can explore, adventure, and &ndash; thanks to blockchain technology &ndash; earn.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One project that looks set to dominate this future domain is <a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a>. The Metacade platform is building a sprawling metaverse that offers a range of arcade-style play-to-earn games alongside some unique benefits. The project is inherently community-driven, aiming to provide a host of useful services that can help to expand the world of GameFi and Web3.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What exactly is Metacade (MCADE)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is a Web3 platform that&rsquo;s positioned to be the one-stop space for P2E and Web3 gaming. Think of it as a sort of online arcade for crypto enthusiasts. Of course, instead of having just one game title, Metacade is going to host a whole range of games. And more excitingly, some of those games will be planned and developed by Metacade users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to offering a range of play-to-earn titles within Metacade, the project offers some unique earning opportunities to users. Metacade aims to encourage the continued growth of the GameFi sector by incentivising a community-centric approach to tackling the latest play-to-earn games.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Simply put, users can share their knowledge of their favourite games, such as tips on how to improve performance or how to maximise earning potential. Then, Metacade will reward users for sharing and engaging with the community.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Special roles in GameFi</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Metacade community also gains access to some unique job opportunities. Some of the best up-and-coming GameFi games will advertise testing roles within the Metacade metaverse, looking for GameFi enthusiasts and Web3 natives to look for bugs and provide feedback.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This will be an amazing opportunity to access the hottest games before they officially go live. The Metacade community can play these titles and earn MCADE tokens as a reward for the service they provide to the game development teams.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Boosting innovation</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade has also incorporated a feature that will allow the best innovators in GameFi to launch their creations into the world of Web3. Funding is an integral aspect of the development process. For games to reach their full potential, and fully deliver on the baseline ideas that gamers want to see, then early-stage funding is crucial.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Metagrants program has been designed to help game developers in this process. Community members will decide which game proposals they&rsquo;d most like to see developed and can vote for one winner to receive the grant as part of the program. In this way, the Metacade community will directly influence the future of the GameFi industry as they get to form early relationships with innovative developers and lend a helping hand during the development process.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why does Metacade (MCADE) have such high potential in particular?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">At the moment, the MCADE token is underpriced &ndash; significantly underpriced. The token has just started its presale, so early investors have a prime opportunity to make some major gains as the ground-breaking metaverse world continually grows.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project has taken a strong position at the intersection of technology sectors that are constantly expanding. Between 2016 and 2021, the total number of crypto holders grew from less than 5 million to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202503/global-cryptocurrency-user-base/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>almost 300 million</u></a>. That&rsquo;s a 59X increase in just 5 years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During that time, the industry has seen major technological improvements in some key areas. dApp ecosystems such as Ethereum and Solana have improved transaction speeds, which massively favours the future of Web3. Metacade looks to serve Web3 users in a number of key ways, connecting the community and providing crypto rewards in the process.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MCADE Price Prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With so many amazing features on offer, the Metacade project looks set to be a major player in the metaverse. Whether being discussed in terms of innovative decentralised applications (<a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-decentralized-applications-dapps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dApps</u></a>), pushing forward technological development through the metaverse, or in terms of providing exclusive earning opportunities to gamers with a selection of arcade-style games, the Metacade project is truly expansive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since the MCADE token is only just starting its presale, crypto investors everywhere are keen to get involved. Expert traders are expecting between 100% and 200% gains with some saying it could go even higher than that. One thing is for certain, the MCADE token is currently underpriced and it&rsquo;s being released for just $0.008 per token during the presale. With all the value being offered, it may rival the biggest GameFi platforms the world over in the coming years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> (MCADE) is an up-and-coming Web3 gaming ecosystem that is set to rival many existing metaverse projects, including Decentraland (MANA). </p>
<p dir="ltr">With multiple metaverses vying for attention, it can take time to pinpoint which ones really stand out from the crowd. But certain projects, such as Metacade, are making great strides towards doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade could play a key role in offering gamers access to Web3 and is different from what is offered by metaverse projects such as Decentraland.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Decentraland Metaverse Explored</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-decentraland-mana" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Decentraland</u></a> is an Ethereum-powered virtual reality platform where you buy land that you can traverse, build on, and make money from. The digital assets that spaces are made of in Decentraland are LAND NFTs, which cannot be replaced or duplicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On your own LAND, you can design games, apps, gambling platforms, or even three-dimensional scenes. You can also develop LAND-based services for sectors like education and tourism. Each LAND plot is 33&times;33 feet but there is no set height limit. Decentraland also created LAND estates so you can manage your property more easily by connecting plots of land.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is essentially the core of the Decentraland metaverse project. It is a property-based system that you purchase and build upon &ndash; real estate in a virtual setting.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Issues With Virtual Real Estate Platforms</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The issue with virtual real estate platforms is that they are created exclusively for monetization. Certain plots of virtual land (which are NFTs tied to a given blockchain) are being bought for millions of dollars by wealthy real estate companies. A virtual piece of land within Decentraland sold for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/virtual-real-estate-plot-sells-record-24-million-2021-11-23/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2.4 million</u></a>, which is quite a large figure. But there is little evidence that such purchases are tied to any real, intrinsic value.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most owners are planning to monetize on these metaverse projects but without delivering much in the way of valuable ideas on how to do so. It&rsquo;s likely we&rsquo;ll see the metaverse filled with billboards of Mcdonald&rsquo;s and Coca-Cola &ndash; and who honestly wants that? Advertising is an important element in marketing but it can&rsquo;t be the sole use case or the prime reason for investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metaverse projects should aim to give back to network participants in a fair manner and need to have built-in reward mechanisms. Otherwise, growth is artificial with poor prospects for &nbsp;metaverse projects lasting over the long term.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Metacade Metaverse Project: Setting Itself Apart</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is setting itself apart from the competition in multiple ways. For one thing, it does not simply offer plots of land. It&rsquo;s an online arcade where users can select one of many games to play and earn income from playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s also an entire ecosystem, not merely a place to buy things. It&rsquo;s a place for Web3 gamers to connect with one another, play games, stake tokens, and earn income without &lsquo;flipping&rsquo; a virtual piece of land. Metacade will have job listings for game-related roles, as well as beta testing opportunities and social features.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade offers many ways to make revenue, all of which are organic revenue because it relates to activity. Community members are rewarded for their contributions: from sharing ideas to posting reviews and testing new games, everyone is compensated for their support. It&rsquo;s not merely purchasing a piece of land and waiting for it to appreciate in value. It is setting out to become a vibrant and comprehensive ecosystem for Web3 gamers.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The gaming platform will ultimately transition into a DAO (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-dao/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decentralised autonomous organisation</u></a>) at a future date to ensure that decision-making is democratic and that the gaming community can shape Metacade in exactly the ways they would like.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Metacade Metaverse: Different In Many Ways</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Decentraland is a single game while Metacade offers a myriad of different games to play and will continually be adding to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is a gaming ecosystem where participants can find jobs, network, communicate, and invest in new projects, while Decentraland is focused on virtual land development. Put simply, Metacade is an entire gaming ecosystem with no end to growth potential, while Decentraland is only a game for virtual land development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The majority of metaverses are currently overpriced and a little saturated. Axie Infinity, Decentraland, and the Sandbox appear to be places where wealthy individuals and organisations purchase NFTs but outside of that there is little else on offer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, Metacade gives back to Web3 gamers in many ways. It&rsquo;s easy to earn rewards on the platform simply by engaging with the community and staking tokens. It&rsquo;s built by gamers, for gamers, and will also be ultimately governed by gamers. Metacade is truly dedicated to its community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade also sets itself apart by virtue of being in its presale stage and is only just getting started, which could indicate an improved upside price. Currently, they are offering 125MCADE for $1 ($0.008 per token). By the final stage of the presale, this price will have gone up to over $0.02 per token &ndash; more than double the price.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By offering a comprehensive gaming ecosystem for Web3 and with an opportunity to get in early, Metacade presents itself as a serious value proposition. Offering far more than previous metaverse projects and with the potential to have great influence over the next generation of P2E, it&rsquo;s well worth checking out.</p>
