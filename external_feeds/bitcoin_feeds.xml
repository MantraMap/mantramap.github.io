The billionaire&#8217;s comments followed the collapse of crypto exchange FTX which wiped out billions of dollars of customer funds.</strong></p>
<h2>Mark Cuban on the Next Crypto Implosion</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, shared his thoughts on the next crypto implosion with The Street, published Friday. The billionaire said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the next possible implosion is the discovery and removal of wash trades on central exchanges.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There are supposedly tens of millions of dollars in trades and liquidity for tokens that have very little utilization,&#8221; Cuban emphasized. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how they can be that liquid.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the Shark Tank star admitted: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any specifics to offer to support my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wash trading has long been a concern with cryptocurrency exchanges attempting to inflate their trading volumes. Wash trades are among the manipulative practices prohibited by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and regulators worldwide are increasingly cracking down on wash trading involving cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">Kim Grauer, director of research at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, said in September last year that wash trading in the crypto space is currently &#8220;a legal gray area that we&#8217;re all trying to figure out how this should be regulated and what&#8217;s illegal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The crypto industry is also suffering from the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which filed for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">bankruptcy</a> in November. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has been charged with multiple counts of fraud. However, he has pleaded not guilty to those charges.</p>
<p>Cuban said in November that if he were Bankman-Fried, he would &#8220;be afraid of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mark-cuban-if-i-were-sam-bankman-fried-id-be-afraid-of-going-to-jail-for-a-long-time/">going to jail</a> for a long time.&#8221; He stressed: &#8220;It sure sounds bad.&#8221; The billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mark-cuban-says-ftx-implosion-isnt-crypto-blowup-explains-why-he-invests-in-crypto/">explained</a> that recent blowups in the crypto space, including the FTX implosion, were &#8220;banking blowups,&#8221; rather than &#8220;crypto blowups.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Shark Tank star believes that bitcoin is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mark-cuban-bitcoin-is-a-good-investment-gold-investors-are-dumb/">a good investment</a>; he called gold investors &#8220;dumb.&#8221; He also revealed that he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mark-cuban-says-ftx-implosion-isnt-crypto-blowup-explains-why-he-invests-in-crypto/">invests in crypto</a> because he expects smart contracts to &#8220;have a significant impact in creating valuable applications.&#8221;</p>

He does not expect the FTX contagion to spread far beyond the crypto space. </strong></p>
<h2>Alan Greenspan on Crypto, FTX, and US Economy</h2>
<p>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan shared his views on cryptocurrency, the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, and the U.S. economy in a year-end Q&amp;A published by Advisors Capital Management this week.</p>
<p>Greenspan served five terms as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 1987 to 2006. He was appointed chairman by four different U.S. presidents. He joined Advisors Capital Management in September 2016 as Economic Advisor to the asset management firm.</p>
<p>The former Fed chair was asked to comment on the FTX meltdown and whether he expects contagion from it. &#8220;I do not expect the fallout from FTX to spread beyond the cryptocurrency/NFT [non-fungible token] space,&#8221; Greenspan replied, citing &#8220;the information that has come to light so far.&#8221; He stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The collapse of FTX was not a result of lax risk management, inadequate accounting procedures, or some feature inherent to crypto — it was purely fraud.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately, although FTX and firms like it have increased marketing of their products in recent years, the lack of any noticeable widespread market reaction to FTX suggests that they are still fairly concentrated in the hands of a relatively small subset of investors,&#8221; Greenspan described.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, the differences we observed in the aftermaths of the popping of the tech bubble and the popping of the housing bubble showed clearly that credit-fueled asset bubbles create far more contagion when they ultimately deflate,&#8221; he opined. &#8220;There does not appear to be a significant amount of leverage dedicated to the cryptocurrency/NFT space at this time, so I do not expect contagion to spread very far beyond this particular asset class.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former Federal Reserve chief added:</p>
<blockquote><p>With respect to the wider crypto universe, I view the asset class as too dependent on the &#8216;greater fool theory&#8217; to be a desirable investment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Greenspan also shared his view on the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s fight against inflation. Commenting on whether a recession is required to bring down inflation as some economists have suggested, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>A recession does appear to be the most likely outcome at this time.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, he does not believe &#8220;a Fed reversal that is substantial enough to avoid at least a mild recession&#8221; is warranted. &#8220;Wage increases, and by extension employment, still need to soften further for a pullback in inflation to be anything more than transitory. So, we may have a brief period of calm on the inflation front but I think it will be too little too late,&#8221; Greenspan concluded.</p>

Expecting the SEC &#8220;to sweep everything,&#8221; Cramer urges investors to &#8220;get out&#8221; of crypto now.</strong></p>
<h2>Jim Cramer&#8217;s Latest Crypto Warnings</h2>
<p>The host of CNBC&#8217;s Mad Money show, Jim Cramer, is back with more warnings for crypto investors. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who co-founded Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-regulators-and-the-fed-jointly-issue-crypto-warnings/">joint statement</a> about crypto risks by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Cramer said on CNBC Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think these statements are the beginning of what I have been calling for, which is that the SEC is going to do a roundup of all of the ones [crypto firms] who are not compliant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Citing John Stark, who served as an attorney for over 18 years in the SEC&#8217;s Enforcement Division, Cramer stressed that Stark is &#8220;now calling for a sweep.&#8221; The Mad Money host emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>He said the SEC is going to sweep everything, which is why I am telling everybody: get out of these.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I see a lot of people feel, like John Stark, that it&#8217;s just a giant scam,&#8221; Cramer continued. He added that he expects former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to be material to the SEC roundup.</p>

<p>Cramer clarified:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not calling for a crypto collapse. I&#8217;m calling for a collapse of the people in on the Ponzi scheme.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the warning signs, Cramer explained that &#8220;people are bidding&#8221; the prices of cryptocurrencies up. He proceeded to warn investors to get their money out of crypto while they can.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-money-jim-cramer-buys-bitcoin-strategy-to-increase-holdings/" target="_self" rel="noopener">used to invest</a> in bitcoin, ether, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-dumps-bitcoin-china-mining-crackdown-ransomware/" target="_self" rel="noopener">sold</a> all his crypto holdings last year. He has been advising investors to avoid <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-recommends-avoiding-crypto-other-speculative-investments/" target="_self" rel="noopener">investing in speculative assets</a>, including crypto, while the Federal Reserve continues to tighten the economy. Earlier this month, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-advises-investors-to-get-out-of-crypto-says-its-never-too-late-to-sell/" target="_self" rel="noopener">advised</a> investors to get out of crypto, emphasizing that it is never too late to exit &#8220;an awful position.&#8221; He also said he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-urges-sec-to-do-a-big-crypto-sweep-says-i-wouldnt-touch-crypto-in-a-million-years/">would not touch crypto</a> in a million years.</p>
<p>Regarding why the price of bitcoin is so resilient at the high $16K level, Cramer said Friday: &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what Stark said. Because it&#8217;s phony and a scam.&#8221; The Mad Money host concluded that crypto prices are &#8220;being propped up by people who want them propped up, and that&#8217;s all there is.&#8221;</p>

On Friday, Wyre stated that it is now &#8220;exploring strategic options.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Industry Turmoil: Wyre Modifies Withdrawal Policy, Topps Suspends NFT Marketplace Transactions</h2>
<p>Three days ago on Jan. 4, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-firm-wyre-reportedly-shuts-down-after-canceled-bolt-acquisition-ceo-claims-firm-is-just-scaling-back-operations/">reported</a> that crypto payments firm Wyre was closing its operations. The news followed the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-firm-bolt-scraps-deal-to-acquire-crypto-company-wyre/">failure</a> of the <a href="http://bolt/">$1.5 billion Bolt acquisition deal </a>and the departure of co-founder Michael Dunworth, stepping down from his role at the company. On Jan. 6, Wyre published an update for the community addressing speculation about the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not been immune to the challenges of the current macroeconomic climate and the recent events that have shaken the crypto industry,&#8221; Wyre <a href="https://blog.sendwyre.com/wyre-update-to-the-community-69e5fd1a8ecf">explained</a> on Friday. Additionally, the company has changed its management structure, with Ioannis Giannaros becoming executive chairman and Stephen Cheng serving as interim CEO. In its update, Wyre also announced changes to withdrawals, stating that users are now limited in the amount they can withdraw.</p>
<p>“We are modifying our withdrawal policy. While customers will continue to be able to withdraw their funds, at this time, we are limiting withdrawals to no more than 90% of the funds currently in each customer account, subject to current daily limits,” Wyre’s update details, noting that “This will best position us to serve and maximize value for our customers and stakeholders.”</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>The Wyre withdrawal issue has affected other parts of the crypto industry, as collectibles and candy company Topps emailed customers about the incident and its impact on its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. “You may have seen reports that Wyre, a wallet service provider for our secondary marketplace, may be shutting down or scaling back operations,” the Topps email details. “We have been assessing the situation and, as of today, Wyre released an official statement.” Topps added:</p>
<blockquote><p>In light of this and as a precautionary measure, we are temporarily suspending transactions in the shop and marketplace effective immediately. Rest assured that your collection continues to be safe and secure.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the second half of 2022, crypto blowouts and failures created a contagion that spread to nearly every corner of the ecosystem. Last year, several crypto firms that were thought to be reliable became insolvent. It seems 2023 won&#8217;t be able to escape the bad news either.</p>

Russia’s central bank revealed two weeks ago that it is further distancing itself from U.S. dollar dependence by purchasing the Chinese yuan on foreign exchange markets. Roughly around the same time, on Dec. 21, 2022, Sberbank executive and Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) member, Yaroslav Lissovolik, published an opinion article that talks about exploring the pathway toward a new BRICS reserve currency.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia&#8217;s Central Bank Seeks to Reduce Dependency on US Dollar with Purchase of Chinese Yuan</h2>
<p>At the end of July, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/targeting-the-us-dollars-hegemony-russia-china-and-brics-nations-plan-to-craft-a-new-international-reserve-currency/">reported</a> on the BRICS nations&#8217; plan to craft a new reserve currency after Russian president Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/557627-brics-developing-global-reserve-currency/">announced</a> the plan amid the BRICS Summit in June. While the subject was topical at the time, people stopped discussing the BRICS reserve currency for a while. A few months later, in October 2022, the author of the best-selling book Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-us-dollar-is-toast-citing-saudi-arabias-request-to-join-brics/">discussed</a> the subject and noted that the U.S. dollar is &#8220;toast.&#8221; Over the last 30 days, energy prices and commodities have subsided in value, but some economists expect a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/oil-prices-north-of-200-per-barrel-investor-expects-oil-to-crush-every-investment-in-2023/">$200-per-barrel run-up</a> in oil prices at some point in 2023.</p>

<p>While energy and commodity values have dropped, Russia&#8217;s ruble has dropped against the greenback as well. Statistics show that the ruble has lost 16.48% against the U.S. dollar in 30 days, but five-day metrics show the ruble is up 1.72%. Year-to-date statistics show the Russian currency has <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/RUB-USD?window=1Y">increased 5.37%</a> over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, at the end of December 2022, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/russia-likely-buy-yuan-fx-market-2023-sources-2022-12-22/">reported</a> that Russia will be making Chinese yuan purchases on the currency market in 2023. Reporter Elena Fabrichnaya said Moscow&#8217;s move was cited by two sources and it opens a &#8220;new front in an accelerating de-dollarization drive designed to reduce its dependency on Western finance.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Sberbank Analyst Discusses Possibility of a BRICS Reserve Currency Complementing National Currencies</h2>
<p>The previous day, on Dec. 21, 2022, Yaroslav Lissovolik, a member of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) and head of the analytical department at Sberbank, published a <a href="https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/12/21/a-brics-reserve-currency-exploring-the-pathways/">blog post</a> titled &#8220;Exploring the Pathways,&#8221; discussing the proposed BRICS reserve currency. Lissovolik said the “BRICS reserve currency has taken on particular significance in recent months” following Russian president Putin’s remarks at the BRICS Summit. The analyst detailed that there’s also been recent legislation and debates concerning the “expediency of creating a new reserve currency.”</p>
<p>Lissovolik cited the most <a href="http://council.gov.ru/en/events/news/138204/">recent discussion</a> about the BRICS reserve currency at the Eighth BRICS Parliamentary Forum. At the event, Federation Assembly Speaker Valentina Matvienko suggested that BRICS legislators start to move forward on concrete measures that bolster the countries&#8217; economies. Matvienko singled out specific initiatives, including the new international reserve currency and developing better settlement procedures within the BRICS nations. Lissovolik&#8217;s blog post also compared the new BRICS reserve currency idea to the 2018 Valdai Club concept of the <a href="https://eng.globalaffairs.ru/articles/boosting-the-use-of-national-currencies-among-brics/">R5 currency</a>, a name that signifies the letter &#8220;R&#8221; for the five currencies: the real, ruble, rupee, renminbi, and rand.</p>

<p>Lissovolik detailed that a new BRICS reserve currency won&#8217;t be created to replace the national reserve currencies used by each of the nations, but rather to &#8220;complement these national currencies.&#8221; The Sberbank analyst said a brand new reserve currency could have a &#8220;transformational effect on the international financial system,&#8221; as he believes there&#8217;s a &#8220;notable shortage of reserve currencies&#8221; in the global economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Importantly, the scope for employing the new reserve currency in the world economy is sizeable given the tremendous potential for de-dollarization,&#8221; Lissovolik&#8217;s blog post concludes. &#8220;The new BRICS reserve currency can act in concert with the stronger role performed by BRICS national currencies to take on a greater share of the total pie of currency transactions in the world economy.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Report Claims Digital Currency Group, Genesis Global Capital Allegedly Face Scrutiny from Federal Prosecutors in New York</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/geminis-cameron-winklevoss-insists-digital-currency-group-needs-to-resolve-liquidity-issues-in-open-letter-to-ceo-barry-silbert/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent letter</span></a> from Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini, Digital Currency Group (DCG) has until Jan. 8, 2023, to resolve liquidity issues between Gemini and the lending unit of Genesis Global Capital. It has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-owes-gemini-customers-900-million-exchange-is-attempting-to-recoup-assets/">reported</a> that Genesis owes $900 million to Gemini Earn customers and both companies&#8217; lending arms have halted withdrawals since mid-Nov. 2022.</p>
<p>Reports have disclosed that Genesis was impacted severely by the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research and Gemini has recently been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-28/gemini-winklevoss-twins-sued-for-fraud-over-interest-accounts">informed</a> that it may face a potential class-action lawsuit over the matter. Bloomberg states that federal investigators are getting involved and are reportedly looking into transactions between Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Genesis. &#8220;People familiar with the matter,&#8221; who requested anonymity, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-07/crypto-empire-dcg-faces-us-investigation-over-internal-transfers?leadSource=uverify%20wall">told</a> the publication that prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are investigating the issue.</p>
<p>Bloomberg requested a comment from Silbert and a Digital Currency Group (DCG) spokesperson responded. &#8220;DCG has a strong culture of integrity and has always conducted its business lawfully. We have no knowledge of or reason to believe that there is any Eastern District of New York investigation into DCG,&#8221; the company spokesperson said in a statement. The news outlet also reported that &#8220;the SEC and US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bloomberg editorial follows a series of reports about alleged probes by U.S. authorities into crypto firms that have either resulted in enforcement, never materialized, or have yet to come to fruition. In the past 12 months, reports citing &#8220;people familiar with the matter&#8221; have stated that U.S. investigators are probing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-sec-heightens-probe-into-auditors-servicing-crypto-exchanges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto reserve auditors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-irs-may-get-approved-to-conduct-coinbase-tax-probe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. taxpayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-bankrupt-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-probed-by-sec-cftc-for-possible-legal-violations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Arrows Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-probes-twitter-over-spam-accounts-court-orders-the-social-media-giant-to-provide-additional-data-to-elon-musk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-reportedly-facing-sec-probe-for-listing-unregistered-securities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-probes-binance-bnb-could-be-unregistered-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-allegedly-probes-operators-behind-worlds-largest-decentralized-exchange-uniswap-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniswap</span></a>, among others.</p>

The network recorded a milestone of around 361.20 exahash per second (EH/s) on Friday, jumping more than 4% higher than the previous record of 347.16 EH/s recorded on Nov. 12, 2022.</strong></p>
<h2>Network&#x2019;s Hashpower Surges to New Heights, Difficulty Change Anticipated in Eight Days</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#x2019;s computational power is running hot during the first week of the new year as it broke its first record in 2023. According to statistics on Jan. 7, Bitcoin&#x2019;s hashrate is currently coasting along at 290 EH/s after reaching its all-time high (ATH) the day prior. The ATH occurred on Jan. 6 at 3:42 p.m. ET at block height 770,709, when the network&#x2019;s total hashpower reached <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">361.20 EH/s</a>. This record equates to 0.3611999 zettahash per second (ZH/s) or roughly 361.2 quintillion hashes per second.</p>

<p>The Jan. 6 record was more than 4% higher than the Nov. 12, 2022 record of around 347.16 EH/s, printed at block height 762,845. Because the hashrate has been so high, block generation times have been much faster than the 10-minute average. Statistics show that current block intervals (the time between mined blocks) have been between <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">8:51</a> and <a href="https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/bitcoin-halving-countdown/">7:31</a> minutes. Data also shows that the cost of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> production has dropped. <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost">Metrics</a> from macromicro.me indicate that the cost of bitcoin production is $16,568 per unit, while the spot price is $16,920 per unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://theminermag.com/company">Statistics</a> from theminermag.com show that the cost of bitcoin production might even be much lower, as the web portal shows the average cost at around $13.6K per unit. The faster block intervals will likely mean that the network&#x2019;s difficulty will rise on or around Jan. 16, 2023, after a <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">3.59% decrease</a> on the second day of the year. Current estimates for the difficulty change in more than eight days range from <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">7.04%</a> to a record-setting <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">13.2% increase</a>. On Oct. 10, 2022, there was a 13.55% increase, which was the largest upswing of the year.</p>

<p>On Jan. 7, 2023, <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">three-day statistics</a> show that Foundry USA is the top mining pool with 29.34% of the world&#x2019;s total hashrate, or roughly 78.85 EH/s of hashpower. Foundry is followed by Antpool (20.04%), F2pool (16.74%), Viabtc (9.71%), and Binance Pool (7.85%), respectively. The processing power of the network reaching record highs suggests that Bitcoin&#x2019;s blockchain is becoming more powerful, which is seen as a positive sign for the overall health of the Bitcoin network. However, as mentioned above, it can also have an impact on the difficulty of mining new blocks after the difficulty changes on Jan. 16 in eight days.</p>

The move saw the token climb by as much as 12%, breaking out of a key resistance level in the process. Polygon also moved higher, as it raced towards a recent price ceiling. </strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum Classic (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" 312035  target="_blank">ETC</a>)</h2>
<p>Ethereum classic (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" 312035  target="_blank">ETC</a>) rose to a six-week high on Saturday, as prices rallied by as much as 14%.</p>
<p>Following a low of $17.94 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" 312035  target="_blank">ETC</a>/USD raced to a peak of $20.68 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETC" 312035  target="_blank">ETC</a> broke out of a key resistance level of $20.00, hitting its highest point since November 26 in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s surge came as the 10-day (red) moving average crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Recent rallies have also pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) close to overbought territory, with the indicator tracking at its highest point since last August.</p>
<p>Earlier gains have already begun to fade, with previous bulls likely moving to take profit at the level.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) was another notable gainer to start the weekend, with the token climbing for a second straight day.</p>
<p>MATIC/USD raced to a high of $0.8105, which is over 3% higher than Friday&#x2019;s low at the $0.774 mark.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s gain has pushed polygon closer to a key resistance level of $0.8200, which was last hit on December 27.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, today&#x2019;s surge has also led to a collision with a ceiling on the RSI, with the index hitting its resistance of 49.00</p>
<p>Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, and as of writing, MATIC/USD is trading at the $0.8039 point.</p>
<p>In order for MATIC to extend recent gains to a third session, price strength will first need to overcome the 49.00 ceiling on the RSI.</p>

December&#x2019;s payrolls came in at 223,000, which was better than the 200,000 markets had expected. Ethereum was also higher on Saturday, with prices nearing a three-week high.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved closer to the $17,000 level on Saturday, as traders continued to react to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP).</p>
<p>Last month&#x2019;s NFP numbers came in at 223,000, which is 23,000 higher than expected, and this was in a month where the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by less than in previous months.</p>
<p>In response to this, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD surged to a peak of $16,991.99 to start the weekend, hovering close to a three-week high in the process.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, today&#x2019;s rally came as the 10-day (red) moving average closed in on a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>This, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rallied, climbing above a key resistance point at 50.00</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 52.24, with the next visible ceiling at the 55.00 mark, which is likely where bulls are targeting.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved higher to start the weekend, with prices moving gradually closer to $1,300.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,240.95, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $1,273.22, which is its highest point since December 17.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s move comes as an upwards crossover of moving averages has recently occurred, with the 10-day (red) trend line moving higher versus the 25-day (blue) line.</p>

<p>Typically such a move is a sign of current and future bullish momentum, and this could likely tempt more bulls to re-enter the market.</p>
<p>The next target will undoubtedly be the aforementioned $1,300 ceiling, which will likely be hit once the RSI climbs past its current ceiling at 59.00.</p>

A surcharge introduced in 2021 now depends on the price of electricity consumed by bitcoin farms and can be much higher than the original levy.</strong></p>
<h2>New Year Brings Higher Costs for Companies Mining Crypto in Kazakhstan</h2>
<p>Starting from Jan. 1, an electricity fee imposed on crypto miners in Kazakhstan is being calculated according to a progressive scale. The initial universal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kazakhstan-introduces-surcharge-for-electricity-used-by-crypto-miners/">surcharge</a> of 1 Kazakhstani tenge ($0.002) per kilowatt-hour (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kWh</a>), first adopted in the summer of 2021, can now reach 25 tenge (over $0.05).</p>
<p>The rate in each case depends on the source and price of electrical energy used to extract digital currencies. The new mechanism to determine the tariff was introduced with a bill amending the country’s Tax Code which President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kazakhstan-president-signs-law-increasing-tax-burden-for-crypto-miners/">signed</a> into law in July 2022.</p>
<p>The base for the levy is the average price of electricity consumed by a miner during a given tax period. If a company paid 24 tenge or more per kWh, the minimum fee of 1 tenge would be charged, as per the latest tariff scale quoted by Interfax Kazakhstan and other local media.</p>
<p>The lowest rate will also be offered to crypto farms using renewable energy, not taking into account the cost of the electricity. And for energy produced from other sources — the cheaper the power utilized, the heavier the tax burden. The fee can go up to 25 tenge per kWh, the reports detail.</p>

<p>Kazakhstan became a mining hotspot after China’s crackdown on the industry in 2021, attracting crypto miners with its low, subsidized electricity rates. The influx of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/canaan-expands-mining-operations-in-kazakhstan-amid-power-deficit-protests/">mining companies</a> has been blamed for the country’s growing power deficit.</p>
<p>The authorities in Nur-Sultan have been going after unauthorized mining farms and taking steps to more comprehensively regulate the sector. A provision in a new bill <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-miners-in-kazakhstan-to-buy-only-surplus-power-under-digital-assets-bill/">adopted</a> by Kazakhstan’s parliament in December aims to oblige miners to buy surplus electricity on a government-controlled market.</p>
<p>An earlier legislative proposal, which was submitted by a group of lawmakers in October, limits mining to only registered firms. It also allows non-resident entities to mine in the country as long as they have agreements with locally licensed data centers.</p>
