<h2>Meme Cryptocurrencies Gain $759M in a Month, Led by Dogecoin</h2>
<p>As of Sunday, July 23, 2023, the meme coin economy is valued at $16.29 billion, up from $15.54 billion a month earlier on June 22. This indicates a gain of more than $759 million, or 4.82%, against the U.S. dollar in the top meme coin economy.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 days, dogecoin has increased by more than 10% and has risen 1.3% against the U.S. dollar this past week. With a market valuation of $10.12 billion, Dogecoin represents 62.12% of the total value of the meme coin economy.</p>

<p>SHIB has increased 1% against the U.S. dollar over the past month, though seven-day statistics show a loss of 2.7% this past week. With a market valuation of $4.61 billion, SHIB accounts for 28.29% of the net value of the meme coin economy. Combined with Dogecoin, these two coins dominate 90.41% of the meme coin economy.</p>

<p>Pepe (PEPE), the third largest meme coin asset, rose 1.6% over the past month. However, in the past week, PEPE&#8217;s value has decreased by 7.6%. With a market valuation of $628 million, PEPE represents 3.85% of the net value of the meme coin economy.</p>
<p>In the past 24 hours, the meme coin economy has seen $528 million in global trade volume. The top three performers on Sunday were kabosu inu (KABOSU), 3d3d (3D3D), and pepemon pepeballs (PPBLZ), which gained between 9.9% and 210% respectively.</p>
<p>The three largest decliners against the U.S. dollar in the meme coin assets were shibaken finance (SHIBAKEN), cheems inu (CINU), and dingocoin (DINGO), losing between 7% and 22% over the past day. Regarding 24-hour volume, DOGE leads, followed by SHIB and PEPE, while FLOKI takes the fourth position this weekend.</p>

Statistics indicate that miners have accrued roughly 1,847.66 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in fees, worth about $55.29 million, confirming the millions of Ordinal inscriptions.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin&#x2019;s Ordinal Inscriptions Near 19 Million</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As of July 22, 2023, at block height 799,830, approximately <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/0a5f730e98a480664803a1c1ea8ed4ee6f1510e854e6554794961f25e471eabfi0">18,599,837</a> Ordinal inscriptions have been issued on the bitcoin blockchain. The trend has continued to rise since the first inscription 218 days ago. <a href="https://archive.ph/YBS8w">Archived statistics</a> from Dune Analytics indicate that 78.5% of all the inscriptions minted on Bitcoin are in plain text form or character sets, while another 13.5% is plain text, bringing the total of plain text and character set inscriptions to 92%. The remainder of the inscriptions consist of images, GIF files, animations, applications, and more.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The largest number of daily <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2008613/3324931">Ordinal inscriptions</a> occurred on May 7, 2023, with 400,091 inscriptions. July 9 saw 385,920, July 16 recorded 385,604 and July 18 saw 323,964 inscriptions. In addition to daily ordinal inscriptions, the number of <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2145510/3518071">inscriptions per block</a> has significantly increased in July. A few blocks, including block height 797,976 and block height 798,795, confirmed more than 5,000 inscriptions. While <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2123547/3489157">fees from Ordinals</a> experienced their largest increase on May 7 and 8, they have stagnated since then.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Data indicates that people are paying less to confirm approximately the same number of inscriptions as they did in May, despite the continuing drive to inscribe. The higher fees, however, are absent. At block height 799,832 on July 22, there are more than <a href="https://archive.ph/gGHe9">300,000 unconfirmed transactions</a> on the bitcoin blockchain. While a low-priority transaction will cost 71 cents, a high-priority transaction will cost the sender around $1.88 or 0.000063 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Both financial transactions and Ordinal inscriptions together contribute to the backlog of transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">Metrics</a> recorded by cryptoslam.io show that in the past 30 days, $98.85 million in nonfungible token (NFT) sales were recorded. Over the past month, the bitcoin blockchain has the second highest number of sales among 22 different blockchain networks, but sales are more than 13% lower than the previous month. Only two bitcoin-based NFT collections are among the top 10 in terms of 30-day sales. The bitcoin collection, known as <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/uncategorized-ordinals">Uncategorized Ordinals</a>, was the second largest in terms of the past month&#x2019;s sales, with $41 million.</p>

<h2>Long-dormant Bitcoin Address Springs to Life, Moving $30 Million Hoard</h2>
<p>July has seen eight so-called &#x2018;sleeping&#x2019; bitcoin wallets, untouched since 2012, break their over 11-year hibernation, initiating transactions for the first time. A total of approximately 1,216.92 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, which had remained in a state of inertia for the past decade, were shifted this month. The prior seven instances of bitcoin activity from 2012, involving dormant wallets, totaled 179.50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> before the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1MchKSZg4ETtfxJdhNXrDxg3hp9UAiNZ96">slumbering whale address</a> moved a colossal 1,037.42 bitcoins on Saturday.</p>
<p>The recipient address of the 1,037.42 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> first acquired the coins on <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/a11a3c20c548123e26aca05beb42d7171442d3351d64859b2e88b87c8d2f4411">April 11, 2012</a>, with the digital currency remaining untouched ever since. On this acquisition date, a single <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded at a mere $4.84, valuing the entire hoard at a modest $5,021. The trove of 1,037 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was dispatched at block height 799,701 on July 22, destined for this <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qtl80rmdpe2v662v4552x55wh7wwmss8w8lfx0y">specific address</a>. After this transaction, the owner injected a minuscule 0.00000546 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> into the wallet, then subsequently transferred the balance, a slightly reduced 1,037.4189247 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>The initial transaction was <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1MchKSZg4ETtfxJdhNXrDxg3hp9UAiNZ96">flagged</a> by btcparser.com and was executed with minimal concealment. Blockchair.com&#x2019;s privacy tool assigned a dismal score of <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/privacy-o-meter/6a5467b7e5926756ba558402eadb0d97357e47db22f93dd213bbefece02f2c1d">zero out of 100</a> to the transaction. Such a low privacy rating is classified as &#x201C;critical,&#x201D; indicating the transfer was plagued by three significant privacy flaws. These shortcomings include the identification of &#x201C;matched addresses.&#x201D; The &#x201C;critical&#x201D; score implies that the &#x201C;identified issues are significantly endangering the privacy of the parties involved.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Alongside the 1,216.92 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dispatched from dormant bitcoin addresses dating back to 2012 this month, there were also three transactions (<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1LKsQSQQsGT4Fhp5PbvmCugWd9heipypKz">1</a>,<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/13gfPHStgixjzu1vMfhwuitp3Kk65RVGbP">2</a>,<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/18FK98EcD5Fb72LLzHfDEoyjSCf4q1XD3K">3</a>) from 2011. Two of these 2011 transfers occurred on July 20, with the third executed on July 21. Yet, the three transfers combined only accounted for a modest 25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($745K). While we haven&#x2019;t reached the end of July, there have yet to be any reports of bitcoin activity from addresses dormant since 2010. Conversely, June witnessed the awakening of three sleeping bitcoin addresses (<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i">1</a>,<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1MSij5Qi9EbxGFLB9RmfHEFvfK51a9B3hx">2</a>,<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1PJs7kzDby9887tGMjFQ7fPhUzSFtm7mTS">3</a>) from 2010, totaling 150 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($4.4M).</p>

<p>An economist with the Heritage Foundation has warned about the potential calamity of the U.S. dollar losing its reserve currency status.

The burden of government debt for every American is 10 times heavier than that for a Chinese citizen, according to the study.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Ranks Second in the World by Debt per Citizen, China in Top 50</h2>
<p>People in Singapore owed more than any other nation in 2022 as far as sovereign debt per capita is concerned, according to an analysis of data compiled by the United Nations. The share of each citizen of the city-state amounted to $117,400, according to the research conducted by the Russian RIA Novosti news agency.</p>
<p>The U.S. is second with $93,000 for each American. In June, the country’s debt surpassed the $32-trillion mark for the first time. That happened after President Joe Biden’s administration and House Republicans <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-republicans-strike-tentative-deal-to-raise-us-debt-ceiling/">struck a deal</a> to raise the debt ceiling at the end of May.</p>
<p>The United States is followed by Japan with $88,400. Canada comes in fourth place with $58,900 and Belgium ranks fifth with $52,600. Iceland ($51,200), Italy ($49,200), France ($47,100), Ireland ($47,100), and the U.K. ($46,600) are also in the top 10.</p>
<p>A number of other developed nations are in the top 30, including Norway (with $42,100), Australia ($36,500), and Switzerland ($36,200) as well as the European Union’s economic power house, Germany, with $32,600.</p>

<p>The U.N. numbers ranked Russia 94th last year, with $2,980 of state debt per capita. At the same time, according to the Russian Ministry of Finance (Minfin) and the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), Russia’s debt per capita was around $2,200, the report notes.</p>
<p>Among the members of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">BRICS</a> bloc of developing economies (Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa), the People’s Republic of China had the highest public debt per capita — $9,900, ranking 47th in the world. Brazil takes 57th place with $7,700. South Africa, where the public debt per capita was $4,700, was 75th, and India was 112th in 2022, with $2,000.</p>
<p>Members of the Eurasian Economic Union (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EAEU</a>) fared relatively well by the studied indicator. Armenia, where each citizen accounted for $3,200 of public debt last year, was 90th, Belarus took 91st place with $3,100, Kazakhstan ranked 99th with $2,700, and Kyrgyzstan was 139th with a per capita sovereign debt of $871.</p>

While copy trading is gaining popularity globally, traders and prospective users from Africa appear more interested in the strategy than those from other regions.</strong></p>
<h2>Africa-Based Users More Interested in Copy Trading</h2>
<p>According to Gracy Chen, the managing director of the crypto derivatives and copy trading platform Bitget, copying trading is a trading strategy which has not only &#8220;disrupted the crypto industry&#8221; but has become increasingly more popular with novice traders. She added that for some cases, copy trading has proven to be an effective strategy during the so-called &#8220;crypto winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>To support such assertions about this portfolio management strategy, Chen made reference to a <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/africas-copy-trading-boom-true-adoption-or-a-passing-fase/">report</a> highlighting the &#8220;300% growth in copy trading adoption in the last 24 months.&#8221; As the report (which relied on Google search data) noted, while copy trading is popular globally, traders and prospective users from Africa appear to be more interested in the strategy.</p>
<p>Described as a method that enables traders to copy specific strategies, this trading tactic is said to link &#8220;a portion of the copying trader&#8217;s funds to the account of the copied investor.&#8221; This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_trading">trading strategy</a> is thought to be popular with more risk-averse investors and traders.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Copy Trading Favored by Risk-Averse Traders</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in remarks to Bitcoin.com News, Chen also highlighted the impact copy trading has had on Bitget. For instance, Chen pointed to the over 400,000 traders on Bitget who have used this trading strategy since its launch in May 2020. The Bitget managing director also explained how the continuing bear market is likely to convince the more risk-averse traders to pivot to copy trading.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the bear market continuing, people will want to leverage professional traders’ knowledge,&#8221; Chen said.</p>
<p>Chen revealed that Bitget’s internal user data already indicates that as many as 28% of traders have resorted to copy trading at least once in 2023. She also added that as many as 109,000 followers of the platform&#8217;s professional traders have made a profit.</p>
<p>While copy trading is the main reason why Bitget’s share of the market has grown over the past few years, Chen told Bitcoin.com News that the platform’s partnership with the football star Lionel Messi has also proven to be a shrewd business decision. In addition, the setting of a protection fund as well as the regular publishing of Bitget’s proof-of-reserves have also helped reassure users.</p>
<p>On why Bitget chose to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitget-targets-middle-east-as-next-region-for-business-expansion-301881737.html">set up</a> an office in the Middle East, the managing director pointed to the region’s perceived crypto-friendly policies. She also added that the presence of influencers and Bitget’s partners in the region also justify the decision to set up offices there.</p>

The application, which will be available for download next week, comes after recent updates of Google’s Bard and a report revealing that Apple is working on its own chatbot service.</strong></p>
<h2>Android Users to Have Chatgpt in Their Pockets, Openai Says</h2>
<p>Microsoft-funded AI developer Openai is releasing an Android app for its chatbot powered by artificial intelligence technology, Chatgpt. It will be rolling out to users next week, the company said, but can be pre-ordered in the Google Play Store since Friday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Announcing ChatGPT for Android! The app will be rolling out to users next week, and you can pre-order in the Google Play Store starting today: <a href="https://t.co/NfBDYZR5GI">https://t.co/NfBDYZR5GI</a></p>
<p>— OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1682480558545461249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>With the application, people with Android phones will have Chatgpt in their pockets, the company added, promising them its latest advancements. The app will be free and allow users to synchronize chatbot history across multiple devices, according to the app&#8217;s Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page</a>.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking Chatgpt, built upon Openai’s large language models (LLMs), was launched at the end of November 2022. It has since fascinated millions of users of its web browser version with the ability to understand natural language and generate responses in multiple languages. Although, a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> claims that the chatbot’s latest models are giving less accurate answers.</p>
<p>Chatgpt’s Android app will not share user information with third party organizations and businesses, Openai explained. The data is encrypted and transferred over a secure connection and users will be able to request to be deleted. The Android premiere comes two months after the company presented a Chatgpt application for iOS devices.</p>

<p>Chatgpt’s immense popularity spurred a race in the tech sector to offer competitive alternatives. In February, Microsoft’s search engine Bing integrated a chatbot feature based on Openai’s GPT-4 LLM. Google released its AI chatbot called Bard in a limited capacity in March and it was updated with new features in July. Investor Elon Musk, who was initially involved in Openai, also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-to-launch-truthgpt-says-microsoft-backed-chatbot-is-trained-to-lie/">announced</a> plans to launch a platform he called “Truthgpt.”</p>
<p>According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Apple has been quietly developing AI-based tools to rival the products of Openai, Google and others. Sources familiar with the ongoing work claim that the company which makes iPhone has built a framework named “Ajax” to create LLMs and a chatbot service referred to by some as “Apple GPT.”</p>

In addition, the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC) official stated that digital yuan in circulation amounted to 16.5 billion yuan.</strong></p>
<h2>Latest Digital Yuan Stats</h2>
<p>People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Yi Gang disclosed the latest statistics on China&#8217;s central bank digital currency (CBDC) on Wednesday at a lecture organized by Singapore&#8217;s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p>The Chinese central banker revealed that transactions utilizing China&#8217;s central bank digital currency, also called e-CNY, reached 1.8 trillion yuan ($250 billion) at the end of June. By comparison, approximately 100 billion in digital yuan transactions were recorded in August last year.</p>
<p>Yi also revealed that China&#8217;s central bank digital currency in circulation amounted to 16.5 billion yuan at the end of June. Moreover, he stated that the total number of digital yuan transactions hit 950 million, with 120 million wallets being opened.</p>

<p>Noting that e-CNY in circulation accounted for only 0.16% of China&#8217;s M0 money supply, or cash in circulation, Yi was quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now the balance of e-CNY is only counting two-tenths of 1% of M0, so that the balance is very small, but with this kind of balance (we) support a big number of transactions, which means that the velocity is high and more efficient.</p></blockquote>
<p>The PBOC launched pilot trials for the digital yuan at the end of 2019 and has been testing the digital currency in various cities across China, including Suzhou, Shenzhen, Xiongan, and Chengdu. In July, the city of Jinan implemented digital yuan payments for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-city-of-jinan-implements-digital-yuan-payments-for-public-transportation-fares/">public transportation fares</a>. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/shanghai-clearing-house-introduces-support-for-digital-yuan-settlements/">Shanghai Clearing House</a> also recently added support for digital yuan settlements. Meanwhile, Bank of China expanded digital yuan <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-china-expands-digital-yuan-testing-to-sim-cards-and-nfc-payments/">testing to SIM cards and NFC payments</a>.</p>

He clarified that the BRICS members will focus on de-dollarization and promoting the use of national currencies in international trade instead of the U.S. dollar.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS to Focus on Reducing Dollar Reliance</h2>
<p>The topic of a common BRICS currency is not on the agenda to be discussed at the economic group’s upcoming leaders’ summit, South Africa’s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, reportedly said Thursday.</p>
<p>South Africa, being the current chair of the BRICS group, will be hosting the summit in Johannesburg on Aug. 22-24. Sooklal explained that the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will discuss using national currencies and reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. He was quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s never been talk of a BRICS currency, it&#8217;s not on the agenda &#8230; What we have said and we continue to deepen is trading in local currencies and settlement in local currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Russian news outlet RT <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">claimed</a> that the BRICS nations will announce a gold-backed common currency at the August summit. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, stated that the economic bloc has no immediate plan to launch a currency to compete with the U.S. dollar. Noting the distinction between de-dollarization efforts and the creation of a common BRICS currency, he stressed: &#8220;The development of anything alternative is indeed a medium to long-term ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s President <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-voices-support-for-brics-currency/">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have championed the concept of a common currency as the BRICS nations endeavor to counter Western dominance in global finance. This followed heavy financial sanctions the West placed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies have frozen about $300 billion in Russian central bank assets, prompting many countries to seek alternatives to the USD.</p>
<p>Regarding de-dollarization, Sooklal explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>BRICS started a process that has been expedited as a result of the conflict, as a result of unilateral sanctions … The days of a dollar-centric world is over, that’s a reality. We have a multipolar global trading system today.</p></blockquote>

<p>Earlier this month, India&#8217;s foreign minister emphasized that currencies would remain “very much a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indias-external-affairs-minister-shuns-brics-currency-talks-prioritizes-rupees-strength-instead/">national issue</a> for a long time to come.” Russia&#8217;s central bank governor also expressed similar sentiments, noting that a BRICS currency would necessitate the consent of multiple parties due to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-central-bank-brics-currency-requires-consent-of-many-parties-faces-implementation-challenges/">implementation challenges</a>. Furthermore, South Africa&#8217;s central bank governor highlighted that a common currency would require the establishment of a banking union, a fiscal union, and macroeconomic convergence.</p>
<p>Sooklal also revealed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">more than 40 countries</a> are interested in joining the BRICS bloc, with 22 of them having already submitted formal applications. The diplomat believes that the BRICS group could expand to include more than 50 countries.</p>
