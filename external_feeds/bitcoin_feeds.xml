Last March, DeSantis pushed for legislation to prohibit a CBDC in Florida. At Tuesday’s event called &#8220;Government of Laws, Not Woke Politics,&#8221; he stated that if the U.S. Federal Reserve or Treasury were to codify a CBDC, his state would have a &#8220;prohibition against&#8221; it.</strong></p>
<h2>DeSantis Slams &#8216;Woke Politics,&#8217; Insisting ‘They Don’t Like Crypto Because They Can’t Control Crypto’</h2>
<p>On May 2, 2023, the Republican Florida governor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fl-gov-desantis-proposes-ban-on-central-bank-digital-currency-use-as-money/">Ron DeSantis</a> spoke about the state&#8217;s economic policy during a visit to Jacksonville on May 2, 2023. He <a href="https://news.wjct.org/2023-05-02/desantis-signs-esg-ban-jacksonville">signed a bill</a> aimed at combatting the U.S. government&#8217;s environmental social governance (ESG) standards, stating that he wanted to protect Floridians from ESG. The bill prohibits the use of Florida&#8217;s state funds for ESG standards and investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are recognizing the dangers with this agenda,” DeSantis stated. &#8220;It&#8217;s not your agenda; it&#8217;s not the agenda of the average Floridian or average American. This is an elite-imposed agenda,” the governor added. In addition to criticizing ESG standards, DeSantis also spoke out against the federal government&#8217;s central bank digital currency (CBDC) ideas. He expressed support for cryptocurrencies that are not associated with CBDCs.</p>
<p>“I think what the danger of the digital currency is that, one, they want to make that the sole currency, they want to get rid of crypto,” DeSantis <a href="https://flvoicenews.com/desantis-to-u-s-government-florida-will-resist-outlaw-cbdc-if-implemented/">stated</a>. “They don’t like crypto because they can’t control crypto. So they want to put everything in a central bank digital currency.”</p>
<p>DeSantis shares the view of several Republican officials who have criticized the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Minnesota congressman Tom Emmer <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-launches-cbdc-anti-surveillance-state-act-to-protect-americans-right-to-financial-privacy/">introduced</a> the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Anti-Surveillance State Act, while Texas senator Ted Cruz has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-direct-to-consumer-central-bank-digital-currency/">created legislation</a> against the government developing a CBDC. Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/georgia-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-criticizes-fednow-project-pushes-for-return-to-gold-standard/">spoken out</a> against CBDCs, and 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-government-could-ban-seize-bitcoin-cbdcs-could-lead-to-financial-slavery-political-tyranny/">warned</a> that a central bank digital currency could lead to financial slavery.</p>

<p>During his visit to Jacksonville, DeSantis emphasized his opposition to CBDCs, stating that they would not be accepted in the Sunshine State. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Congress would authorize it, but if the Fed or the Treasury tries to do it unilaterally – in Florida, we [will] have a prohibition against that,&#8221; the governor remarked. &#8220;That&#8217;s ensuring your financial independence and making sure that we don&#8217;t have a financial surveillance state where they know every transaction that you&#8217;re making.&#8221;</p>

<h2>U.S. Economy and Stagflation</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff warned about the U.S. economy facing a period of stagflation, characterized by high inflation and high unemployment, in an interview with Fox News Thursday. Schiff explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Q1 of this year, inflation actually strengthened over the fourth quarter of last year. So, not only is the economy weakening, but inflation is strengthening. You have the worst of both worlds. This is stagflation and it’s going to get worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on Nobel laureate Paul Krugman&#8217;s opinion piece, published by the New York Times last week, stating that the U.S. economy is in better shape than most people realize and that &#8220;America has experienced a remarkably fast and essentially complete job market recovery,&#8221; Schiff argued: &#8220;If you look at the jobs that have been created, they are low-paying service sector jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiff added: &#8220;So what&#8217;s happened during the Biden presidency is people have lost good jobs — high-paying jobs with benefits — and they&#8217;ve been forced to replace them with two or three low-paying part-time jobs. That’s where all the jobs are coming from. That’s what the numbers show. The only reason we’re creating jobs is because we’re destroying so many good jobs, and you need to cobble together two or three part-time jobs to try to replace your lost income.&#8221; The gold bug also disagreed with Krugman&#8217;s view that inflation has &#8220;subsided substantially&#8221; and the overall situation is &#8220;not so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Multiple people, besides Schiff, have warned about stagflation in the U.S. economy. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told Bloomberg Saturday that &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a bit of a stagflationary problem developing.&#8221; Quincy Krosby, the chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said last week: “Financial markets continue to doubt Jerome Powell’s resolve in restoring price stability despite his steadfast position that the Fed must not allow 1970s style stagflation take hold with pauses between rate hikes.&#8221;</p>

The new platform will enable institutional users outside of the United States to trade bitcoin and ethereum perpetual futures. The company stated in a tweet that the service will begin by offering perpetual futures settled in USDC with up to 5x leverage to institutional clients in eligible jurisdictions.</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase Reveals Bitcoin and Ethereum Perpetual Futures Settled in USDC With up to 5x Leverage</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1653385513011740672?s=20">launch</a> of Coinbase International Exchange follows the company&#8217;s approval to operate its digital currency operations in Bermuda, which was <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/an-update-to-coinbases-global-scale-to-go-broad-and-deep">granted</a> by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/introducing-coinbase-international-exchange">blog post</a>, Coinbase noted that “building out a global perpetual futures exchange for digital assets will help support an updating of the financial system by making Coinbase’s trusted products and services more accessible to users of digital assets who live outside of the [United States].”</p>
<p>Coinbase added:</p>
<blockquote><p>As more and more markets are moving forward with regulatory frameworks to become crypto hubs, we believe the moment is right to launch this international exchange.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company insists that the Coinbase International Exchange provides a “liquidation framework that meets rigorous compliance standards” and will include real-time 24/7 trading and liquidity provided by external market makers.</p>

<p>The announcement comes after Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-informs-crypto-exchange-coinbase-of-potential-securities-law-violations/">received</a> a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for potential violations. Following the notice, Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-files-legal-action-against-sec-over-lack-of-regulatory-clarity/">filed an action suit</a> against the SEC for lack of regulatory clarity and also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-shares-wells-response-challenges-secs-change-in-attitude-towards-its-core-businesses/">shared</a> its Wells response with the public shortly after.</p>
<p>Coinbase notes that while other jurisdictions are moving forward with crypto-forward regulatory frameworks, it would like to see the United States take a similar approach instead of regulation by enforcement, which has led to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the country.</p>

Amidst this technological revolution, Crypto.com&#8217;s CEO Kris Marszalek recently hosted an ask-me-anything (AMA) discussion, where he unveiled the exchange&#8217;s latest offering — an AI-powered user companion named Amy.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Education Goes High-Tech With Amy, Crypto.com&#8217;s Latest AI Offering</h2>
<p>Crypto.com’s new chatbot, Amy, has been designed to assist users in their quest to learn more about the crypto industry, providing them with information on various crypto assets and projects. With its AI capabilities, Amy can offer users &#8220;near real-time information&#8221; on the latest developments in the crypto world, as well as insights into historical events that have shaped the industry. From blockchain technology to price listings, the firm says Amy is well-versed in all aspects of the crypto landscape, making it a resource for anyone seeking to expand their knowledge in this field.</p>
<p>The company stated that Amy is based on ChatGPT from OpenAI, but Amy is specifically designed for cryptocurrency and blockchain information. Currently, Crypto.com has launched Amy as a pilot in its beta phase, and select users who leverage a <a href="https://crypto.com/price">crypto.com/price</a> account will be permitted to access the AI-powered chatbot. “Access to Amy will be steadily scaled to more Crypto.com users over the coming weeks,” the company <a href="https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-continues-ambitious-product-and-service-rollout-with-new-pioneering-innovation">disclosed</a>. “Crypto.com will also introduce Amy to additional Crypto.com experiences over time, including within the Crypto.com App.”</p>

<p>Crypto.com is not the only digital currency business to develop an AI product. On March 1, 2023, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-tests-ai-infused-nft-platform-bicasso-in-limited-10k-mint-run/">unveiled</a> an AI-infused non-fungible token (NFT) art platform named <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/nft/bicasso">Bicasso</a>. The platform conducted a limited run of 10,000 mints and then closed the software to general users, and there is now a waitlist to join. In its Tuesday announcement, Crypto.com specified that Amy &#8220;does not provide financial or investment advice.&#8221; The company also stated that “learnings from this pilot will be applied to Amy’s continued rollout, as well as future AI-powered projects from Crypto.com.”</p>
<p>“Building the ecosystem has been a priority focus for Crypto.com from the start,” Marszalek remarked. “We double downed on our commitments to building and responsible innovation, and Amy is the latest example of our incredible momentum.”</p>

On Tuesday afternoon, all four major U.S. benchmark stock indexes are in decline as regional bank stocks hit new lows.</strong></p>
<h2>Banking Industry on Edge as Pacwest Shares Sink Causing Trading Halt</h2>
<p>Pacwest, a regional bank based in Beverly Hills, California, is facing challenges after the release of its <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/04/25/2654467/13824/en/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-2023.html">2023 first quarter earnings report</a>. Following the publication of the earnings, the bank&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-PACW/">stock price</a> plummeted by 35% on Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The earnings report revealed a &#x201C;net loss available to common stockholders of $1.21 billion, or a loss of $10.22 per diluted share.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The upheaval at Pacwest comes on the heels of First Republic Bank&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">recent collapse</a> and three major bank failures that occurred in March. Despite three out of these four banks representing the largest bank failures in the United States, President Joe Biden <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stabilizing-the-banking-system-biden-reassures-public-amid-first-republic-bank-collapse-but-warns-of-national-debt-default/">reassured</a> the public on Monday that the banking industry is on track toward &#x201C;stabilization.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Besides Pacwest shares dropping over 35%, trading was halted due to volatility concerns. Other banks experiencing losses on Tuesday include Western Alliance and Metropolitan Bank, whose stocks have also seen sharp declines during today&#x2019;s trading sessions. Amidst this turmoil within bank equities, CFRA analyst Alexander Yokum <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pacwest-bancorp-western-alliance-post-steep-losses-after-first-republic-deal-25b8a87f">told</a> Marketwatch that while taxpayers will not be responsible for these failures, financial institutions are likely to increase fees.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All the costs of bank failures will be borne by banks and not taxpayers, although we expect banks to indirectly pass along many of these costs to customers through higher fees and higher interest rates on loans,&#x201D; Yokum stated.</p>
<p>The collapse of First Republic Bank has left Wall Street investors uneasy, even though JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/01/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-first-republic.html">declared</a> on Monday that &#x201C;this part of the crisis is over&#x201D; after taking over the struggling bank. While conventional equity markets are down, cryptocurrencies and precious metals have experienced growth amidst the banking industry&#x2019;s tribulations.</p>

<p>Notably, the top two leading cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">increased</a> by 1.1% to 1.5% in the wake of Wall Street&#x2019;s turmoil. Concurrently, the precious metals <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">gold and silver</a> have also surged in value against the U.S. dollar, with gains ranging between 1.4% and 1.54%.</p>
<p>After sinking more than 35% on Tuesday, Pacwest shares rebounded and are currently down between 22% to 27% against the greenback.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin&#8217;s Hashrate Surges to Unprecedented Heights, Nearly Reaching Half a Zettahash</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On the second day of May 2023, Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate achieved a remarkable feat, tapping into a new record at <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/787895">block height 787,895</a>. In a stunning display of computational power, the network reached a 24-hour high of approximately <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">491.15 EH/s</a>. This momentous spike in hashrate comes at a time when the network has been recording an average of roughly <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">344.4 EH/s</a> over the past 2,016 blocks, with the hashrate dipping below the 300 EH/s range on five separate occasions since April 2, 2023.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the month of April has seen <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3y">slower block intervals</a>, with block times consistently exceeding the ten-minute average over the 30-day period. The consequences of Bitcoin&#8217;s slower block times have been significant, leading to a notable backup in the mempool. As of 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on May 2, data shows that a staggering <a href="https://mempool.space">240,000+ transactions remain unconfirmed</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The latest surge in hashrate follows a previous milestone achieved on April 18, 2023, when the network <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-miners-contend-with-fifth-network-difficulty-increase-of-2023/">tapped 440.80 EH/s</a> at block height 786,013. However, Bitcoin&#8217;s current all-time high of 491.15 EH/s is even more impressive, and awfully close to a half zettahash. To put this into perspective, a zettahash represents an astronomical number of hashes, equivalent to one sextillion hashes per second.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-reaches-400-exahash-per-second-researcher-says-network-could-reach-zettahash-era-by-2025/">report</a> by Bitcoin.com News, research analyst Sam Wouters from River Financial made a bold prediction that Bitcoin could enter the zettahash era in two years&#8217; time. Wouters&#8217; estimates suggest that &#8220;at the current growth rate in 2023, we&#8217;d reach a Zettahash by the end of 2025.” Despite the network&#8217;s quick all-time high in hashrate, block times continue to lag behind the ten-minute average, and a downward difficulty adjustment between <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">1.22%</a> to <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">2%</a> is expected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, Foundry USA reigns as the top mining pool, <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">boasting 107.66 EH/s</a> or 31.17% of Bitcoin&#8217;s total hashpower. Foundry is followed closely by Antpool with 80.75 EH/s, F2pool&#8217;s 42.62 EH/s, Binance Pool&#8217;s 29.91 EH/s, and Viabtc&#8217;s 23.18 EH/s.</p>

Prices fell for a long-term support point of $5.60, as the global crypto market cap was once again 1% lower today. Avalanche also hit a price floor on Tuesday.</strong></p>
<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) was down for a second straight session on Tuesday, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remained bearish.</p>
<p>DOT/USD dropped to a low of $5.61 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $5.82.</p>
<p>As a result of the move, polkadot slipped to its weakest point since March 12, when price was trading at $5.47.</p>

<p>Today’s decline saw DOT near a floor at $5.60, with bulls so far rejecting a breakout below this point.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the token is trading at $5.68, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped from a floor of its own.</p>
<p>The index rebounded from a floor at 36.00, and as of writing, is tracking at 37.52.</p>

<h2>Avalanche (AVAX)</h2>
<p>In addition to DOT, Avalanche (AVAX) was another notable mover on Tuesday, as the token fell to its own level of support.</p>
<p>Following a high of $17.06 to start the week, AVAX/USD sunk to a bottom at $16.53 earlier today.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s decline saw bears attempt to take avalanche to a long-term price floor at $16.30, however they were unsuccessful, thus far.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, and similar to what occurred with DOT, the breakout was rejected as the RSI remained above a floor of 41.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, price strength is tracking at 41.27, with a ceiling of 43.00 a possible target for bulls looking to extend the current rebound.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a chance that AVAX could reach $17.00</p>

He expressed his belief that a sell-off could be imminent, and that this could occur as a result of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s upcoming remarks on Wednesday. Furthermore, there has been a great deal of conjecture surrounding the possibility of the central bank cutting the federal funds rate multiple times throughout the year. However, Wilson believes that investors who are expecting this outcome will ultimately be disappointed.</strong></p>
<h2>Powell’s Message Could Spark a ‘Near-Term Negative Surprise for Equities’</h2>
<p>This Wednesday, all eyes will be on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, as the U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps). While some economists <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-central-bank-expected-to-raise-lending-rate-by-25bps-experts-predict-final-hike-of-2023/">predict</a> that this hike will be the final one of the year, a few market observers anticipate multiple rate cuts in the future. These speculators point to the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">banking industry turmoil</a> in the U.S. as a potential catalyst for the Fed to loosen its monetary policy.</p>
<p>However, there are several analysts who believe that investors expecting cuts are in for a rude awakening. They caution that the Fed&#8217;s commitment to holding rates high and not cutting this year is unwavering, due to persistent inflation. According to Morgan Stanley&#8217;s equity strategist, Michael Wilson, U.S. equity markets may be in for a rough ride this week if chairman Jerome Powell fails to meet the market&#8217;s expectations of a benchmark rate cut.</p>
<p>Wilson <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-feds-powell-could-spoil-u-s-stocks-2023-rally-according-to-morgan-stanleys-mike-wilson-2a75868c">warns</a> that a &#8220;hawkish&#8221; message from Powell could trigger a &#8220;near-term negative surprise for equities,&#8221; causing a sell-off. Wilson also notes that the market has grown increasingly reliant on tech stocks with large valuations, which could exacerbate the impact of any negative news. Furthermore, he warns that investors who are banking on the Fed cutting rates this year are likely to be frustrated with the outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that equities are priced for an optimistic policy outcome (rate cuts in &#8217;23 without the growth downside),&#8221; Wilson stated in his note to investors.</p>

<h2>Fed Officials Desire to Avoid the Mistakes of Past Fed Chairs</h2>
<p>The sentiment that the Federal Reserve will maintain its strict stance on interest rates is not limited to Morgan Stanley&#8217;s equity strategist. Claudia Sahm, an American economist and macroeconomic expert, echoed this sentiment on Sunday, stating that Powell had made it clear that the Fed would not cut rates this year and that people should &#8220;believe him.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Claudia_Sahm/status/1652776776370733057?s=20">Twitter thread</a>, Sahm thinks the Fed&#8217;s stance will be strict for three reasons: the desire to avoid the mistakes of past Fed chairs, the reverence for former chair Paul Volcker&#8217;s approach to monetary policy, and the personal experiences of current Fed officials with high inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s. Sahm <a href="https://twitter.com/Claudia_Sahm/status/1652777178482761729?s=20">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Markets expect the Fed to cut multiple times this year—referred to as a pivot—while the Fed says it will hold rates high and not cut this year. I believe the Fed.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to Claudia Sahm&#8217;s comments on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s commitment to holding rates high, the Twitter account Wall Street Silver <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1652831462075379713?s=20">pointed out</a> that while Paul Volcker&#8217;s monetary policy and the emergence of new oil sources in the early 1980s helped control inflation, the underlying problems persist.</p>
<p>“The Fed can’t solve this problem,” Wall Street Silver said. They can kill the economy, but as soon as rates come down, the same underlying problems exist and inflation roars back. The Fed only has one tool and will print us into oblivion eventually, because they can’t fix this.” Sahm <a href="https://twitter.com/Claudia_Sahm/status/1652839801609920514?s=20">clarified</a> that she was merely explaining “how the history is viewed inside the Fed, not what’s true.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think the Federal Reserve&#8217;s commitment to holding rates high will be enough to control inflation, or will the underlying problems persist and lead to a potential economic crisis? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The Fed is expected to increase rates by 0.25%, despite the U.S. economy slowing down. Ethereum also remained lower, moving close to a breakout below $1,800. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped below $28,000 on Tuesday, as markets prepared for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $27,680.79 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which came less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $28,626.28.</p>
<p>As a result of this move, bitcoin nearly collided with its recent price floor at $27,600, hitting a six-day low in the process.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_585969">
<dt>
<p></p></dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Looking at the chart, the latest decline comes as the relative strength index (RSI) moved below a floor of its own at 50.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 46.17, with the next visible point of support at 43.00.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has since moved back above $28,000, and is currently trading at $28,176.91.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also lower in today&#x2019;s session, with prices also falling to a key level of support.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,851.19 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD plunged to a bottom at $1,809.19 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s drop saw the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency move below its long-term price floor at $1,830.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_585970">
<dt>

<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> has since rebounded from this floor, as sentiment remained relatively stable, despite the earlier decline.</p></dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p>This happened despite the RSI trading under a support point of its own at 45.00, with a current reading of 44.30.</p>
<p>There could be more moves on Wednesday following the Fed decision, with a potential move above $1,900 still on the cards.</p>

The deal would include the integration of India&#8217;s Rupay card system and its Russian counterpart, Mir Cards, to allow seamless payments between the two countries.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia and India Consider Integration of Payment Stacks</h2>
<p>Russia and India are mulling the integration of their debit payment stacks in order to prevent negative affects on their common payment flows by a hypothetical extension of U.S. sanctions in the future. In a recent high-level meeting, in which India&#8217;s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov were present, the countries <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/india-russia-to-explore-possibility-of-accepting-rupay-and-mir-cards/articleshow/99885963.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to explore this integration to facilitate capital flows.</p>
<p>The agreement included considering the acceptance of Russia&#8217;s Mir Cards system in India, and India&#8217;s Rupay system in Russia, allowing citizens of both countries to make cross-border payments using debit cards natively.</p>
<p>There were also talks about a higher integration at the event, with authorities agreeing to further explore the interaction of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the Indian payment stack, and the Faster Payments System (FPS), its Russian counterpart.</p>
<p>India has been active in integrating its payment system with other countries. In February, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/20/india-singapore-upi-paynow/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADBtkQGkuJjK_DAqW1iQRy6wBJJ56kHijLDVT7ZRxYHzlUjmEEQ_nwj6qdECkYYZz90ZZV8l4plNBdIRljbdacEdb5vJPfLwkd39mYDsrV8iawqDeMNPalCuzHcbxD4pN6gfgQBxjOFqG6RhouGHyQ1gl08cir8DA0CqJ-KsFHJ6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked</a> Singapore&#8217;s payments system, called Paynow, into its payment stack, allowing cross-border payments between the two countries without using additional payment bridges.</p>

<h2>Preventing US Sanction Effects</h2>
<p>The main objective behind this exploration is to prepare for a possible <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-president-joe-biden-extends-sanctions-against-russia-has-argued-alternatives-would-involve-waging-third-world-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extension</a> of U.S. sanctions that would cut the connection between the banking systems of the two countries, making the possibility of direct payments unfeasible. While this is being projected into the future, some Indian companies have already been unable to collect payments linked to dividends of Russian oil companies due to the sanctions enacted by the U.S. government on Moscow.</p>
<p>According to local <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/indian-firms-dividends-from-russian-oil-projects-stuck/articleshow/99867884.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Oil India, Bharat Petroleum Corp, and Indian Oil Corp — four Indian companies — have had payments of between $300 and $400 million blocked since last year due to the disconnection of Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system, that allows for cross-border payment using the current banking system.</p>
