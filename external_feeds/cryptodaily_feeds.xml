			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bull markets are the most exciting times in the market, and precedent shows that a single cryptocurrency is capable of starting a bull market. The last 2021 bull market was a run that started with Dogecoin(DOGE), and the market never looked back until it touched the $3 trillion market cap. Some mini-runs we&rsquo;ve seen during this bear market have also been inspired by top-gaining cryptocurrencies for the short term.</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) is an honorable mention regarding market excitement, especially following the token airdrop, which caused a small price run-up for other cryptocurrencies. However, there&rsquo;s an even better play in the market at the moment, and you better get in early on Uwerx.</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) Causing Market Excitement</p>
<p>Arbitrum(ARB) is one of the earliest Ethereum layer-2 solutions in the crypto market, launched in August 2021. So when the network announced last year that it would run an airdrop, there was increased activity on the network with users trying to secure airdrop allocations.</p>
<p>The airdrop eventually came in March 2023 and was allocated to early users on the network. The minimum 625 ARB allocation was worth well over $800 at launch, and the maximum allocation of 10,200 ARB was enough to cause market excitement. The market saw high trading volume in the days that followed, and today, Arbitrum turnovers higher daily volume than networks like Avalanche(AVAX), Shiba Inu(SHIB), Tron(TRX), Polkadot(DOT), and even Polygon(MATIC).</p>
<p>However, this traction does not compare to the new excitement Uwerx is creating.</p>
<p>Can Uwerx(WERX) Kickstart A Bull Run?</p>
<p>Uwerx is bringing some new excitement to the market with its presale token backed with great utility. One of the major signs of a bull market is we begin to see money from other industries come into crypto. In this case, Uwerx is merging the global gig economy with the crypto market. But what exactly does Uwerx do?</p>
<p>Uwerx is an emerging blockchain-based freelance platform that aims to use the resources available on blockchain to create a better platform for independent workers. Uwerx&rsquo;s new platform will feature many unique features, but more importantly, it prioritizes giving back more value to its users.</p>
<p>Contrary to predominant freelance platforms, Uwerx will likewise operate a decentralized platform to connect independent workers to jobs, clients, and businesses. Uwerx will include features including transparent pricing, incentivization, personalized matching, and several built-in tools to foster effective work contracts for freelancers. The native token WERX will serve as a massive store of value for the platform and will be the primary currency of the platform. However, Uwerx will also allow users to process payments with other cryptocurrencies, solving one of the biggest payment limitations in the industry.</p>
<p>Uwerx is primed for a run after presale, and early buyers on presale get in at a very low price. At a $0.0225 presale price, early buyers have a potential 10,000% profit to look forward to. In the worst-case scenario, the final presale price is around $0.095 - $0.115, which is some decent 10x profit for early buyers even before launch; don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Revolut, Britain's most valuable fintech company, could face disappointment as the Bank of England plans to reject its application for a banking licence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority, responsible for licensing, has informed the government of its intention to issue a statutory warning notice to Revolut, citing concerns over the company's balance sheet. Revolut contends that auditors' concerns were related to revenues, not the balance sheet.</p>
<p>According to a report in the UK Telegraph, the warning notice has not been served yet and urgent talks are underway behind the scenes in an effort to salvage the licence application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revolut, an app offering many financial services, has expanded globally, making it one of the world's most valuable fintech firms and Britain's most valuable tech start-up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite already holding a Lithuanian banking licence, securing approval from the Bank of England has been seen as a crucial stepping stone for Revolut to expand into other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Revolut had expressed confidence in obtaining a UK licence, but recent challenges have cast doubt on its prospects. The company's auditors, BDO, raised concerns about the &ldquo;completeness and occurrence&rdquo; of revenues amounting to &pound;477 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CEO Nik Storonsky voiced frustration with British regulators, citing long wait times for communication and an overly bureaucratic regulatory environment, suggesting that the company may be more inclined to go public in the US rather than the UK.</p>
Opinion
<p>The on-going saga of Revolut and of several other crypto-related companies wishing to receive licences in the UK appears to have no end. The UK is an incredibly conservative nation with traditional banking etched into its genes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very well for the government, or at least parts of it, to say that the UK wants to become a global hub for crypto. Many pro-crypto utterances and promises appear to be made in the political and international spheres, but the UK will have to contend with its deeply embedded banking industry, which has much power and influence over regulators and in the country&rsquo;s parliament.</p>
<p>The US also has massive influence in the UK, and its very harsh treatment of crypto is likely to be accompanied by much lobbying of the British government for it to go back on many of the pro-crypto promises it has made so far.</p>
<p>However, with Brexit forcing the UK to look for new markets, it still has a great opportunity to land a big chunk of crypto business and become the premier safe harbour for digital assets in Europe. The internal battle over crypto legitimacy in the UK will be very interesting to witness.</p>]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hashkey Group, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency investment landscape, is embarking on an ambitious funding drive for a valuation of $1 billion.&nbsp;</p>
Hashkey attempts to secure large funding
<p>According to Bloomberg, sources familiar with the matter have disclosed that Hashkey is currently engaged in preliminary discussions to secure a substantial funding round ranging from $100 million to $200 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the deal is steadily progressing, the specific details, including size and valuation, are yet to be finalised and remain subject to potential adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a diversified portfolio spanning venture funding, asset management, and trading, Hashkey is among the many local firms striving to expand their customer base within Hong Kong's rapidly liberalising environment.&nbsp;</p>
Hong Kong - a new financial hub
<p>The government of Hong Kong has been diligently fostering the development of the digital asset sector as part of a broader endeavour to restore the city's reputation as a pioneering financial hub. As part of these efforts, the city is poised to enable retail trading of major cryptocurrencies on licensed exchanges like Hashkey, ultimately rejuvenating the local economy and reversing the previous talent exodus triggered by Covid-related restrictions.</p>
<p>At present, Hashkey and BC Technology Group Co.'s OSL bourse are the sole licensed operators in the field. However, prominent exchanges such as OKX and Bitget have expressed their intent to seek licensure under Hong Kong's new regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s new found commitment to crypto businesses running out of the islands perhaps stems from the Chinese government&rsquo;s rethinking of its strategy towards crypto. It might appear that China will use Hong Kong as a ring fenced testing ground for cryptocurrency technology, while keeping crypto out of the Chinese mainland, at least for now.</p>
<p>From next month, Hong Kong will initiate its new licensing regime which will allow retail investors to trade certain major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an apparent hardening of its stance against crypto, Pakistan&rsquo;s government has stated that it would ban cryptocurrency services operational in the country and would never legalize crypto trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banning crypto was one of the requirements put forward by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).&nbsp;</p>
A Fresh Ban&nbsp;
<p>The announcement was made by Aisha Ghaus Pasha, the Minister of State for Finance and Revenue, during a session of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue on the 16th of May. The minister added that banning cryptocurrencies and crypto services operating in the country was one of the conditions set by the Financial Action Task Force. The task force had only recently removed Pakistan from its gray list. FATF&rsquo;s gray list consists of countries that the body considers lacking when it comes to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. However, these countries are viewed as working to ensure compliance and remedy their issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several other officials, such as State Bank of Pakistan Director Sohain Jawad, extended their support to the decision. According to reports, the State Bank of Pakistan and the Technology Ministry were working together to draft the ban legislation. While the Financial Action Task Force cannot impose any sanctions, its findings could influence government and corporate policies globally. In 2022, the State Bank of Pakistan announced that it planned to ban crypto. This was the first clear position the bank had taken on the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other banks have started reaching out to customers, informing them that cryptocurrency trading is illegal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As per regulatory instructions from the State Bank of Pakistan(SBP), any remittance of foreign exchange directly/indirectly outside Pakistan to overseas foreign exchange trading, margin trading, and CFD trading apps/websites/platforms through any payment channel is not allowed/permitted by SBP, and such payments are inherently risky and illegal.&rdquo;</p>

Crypto Community Voices Disapproval&nbsp;
<p>The Pakistani economy is facing an unprecedented crisis, with the government engaged in tense negotiations to secure a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As a result, FATF compliance when it comes to crypto becomes something of a necessity. However, the crypto community in the country criticized the move to announce a crypto ban. One handle stated that the government officials were destroying the country in the name of the FATF and the International Monetary Fund. Another user summed up his disapproval, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray that government focuses on the right area, which leads to scams and the apps which trap people, instead of banning crypto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another user going by the name of Crypto Arena added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People are making handsome income with crypto trading, and Govt wants to take this last hope from the Poor People of Pakistan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ban comes at a time of political turmoil as well, with former Prime Minister Imran Khan locked in a tense standoff with police in Lahore.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Adoption As Hedge Remains High&nbsp;
<p>Pakistani newspaper Dawn had reported that despite banks formally warning customers against using their debit and credit cards for crypto trading, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular in the country. According to Zeeshan Ahmed, the country general manager at Rain Financial, the annual volume of cryptocurrency trading has only gone up, rising to $25 billion from $18 billion just a year ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political turmoil and economic uncertainty has seen many Pakistanis convert their salaries into stablecoins to utilize as a hedge. Pakistan&rsquo;s Rupee has slid to an all-time low of 300 against the USD. Chairman of KTrade Securities and CEO of BlockTech Pakistan, Ali Farid Khwaja, stated that the population is worried about a sovereign default since the government has failed to secure support from the International Monetary Fund.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect that many people are buying USDT on crypto platforms as a way to get exposure to the US dollar. Even Bitcoin has performed well against the Pakistani Rupee. During the crypto run, reportedly more than 20 million Pakistanis had opened accounts on crypto platforms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s currency has fallen over 55% against the dollar over the past year, and stablecoins have emerged as a convenient way to access the US dollar for a majority of the population.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sister entity Alameda Research have sued their former executives Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh.</p>
<p>The new management at FTX alleges that its former executives mismanaged funds and failed to conduct proper due diligence before acquiring Embed.</p>
FTX Moves To Claw Back Funds
<p>The move is part of a series of lawsuits filed by FTX&rsquo;s new leadership as they look to recover around $240 million connected to FTX&rsquo;s acquisition of stock trading platform Embed Financial Technologies. Embed closed weeks before FTX filed for bankruptcy. The move is viewed as the first formal action by current FTX CEO John Ray against the company&rsquo;s former management and executives. The plaintiffs in the suits filed include FTX, its sister hedge fund Alameda Research, and West Realm Shires (WRS) Inc. The latter is the corporate entity under which FTX US operated as a cryptocurrency trading company.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, aiming to retrieve the funds spent during the acquisition.</p>
Details Of The Lawsuit
<p>According to documents filed with the court, FTX, Alameda Research, and West Realm Shires have accused former management of taking advantage of lax controls and a lack of recordkeeping and inflating the value of Embed. The papers further state that the management went on to purchase the platform for far more than it was worth. Furthermore, the lawsuit states that the defendants, addressed as &ldquo;FTX Insiders&rdquo; in the lawsuit, failed to conduct any sort of due diligence on Embed, instead prioritizing speed over all else in the transaction.</p>
<p>As a result, they ended up accepting all the terms set by Embed Founder and CEO Michael Giles during the negotiations. The lawsuit further added that Giles walked away from the negotiations after securing a deal worth around $157 million and an &ldquo;extravagant and unwarranted retention bonus&rdquo; as an incentive to wrap up the deal as quickly as possible. Negotiations with Giles began at the end of March 2022, with both parties signing a &ldquo;Memorandum of Terms&rdquo; by mid-April 2022. This gave the platform an enterprise value of $220 million, with a $75 million retention bonus to employees. This figure included the $55 million paid to Giles.</p>
<p>The deal was finalized a few weeks before FTX went bankrupt, with the group of FTX Insiders spending $248 million to acquire the company. The lawsuits allege that while the deal was concluded in six months, all essential terms were agreed upon in just a couple of weeks. The suit also pointed to the fact that the then-president of FTX had encountered several bugs in the Embed platform before concluding the deal, with even Giles admitting that the platform was facing multiple issues every day. The lawsuit further added that even Embed insiders were surprised that FTX was paying such a large amount for the company after just one meeting with Giles.</p>
FTX Hopes To Recover $250 Million
<p>The plaintiffs also accused Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh of causing the entity to issue Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs). These could be converted into common stocks in the event of the entity filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. FTX is hoping to revoke the SAFEs and recover all the funds that the company spent during the Embed acquisition. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have also asked the court to issue directives to the defendants to bear all legal costs related to the lawsuit.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Horizon Blockchain Games and Polygon Labs have announced a strategic partnership designed to revolutionize web3 infrastructure with an integration of Sequence, Horizon's comprehensive web3 developer platform, into Polygon Supernets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The collaboration is aimed at promoting scalability, security, and improved user experience within the platform. The introduction of Horizon's Sequence product into Polygon Supernets is poised to respond to and take care of the specific requirements and needs on an enterprise level, alongside providing tooling for decentralized application developers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sequence operates a web3 wallet and infrastructure stack, encouraging accelerated development on Polygon Supernets. The alliance offers credits to incentivize projects, which includes a toolkit composed of the Sequence Wallet, Token &amp; NFT APIs, Indexer, Relayer, Node Gateway, Marketplaces, and SDKs for projects aligning with Polygon Supernets, Polygon zkEVM, and Polygon PoS.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The partnership builds upon previous successes of Horizon and Polygon Labs collaborations. Past notable collaborations include SuperGaming&rsquo;s Tower Conquest, Cool Cats, BoomLand, Magic Eden, Sunflower Land, among others. Through this strategic alliance, developers and brands are being presented with a wide array of web3 tools with Sequence's all-in-one stack, aiming to augment the web3 development experience within the Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Adding to the portfolio of successful collaborations, Horizon and Polygon have already seen success with their web3 trading card game, Skyweaver. Developed on Polygon PoS for its scalability, environmental sustainability, and transaction speed, it was designed to provide an intuitive experience for its players, many of whom were new to web3. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Horizon is a long-standing collaborator in the Polygon ecosystem, and integrating their Sequence Wallet and developer stack into Polygon Supernets marks another significant stride in building web3 infrastructure on Polygon," shares Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon Labs.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Supernets</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Supernets, currently at its test version v0.9, represents a crucial development phase for the Polygon community. This version is a significant step towards the finasl release v1.0, reflecting the maturation of the product suite. It's important to bear in mind that this is a test release and may come with certain limitations, including breaking changes and lack of backward compatibility. While users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the new features, they should approach this version strictly as a test iteration.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Some of the key features in v0.9 are expanded allowlists and transaction blocklists, staking and token separation support, NFT bridge support, and enhanced transaction fee management. These additions bring the "Super networks" vision of Polygon Supernets a step closer to realization, introducing new core contracts and consensus client primitives. The MVP stage of the protocol now boasts expanded bridge transaction allowances, the introduction of MATIC staking, and support for different ERC tokens, among others.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Given the inherent risks associated with a test release, the Polygon team has undertaken a comprehensive source code audit to ensure the product's reliability and security. However, the final release version will undoubtedly carry more stability and an array of new features, bringing us one step closer to a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Notably, Horizon and Polygon Labs are also offering more support routes for brands and developers to penetrate the Web3 ecosystem. The provision of credits for projects developed on Polygon Supernets with Sequence further helps out aspiring developers who may just be starting out in the ecosystem. Horizon's all-in-one Sequence stack simplifies web3 development and content creation while enhancing user experience, making web3 technology more accessible.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On a wider scale, Polygon Labs, renowned for developing Ethereum scaling solutions for the Polygon protocols, has achieved notable milestones since its inception. As a testament to its impact, it has seen over 261 million unique addresses, 1.4 million smart contracts created, and 2.7 billion total transactions. Major web3 projects and corporations, such as Aave, Uniswap, Robinhood, and Stripe, have found a home in the existing Polygon network. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Cloud, the crypto exchange's cloud services arm, recently announced a partnership with Chainlink Network to expand its presence in the decentralized sphere.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As part of the collaboration, Coinbase Cloud will serve as a node operator, contributing its extensive experience and infrastructure to the Chainlink Network.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Cloud, the crypto exchange's cloud services arm, recently announced a partnership with Chainlink Network to expand its presence in the decentralized sphere.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As part of the collaboration, Coinbase Cloud will serve as a node operator, contributing its extensive experience and infrastructure to the Chainlink Network. This strategic partnership is expected to boost the multi-chain ecosystem by delivering high-quality data for Web3 applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chainlink Network is renowned as a leading oracle solution and Web3 services platform. It forms a crucial bridge between blockchain-based smart contracts and external data and systems, seamlessly connecting the evolving Web3 and the traditional Web2 worlds. Chainlink's decentralized oracle networks (DONs) source, format, and deliver real-world data to smart contracts, thereby significantly enhancing the transparency and efficiency of on-chain economies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To date, the Chainlink Network has been a key enabler of a significant amount of economic activity, with over $7T in transaction value facilitated and more than 7.4 billion data points delivered on-chain. The services offered by Chainlink are broad-ranging and include Price Feeds, VRF, Proof of Reserve, Automation, Functions, and CCIP. By deciding to join as a node operator, Coinbase Cloud is poised to contribute towards maintaining the security and reliability of these services provided by Chainlink.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Cloud is a secure and robust blockchain infrastructure platform that empowers developers with the necessary tools and services to create, deploy, and scale their blockchain applications. The platform offers a vast range of features. It provides staking services for individual investors, enterprises, and institutions, facilitating users to earn rewards for offering security and services to Proof of Stake networks. The platform's Wallet as a Service (WaaS) is a turnkey solution for building and managing secure crypto wallets, featuring essential components like key management, hot/cold storage, and multi-factor authentication. Developers also have access to the Coinbase Pay SDK, simplifying the integration of crypto payments into their applications and supporting a broad array of cryptocurrencies and payment methods.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase Cloud also offers a scalable Node solution for running nodes on various blockchain networks, a crucial element for participation in these networks.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, staking has emerged as a compelling way to receive more tokens while securing the blockchain network. DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), Binance Coin (BNB), and Polkadot (DOT) are among the tokens that offer staking programs with enticing benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By actively participating in these programs, users have the opportunity to earn commissions on token purchases in MIYAGI, enjoy a 3.5% APY with BNB, and delve into the dynamic Polkadot staking system. These opportunities provide a pathway for users to engage with the crypto ecosystem and capitalize on the potential rewards of staking.</p>
<p>The New Presale Meme Coin Fostering Growth Through Referrals!</p>
<p>The DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI) team has recently unveiled their plans for an upcoming Token Referral Program&mdash;a new initiative aimed at rewarding community members for their active involvement. This captivating program allows users to connect their wallets and generate unique referral codes, which they can then share with friends, family, and digital acquaintances.</p>
<p>By using these codes, individuals can earn a generous 10% commission on every purchase of MIYAGI tokens, effectively acknowledging their contributions. This straightforward opportunity not only allows users to bolster their MIYAGI holdings but also plays a role in driving the overall success of the token's ecosystem.</p>
<p>BNB Offers Stakers a 3.5% APY!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supporting the Binance blockchain network with their staked BNB, users not only play a crucial role in fortifying the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network's security but also enjoy the benefits of a 3.5% APY. By loaning their tokens to the exchange, users enable the network to validate transactions tirelessly, fuel decentralized governance, and enhance overall robustness.</p>
<p>In return for their trust, stakers are handsomely rewarded with tokens, serving as an enticing incentive to keep their tokens staked for the long haul. The beauty of staking BNB lies in the myriad variations and possibilities it offers, each presenting a unique twist to this clever game.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discovering the Dynamic Realm of Polkadot</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT), a sophisticated NPoS blockchain, relies on these validators to verify transactions and safeguard its network. With a more distributed and decentralized network, the chances of successful attacks by hackers are greatly reduced!</p>
<p>DOT holders have a variety of ways to engage with the Polkadot staking system. Whether you join a nomination pool to share rewards and penalties, become a nominator to handpick reliable validators, or even run your own nomination pool with competent validators, the options are plenty. And if you simply want to stake your cryptocurrency and join in on the action, that's an option too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staking in the world of cryptocurrencies offers a great opportunity to unlock rewards and enhance holdings. DogeMiyagi, Binance Coin, and Polkadot stand out as tokens that provide enticing staking programs with unique benefits. By actively participating in these programs, users can earn an incredible selection of high-value commissions. These avenues not only allow users to capitalize on the potential rewards but also contribute to the growth and success of the respective ecosystems.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you a cat lover and a crypto enthusiast? Look no further than Big Eyes Coin (BIG) - the first and only cat-themed meme coin in the market, launched by the BIG team in late 2022. With its unique feline-inspired design and innovative features, Big Eyes Coin offers a perfect investment opportunity for those looking to join the cat crew and potentially earn a significant amount of money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Purrfect Opportunity for Cat Lovers</p>
<p>With big sparkling eyes, Big Eyes Coin hit the crypto presale market on 20th August 2022. The excitement surrounding its native currency, BIG, has been palpable in the crypto world for the past 8 months. To date, Big Eyes Coin has completed 12 stages of presale and raised more than $35.5 million. In the current 13th stage, a BIG token costs $0.00053, which is a remarkable increase of over 400% from its initial stage.</p>
<p>But the excitement doesn't stop there. The Big Eyes Coin team has recently issued Loot Boxes at varying affordable prices. These boxes contain BIG tokens worth up to $1 million and unique NFT cards that can be minted and traded. The distinctive feature of these loot boxes is that they are designed in a way not to cause any financial loss to the investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Big Eyes Coin presale is quickly approaching its end on June 3rd, the team has announced a 300% bonus to investors who use the END300 code, further enhancing the deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roadmap to Success&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, the project team made a BIG announcement revealing the launch date of the BIG tokens. According to that, the BIG tokens will be launched on the Uniswap crypto exchange platform on June 15. Additionally, the BIG team has plans to list the tokens on 13 other exchanges to increase the accessibility and visibility of the BIG tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Casino With 4000+ Games&nbsp;</p>
<p>To drive up excitement before the launch on June 15, the BIG team has announced the launch of a casino with more than 4,000 games. The Casino will become fully operational on 29th August and feature exclusive Play to Earn (P2E) games. Participation in the gaming and betting services will be limited to BIG token holders, which is expected to drive demand for and increase the value of the BIG Eyes Coin post-launch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Big Eyes Coin team plans to expand its presence beyond cryptocurrencies by developing innovative and exclusive NFTs. The BIG team has outlined plans for the creation of Spurr Store, which will enable users to buy and sell digital assets, helping to make Big Eyes Coin a top virtual marketplace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Success Mantra&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of Big Eyes Coin can be attributed to the unwavering support of its community, which has been a top priority for the team from the beginning of the project.&nbsp; By involving the community in the development and promotion of the project, the team has been able to create a strong and loyal following. To achieve this, Big Eyes Coin has hosted 17 games and gifted valuable prizes to its community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has also pledged 5% of its total supply to save the oceans and has already donated nearly $16,000 to charities, demonstrating its social responsibility. Last but not least, to retain this hard-earned loyal community, the Big Eyes Coin team is using a no-fee, no-tax policy policy approach.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are looking for a business opportunity where you can invest less and earn a significant amount of money, then Big Eyes Coin is an ideal option for you.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto markets operate remarkably differently from mainstream financial markets. On the one hand, coins like Bitcoin have serious underpinning in seeking to decentralize the global financial system and whatnot. On the other hand, memecoins operate as literal jokes that utilize internet meme popularity. Well, at least that was the case for the first one to break out, DogeCoin. </p>
<p>Due to Dogecoin's success, many memecoins have emerged with varying degrees of success. DigiToads (TOADS) and Pepe token are new entrants to the scene, fast getting on the radar of crypto enthusiasts. The fact that there are now multiple memecoin options also speaks volumes about the dynamism of this industry. </p>
<p>DigiToads and PEPE Are Dominating</p>
<p>These memecoins are different standard-bearers of this subsector. DigiToads seeks to add utility to the memecoin scene by operating as a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming token. The game revolves around a nature-themed metaverse swamp that is full of adventure. DigiToads has only recently launched its token sale and has already raised over $3.2 million.</p>
<p>A metaverse gaming ecosystem adds more dynamism to the concept of a memecoin. In line with the name, the game is based on toad avatars as they seek to battle for their precious swamp habitat. The project also has NFT collectibles to tap into another popular aspect of crypto gaming. These in-game collectibles increase engagement and can be collected as players navigate the game and nurture their toads.</p>
<p>The Pepe the Frog meme is one of the most famous memes online, especially in right wing circles. It features a picture of a frog that is sometimes skeptical or nonchalant, with different meme inscriptions on the image. Well, there is now a Pepecoin inspired by this famous token, and it is quickly gaining traction in cryptocurrency circles. </p>
<p>DigiToads is keen on building its utility aspect as compared to other memecoins. There is much to work with in the gaming sector, where the blockchain has yet to achieve its potential fully. By combining the hype of a memecoin and the enduring popularity of a quality game, its creators are looking to build a more stable platform.</p>
<p>The fact that these projects, based on funny-looking amphibians, are now some of the most popular memecoins speaks to the dynamism of this sector. Memecoin popularity is based on the notoriety of memes in popular culture. It is noteworthy that DigiToads is trying to implement a virtual metaverse gaming ecosystem over and above its memecoin essence. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>DOGE Rose But TOADS Has More Upsides</p>
<p>Memecoins take inspiration from internet memes and the viral humor they carry. Amid Bitcoin's rise as a scarce transformative asset with solid principles, Dogecoin was more of a parody coin whose creators had little intention of having it as a major cryptocurrency. A decade later, Dogecoin and other meme coins are an established component of the crypto sector, with several coins with a combined market capitalization of hundreds of billions of dollars. </p>
<p>The astronomical rise of Dogecoin came after a seemingly humorous tweet by Elon Musk in 2019 and several times in the next few years. Musk already had tens of millions of followers on Twitter with significant name recognition on Twitter. He would use phrases like 'one word: Doge' or post the Dogecoin logo, a Shiba Inu dog, as an unstoppable sandstorm. Without a doubt, Elon's promotional activity has been a focal point in Dogecoin's popularity. </p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts carried the joke, and Dogecoin soon became one of the most popular cryptocurrencies out there. The coin appreciated more than 1000% in the middle of a crypto rally of 2020-2021 before tapering off. Shiba Inu coin piggybacked on the popularity of Dogecoin, and the two have since become the notable memecoins of this crypto era. Shiba </p>
<p>Nowadays, a memecoin refers to coins that fall under the broad umbrella of projects with a humorous or fun tinge. Many projects with the memecoin label have serious development teams behind them. &nbsp;DigiToads is an example of this approach by building on what DogeCoin and SHIB achieved but with the advantage of utility. DOGE may still be the biggest stablecoin, but TOADS could have more upside, given its actual use cases. </p>
<p>TOADS: The Upcoming Meme King? </p>
<p>The role of memecoins in the cryptocurrency industry is mixed. Some look at them as a hilarious spin on established crypto names like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For memecoin traders, they represent legitimate investment opportunities. Famous personalities like Elon Musk can instantly change the price of a memecoin with a tweet. </p>
<p>Some memecoins have tried to strike a balance between the two polar ends of crypto development. That's where the likes of TOADS come in. TOADS is a memecoin but provides the utility of a P2E gaming token with a vibrant gaming ecosystem in tow. The beauty of this industry is that it has something for just about everyone. </p>

<p>Unus Sed Leo (LEO) is making waves in the cryptocurrency market due to its low volatility and strong position against price manipulation. The Risk/Reward Gauge of Unus Sed Leo (LEO) indicates that the token has a relatively stable price, providing investors with a sense of security.

<p>However, Stellar (XLM) faced strong opposition, leading to a bearish engulfing candlestick formation. This recent rejection has temporarily halted the ascent of the Stellar (XLM) price. As a lot of charts are showing bearish signs for Stellar (XLM), now is a good time to stay away from Stellar (XTM) as it shows bearish signs. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the FDIC, blamed Signature Bank&rsquo;s involvement in the crypto industry for its ultimate collapse. </p>
<p>In a recent speech before the House Committee on Financial Services, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chairman blamed Signature Bank&rsquo;s reliance on uninsured deposits from the crypto industry and its exposure to the events that took place in 2022 for its demise.</p>
<p>Martin Gruenberg acknowledged the FDIC&rsquo;s bank supervision could have been more substantial. He conceded the agency did not act fast enough to prevent crisis from spreading through Signature&rsquo;s operations.</p>
<p>Chairman Gruenberg added that Signature&rsquo;s lack of risk management procedures and poor governance put the bank in a position where it could not manage liquidity in a crisis, making it unable to meet large withdrawal requests. Withdrawals were triggered by fears about Signature Bank&rsquo;s solvency and involvement in the volatile crypto sector.</p>
<p>Some bank executives tried to blame rising interest rates as the reason for its collapse, but Gruenberg argued that no bank could survive a run of such speed and magnitude.</p>
Signature&rsquo;s Closure Unrelated to Crypto: NYDFS
<p>In March, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced that its decision to shut down the bank was not influenced by its involvement in the crypto industry. Signature worked extensively with several crypto firms, with an estimated 30% of its deposits originating from the industry.</p>
<p>Signature came under scrutiny during the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX when it emerged the exchange held accounts with the bank. At the time, Signature said these accounts represented less than 0.1% of its overall deposits, adding that it planned to reduce around $10 billion in deposits emanating from digital asset clients.</p>
<p>The bank said by reducing its ties with digital asset clients; it would bring its crypto-related deposits down to between 15-20% of its total.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The third iteration of the Voyager bankruptcy plan has finally been approved by the court. According to the terms, affected customers can expect to recover up to 35% of their claims.</p>
Voyager Liquidating To Refund Customers
<p>In a significant development for users affected by the Voyager Digital Ltd. bankruptcy case, the court has approved a plan that allows customers to recoup a substantial portion of their frozen funds. According to the latest reports, users may be able to recover up to 35.7% of their initial claims, providing some much-needed relief for those impacted by the unfortunate situation.</p>
<p>This marks a positive turning point for Voyager Digital, a crypto brokerage platform that experienced financial difficulties leading to the freezing of customer accounts.&nbsp;</p>
Attempt No.1: The FTX Debacle
<p>The defunct company has had two failed attempts in the past to refund its customers. Back in September 2022, FTX had placed a winning bid of $1.4 billion on the bankrupt company&rsquo;s assets. However, with FTX also going under soon, the deal fell through. Reportedly, if the deal had been fully realized and FTX had not collapsed, creditors would have been able to reclaim 72% of their account values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crypto exchange even went as far as to sue Voyager for $445.8 million in January 2023, alleging that loan repayments made by Voyager in 2022 are subject to clawback due to their timing, occurring right before FTX's bankruptcy.</p>
Attempt No.2: Binance Backs Out
<p>The second chance at redemption came Voyager&rsquo;s way with Binance.US and a $1 billion acquisition deal. However, there was significant legal pushback on this plan from the bankruptcy court, and after a lot of back and forth, the deal finally fell through in late April, resulting in Voyager looking into liquidation options.&nbsp;</p>
Attempt No.3: Finally Approved
<p>The bankrupt crypto brokerage firm finally got lucky on its third try when Judge Michael Wiles of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved its bankruptcy plan to liquidate on May 17.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the terms of the plan, Voyager will begin repaying customers' frozen accounts in the near future. The approved proposal ensures that 35.7% of the initial claims will be distributed to the affected users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voyager has stated that as of May 8, it held $1.33 billion in recoverable assets, with $629.8 million being immediately available for recovery while facing claims totaling $1.8 billion. There is also a possibility that the firm may recover its funds frozen in the also-bankrupt crypto hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web3, the next epoch of the internet, is built upon revolutionary technology called blockchain. As this new era unfolds, an important debate has emerged within the crypto industry: Will there be a winner-take-all scenario among blockchains, or can multiple blockchains coexist? This ongoing discussion, known as the multichain hypothesis, has profound implications for the future of Web3. In this thought leadership article, we will delve into the significance of blockchain coexistence and explore how Poly Network, a leading interoperability solution, is playing a pivotal role in enabling the benefits of multichain synergy.</p>
<p>Diversifying Blockchain Infrastructure In recent years, the blockchain landscape has witnessed the development of diverse infrastructure layers, adding richness and variety to the previous Ethereum layer-1 (L1) monopoly.

By seamlessly connecting disparate blockchains, interoperability solutions like Poly Network enable the aggregation of benefits across ecosystems. Through the establishment of secure and efficient bridges, users can seamlessly transfer assets, data, and value across multiple chains, unleashing the true potential of interconnectedness.</p>

Each blockchain can leverage its unique strengths, fostering collaboration and innovation within the ecosystem. Users benefit from a broader range of options and opportunities, enabling them to tailor their experiences to their specific needs. With Poly Network's cutting-edge interoperability solutions, users gain unprecedented control and ownership over their digital assets and data, which transcends the limitations of individual chains.</p>
<p>Maximizing Web3 Potential: Multichain Synergies with Poly Network</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Touted as digital silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold, Litecoin has suddenly awakened, putting on nearly 20% in 4 days.</p>
<p>Like a blast from the past Litecoin has perhaps put itself into the reckoning again after a short, sharp rally. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin has a halving where the block rewards for miners are cut in half. This halving event is now on the horizon, and is expected to take place in July or August of this year.</p>
<p>Litecoin's recent surge of 20% exemplifies the growing interest in diversifying cryptocurrency portfolios. As investors become more sophisticated, they recognize the need to explore beyond Bitcoin's dominance and explore other avenues.&nbsp;</p>
Faster and more efficient than Bitcoin
<p>One of Litecoin's key differentiators lies in its technology. Created by Charlie Lee, a former Google engineer, Litecoin boasts faster block generation times and a more efficient mining algorithm compared to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This distinction makes Litecoin capable of processing transactions four times faster, offering increased scalability and improved transaction speeds. These features position Litecoin as a possible solution for everyday transactions, where speed and efficiency are paramount.</p>
<p>Litecoin's resilience owes much to its community, which has weathered the challenges of the last few years, fostering a dedicated network of enthusiasts who actively promote and develop the currency.&nbsp;</p>
The Litecoin price history
<p>The Litecoin price is currently sitting at $92.60. This is a strong area of resistance, and should $LTC manage to flip this into support, we could see a sustained run that could take the token a lot higher.</p>
<p>Back in 2017 at the height of that crypto bull run, $LTC rose as high as $373 before sinking into the ensuing awful bear market that saw the token plumb the depths to around $21.</p>
<p>A rally into mid 2019 saw Litecoin get back to $145, before the bears took over once again and Litecoin sank again to its lowest point at $20. From here it began its most glorious ascent yet, reaching $413 in May 2021.</p>
<p>This was the first top for this particular bull run, and where Bitcoin surpassed this, Litecoin was only able to hit $295 for its second top at the end of the bull run in November of 2021.</p>
<p>Whether Litecoin is able to see such glory days again is a moot point. However, with its halving approaching it could potentially see some strong gains.</p>
