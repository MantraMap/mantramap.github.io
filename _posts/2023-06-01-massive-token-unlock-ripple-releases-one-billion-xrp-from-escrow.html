A Brief On Ripple Escrow System Ripple developed the escrow system for locking XRP tokens in 2017. The firm locked 55 billion XRP in a “series of escrows” on the ledger, making up 55% of the token supply.  Each escrow contains 1 billion XRP, which the blockchain firm plans to unlock monthly over 55 months.  According to XRPL.org, the aim is to provide predictability to the token supply. As such,  the ledger mechanics are enforced by consensus to enable the release of 1 billion tokens at the scheduled time.  The blockchain company releases the token periodically in a controlled method. This serves as a measure of maintaining stability in the XRP market. The latest unlock of XRP is part of Ripple’s vision of satisfying investors’ demands and supporting the growing XRP ecosystem.
