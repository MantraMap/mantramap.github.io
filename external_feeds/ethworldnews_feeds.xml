<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The FTX founder published a pre-mortem report claiming Alameda Research was the victim of a coordinated attack.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried said he believes FTX US is solvent and holds over $350 million in net cash to repay customers if the platform was rebooted today.</li><li>U.S. prosecutors charged SBF with fraud and money laundering in the billion-dollar crash of his Bahamas-based crypto exchange. </li></ul>



<p>Disgraced FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried published his personal thoughts on the factors that drove his cryptocurrency exchange and $32 billion empire to ruin in November 2022. In a “pre-mortem” report released on Substack, Bankman-Fried pointed to three reasons why Alameda’s contagion pulled down FTX.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>$100 Billion Balance Sheet, $8 Billion In Leverage, $7 Billion On-Hand Liquidity&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Firstly, SBF said his trading giant Alameda Research boasted a balance sheet with a new value of around $100 billion in 2021. The company formerly led by Caroline Ellison also supposedly had $7 billion in liquid assets and $8 billion in debt from leverage trading. </p>



<p>A CoinDesk article from November 2022 revealed that Alameda’s books were propped up mostly by illiquid assets like FTT, the exchange token created by FTX out of thin air. </p>



<h2>Market Exposure And Coordinated Attack</h2>



<p>SBF added that Alameda’s assets tanked around 80% in value following “board market crashes” involving defunct entities like Celsius and Three Arrows Capital to name a few. Bankman-Fried also blamed Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for precipitating an attack that made his trading giant insolvent in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fallen crypto tycoon claimed that contagion from Alameda after CZ’s purported attack pushed FTX international to insolvency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, complaints filed by the&nbsp; Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/">alleged</a> that Alameda was already insolvent by May 2022 and heavily relied on FTX customer deposits to stay afloat.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SBF Insists FTX US Is Solvent</h2>



<p>Thursday’s report said that it’s “ridiculous that FTX US users haven’t been made whole”, echoing previous claims from Sam Bankman-Fried that FTX US remained solvent despite ties to the Bahamas-based international crypto exchange, </p>



<p>According to SBF, FTX US had more than $350 million in net cash before bankruptcy CEO John Ray III took over on November 13. Bankman-Fried opined that the U.S.-based exchange could repay customers if the platform was rebooted today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried also pledged all of his personal assets to customers, though he did not specify the value of these assets or where they’re held. </p>



<h2>FTX Could Have Raised Liquidity Says Sam Bankman-Fried </h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried maintains that FTX was in a position to raise liquidity despite $5 billion in withdrawals and a massive hole in the company’s balance sheet. SBF added that $4 billion in LOIs was raised post-chapter 11 filing on November 12.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If FTX had been given a few weeks to raise the necessary liquidity, I believe it would have been able to make customers substantially whole. I didn’t realize at the time that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell—via pressure to instate Mr. Ray and file Chapter 11, including for solvent companies like FTX US–would potentially quash those efforts. I still think that, if FTX International were to reboot today, there would be a real possibility of making customers substantially whole. And even without that, there are significant assets available for customers.</p></blockquote>



<p>Between subtle jabs at CEO John Ray III and claims that FTX still holds billions of dollars in assets enough to repay customers, Sam Bankman-Fried also <a href="https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview" rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a> his estimates are largely based on general data prior to his resignation as FTX chief.</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried is set to stand trial on eight counts of criminal charges starting October 2023. So far, top FTX lieutenants like Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-nishad-singh-deal-sdny-prosecutors/">Nishad Singh</a> met with U.S. prosecutors to discuss plea deals. Ellison and Wang already <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/12/23/caroline-ellison-admits-she-and-bankman-fried-conspired-to-steal-from-ftx-customers-and-mislead-investors-reports-say/" rel="noopener">admitted</a> to fraud at FTX and Alameda.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Crypto broker Genesis reportedly owes more than $3 billion to its creditors.&nbsp;</li><li>These liabilities have prompted parent firm DCG to explore selling assets to raise money.&nbsp;</li><li>DCG’s venture portfolio boasts 200 crypto projects including banks and exchanges in 35 countries.&nbsp;</li><li>Genesis’ $900 million debt to Gemini has led to an online spat between the founders of both firms.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The uncovering of $3 billion worth of liabilities has become the latest development in Genesis’ financial woes. The crypto broker reportedly owes more than $3 billion to its creditors, which include crypto exchange Gemini. The broker’s financial predicament has forced parent firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) to look for ways to raise money.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>DCG reportedly exploring asset sales</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb22bfab-ef05-48ce-83de-ebb904a35dca" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a>, the Digital Currency Group is trying to raise funds for its wholly-owned subsidiary Genesis. People familiar with the matter have revealed that the crypto conglomerate is exploring selling assets from its massive venture portfolio in order to raise fresh cash. The portfolio boasts a vast collection of crypto exchanges, banks, media firms, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCG owns Grayscale Investments, which issues the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The crypto empire also includes popular media house Coindesk, as well as investments in popular projects including Circle, Dune Analytics, etc. The <a href="https://dcg.co/portfolio/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dcg.co/portfolio/" rel="nofollow noopener">portfolio</a> is spread over 35 countries and is reportedly worth $500 million. </p>



<p>The Digital Currency Group is now tasked with raising funds for Genesis, whose debts exceed all the estimates that have been reported until now. The parent firm itself owes more than $450 million to Genesis Capital, in addition to a $1.1 billion promissory note that was issued to bail out the latter when crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Genesis’ financial woes have brought DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert into the limelight. Silbert has been criticized for his subsidiary’s non-repayments, most notably by Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder and President of the crypto exchange Gemini. Both executives have been involved in a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-barry-silberts-resignation-dcg/" rel="noreferrer noopener">public spat</a>&nbsp;over the $900 million that Genesis owes to Gemini’s customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The crypto lender&#8217;s office in Bulgaria was raided on suspicions of fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion.</li><li>Local authorities also claimed to have evidence proving that a Nexo user financed terrorism.</li><li>The company said they&#8217;re cooperating with law enforcement and assured users that the uncertain period &#8220;too shall pass&#8221;.</li></ul>



<p>Nexo’s Bulgarian division was raided by local law enforcement on Thursday due to suspicions that the crypto lender facilitated fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion. According to the official report, Bulgarian police are investigating the company’s domestic entity that boasts operational functions including payroll and customer support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to fraud and tax evasion allegations, local authorities also believe a Nexo user financed terrorism by leveraging the cryptocurrency platform. The statement from Bulgaria’s prosecutor&#8217;s office said over 300 law enforcement agents are part of the investigation to “neutralize the criminal activity” at the giant crypto lender.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Evidence has been collected that a person who used the platform and transferred cryptocurrencies has been officially declared a terrorist financing person. </p></blockquote>



<p>On Thursday, Nexo <a href="https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1613477472586338305" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> a Twitter thread to inform users of the company’s cooperation with local authorities. The crypto lender noted that regulators have adopted a “kick first, ask questions later approach” toward digital asset companies in light of recent crashes and crackdowns in the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding claims of terrorism financing, the lender highlighted that crypto is not suited for illicit purposes and can be tracked across immutable blockchain records.</p>



<p>“Crypto is actually terrible for illicit purposes &#8211; using Chainalysis, for example, we know the history of the asset while it is being deposited and have a good understanding of the address to which it is withdrawn. This is more difficult with fiat and requires other techniques”</p>

<h2>Nexo Solvency Draws Doubt After Vauld Rejection Buy-Out Deal</h2>



<p>The crypto lender moved to acquire troubled crypto lender and rival entity Vauld. Vauld shut down withdrawal amid contagion from Terra’s crash after users pulled roughly $200 million from the platform. The crypto lender also cut headcount by 30% to redirect resources towards restructuring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On December 26, 2022, Nexo <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/05/crypto-lender-nexo-offers-to-buy-embattled-rival-vauld.html" rel="noopener">submitted</a> a final proposal to take over Vauld. However, Vauld’s creditors rejected the offer, claiming a lack of comprehensive due diligence and solvency assessment report. Concerns about Nexo’s financial health supposedly erupted following Vauld’s rejection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crypto lender currently under investigation by Bulgarian police also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/breaking-nexo-is-shutting-down-its-u-s-business/">shuttered</a> its U.S. business in December last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Layer 1 blockchain Avalanche has&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1613235554711400448?s=20&amp;t=E0UYS2T7yutSfJEYd8oq5w" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a>&nbsp;that it has partnered up with cloud computing giant Amazon Web Services to bring scalable blockchain solutions to enterprises and governments around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>AWS now supports Avalanche’s dApp ecosystem and infrastructure</strong></h2>



<p>According to an&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/ava-labs-and-aws-bring-scalable-blockchain-solutions-to-enterprises-and-governments-295040a34263" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a>&nbsp;from Avalanche, Amazon Web Services now fully supports the blockchain’s infrastructure and decentralized applications ecosystem. This includes one-click node deployment through the AWS Marketplace, and AWS GovCloud for FedRAMP compliance use cases which is a prerequisite for enterprises and governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to the partnership, developers will be able to use AWS to deploy scalable, fault-tolerant, and compliant offerings, all while efficiently reducing compliance expenses.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It has been a huge boon for both individual and enterprise developers to be able to spin up nodes and test networks on the fly with AWS in whatever legal jurisdiction makes the most sense for them” </p><cite>Emin Gün Sirer, Founder and CEO of Ava Labs.</cite></blockquote>

<p>The partnership also makes Ava Labs a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN), which paves the way for customers to deploy custom offerings on AWS. Ava Labs has indicated that it may add&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/avalanche-290m-incentive-program-to-boost-subnets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnet</a>&nbsp;deployment as a managed service to the AWS Marketplace to help both firms launch custom Subnets. This will include a feature to distribute validators securing the Subnet across different regions and availability zones to improve robustness.</p>



<p>As for the developers, the partnership will bring more flexibility, in addition to the added strength of the network. AWS and Ava Labs are also collaborating on events for developers and entrepreneurs to make building on Avalanche easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avalanche&#8217;s native token&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$AVAX</a>&nbsp;has gained more than 15% since the news came out. The token is currently trading at $14.22. Traders have scrambled to buy the token, resulting in a 16% increase in its trading volume over the past three hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Landis Rath &amp; Cobb lawyers stated the recovery claim during a bankruptcy hearing on Wednesday</li><li>The $5 billion in question was reclaimed in &#8220;cash, liquid crypto, and liquid investment securities&#8221;, per the court hearing.</li><li>FTX bankruptcy CEO John Ray previously tagged the company&#8217;s recovery efforts at around $1.2 billion in December 2022. </li></ul>



<p>Attorneys from Landis Rath and Cobb told a judge that FTX recovered some $5 billion as bankruptcy hearings for the defunct crypto exchange continued on Wednesday. According to Landis Rath and Cobb lawyer Adam Landis, the company reclaimed the stated value in cash, liquid cryptocurrencies, and liquid investment securities. </p>



<p>FTX’s legal representatives noted that the latest recovery did not include approximately $425 million in customer crypto <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">seized</a> by Bahamian authorities in late December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, Wednesday’s court claim boosted the company’s recovered assets value by a considerable margin. On December 20, 2022, bankruptcy CEO John Ray III said the sunken crypto exchange had secured roughly $1.2 billion in value. Ray noted that loose accounting structures in Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire made it tricky to track down assets.</p>



<p>The latest clawback by the bankruptcy management under Ray could propel the estate’s holdings to over $7 billion, making more funds available for customers, creditors, and investors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Crypto Twitter Puzzled By Mystery $5 Billion Recovery&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Observers on Crypto Twitter were skeptical regarding claims of a massive $5 billion <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/11/ftx-has-recovered-5-billion-worth-of-liquid-assets-lawyers-say-bankman-fried-crypto.html" rel="noopener">recovery</a> by FTX’s bankruptcy team. Coinbase director Conor Grogan pointed out that on-chain wallets controlled by the defunct exchange held less than $4 billion in value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users also enquired whether or not the $5 billion in question included over $400 million in Robinhood shares seized by the Department of Justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crypto proponent Adam Cochran also speculated that Sam Bankman-Fried himself could be involved in the mystery recovery. The user noted that SBF supposedly offered Elon Musk $5 billion in equity to support his Twitter takeover.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>FTX Asks Judge To Ignore Celsius Precedent</h2>



<p>FTX attorneys filed a motion to redact all creditor information and protect customer privacy.. The request was opposed by media organizations including Bloomberg, the Financial Times, and the New York Times who argued in favor of the precedent set by Celsius.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Celsius’s bankruptcy proceedings <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-users-doxxed-bankruptcy-filing/">revealed</a> 14,000 pages of user information including account names and transaction histories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawyers representing the fallen crypto exchange suggested sealing customer data for a period of six months. FTX attorneys argued that this time will be sufficient for the court to assess the value of the data and whether it should be made public.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Voyager Digital was granted court approval allowing the defunct crypto broker to sell off some of its assets.</li><li>The deal was previously halted by an SEC inquiry. </li><li>Binance US will splash a whopping $1 billion as payment to Voyager, per previous reports.</li><li>The deal is still subject to a bankruptcy court hearing slated for March 2022.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance US received approval from a&nbsp; bankruptcy court to proceed with a deal geared toward purchasing assets under beleaguered cryptocurrency brokerage service Voyager Digital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both entities <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-voyager-digital-assets-1-billion/https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-voyager-digital-assets-1-billion/">agreed</a> to a massive $1 billion deal in late December 2022 as previously reported. However, an inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily blocked the deal from finalizing. The SEC <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sec-objects-binanceuss-deal-buy-voyager-digital-2023-01-04/" rel="nofollow noopener">questioned</a> whether the crypto exchange could indeed satisfy the financial requirements attached to the agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX’s sister firm Alameda research also filed a complaint against the deal, claiming that the agreement “ignores fundamental requirement and protections of the Bankruptcy code”. Voyager’s lawyers fired back at Alameda’s “hypocrisy and chutzpah”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Judge Issues Conditional Approval</h2>



<p>U.S. Judge Michael Wiles approved Voyager’s deal with the crypto exchange late on Tuesday, per the court filing. Judge Wiles ordered that the defunct crypto broker hold a vote with its creditors regarding plans to offload some assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, another hearing was scheduled for March 2 to finalize the agreement and consider the votes from Voyager’s creditors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the $1 billion purchase agreement could herald relief for Voyager customers frozen out of their crypto since July 2022. The crypto broker declared bankruptcy due to a liquidity crisis and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyager-digital-3ac-default-notice/">exposure</a> to fallen crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Terms of the deal with Binance US will allow Voyager customers to receive about 51% of their holdings stuck on the brokerage service.</p>



<h2>Binance CEO Gunning For Workforce Growth In 2023</h2>



<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the leading crypto exchange has plans to expand its team in 2023. The company boasted over 8,000 employees at the end of 2022, growing from 3,000 in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao noted that Binance could increase staff count by some 15-30% during a blockchain conference in Switzerland. The comments echoed previous remarks from CZ who noted that Binance has a war chest big enough to keep the lights on through a bear market.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Gala Games’ native token $GALA has gone up 142% over the past week according to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gala" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gala" rel="nofollow noopener">Coingecko</a>.</li><li>The play-to-earn platform recently announced the acquisition of Ember Entertainment, which had positively impacted the token’s price. </li><li>The platform has also partnered up with Hollywood superstars Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg.</li><li>Opportunistic traders have begun shorting the token while anticipating the momentum to die out. </li></ul>



<p>Gala Games, the popular blockchain-based pay-to-earn <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gala-games-attack-token-bleeds/">platform</a>, revealed multiple high-profile developments over the past couple of days. These developments have had a rather bullish effect on their native token $GALA. The ERC-20 token has gone from $0.023 all the way up to $0.045, within a span of 48 hours, marking an impressive bullish run of nearly 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gala Games acquires Ember Entertainment</strong></h2>



<p>Earlier today, Gala Games confirmed that it had&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames/status/1612610162304376832?t=XT8CW9cJ5OXA6ydB5yx_SQ&amp;s=19" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired</a>&nbsp;Ember Entertainment, the game studio behind the popular play-to-earn game The Walking Dead: Empires. Both parties were involved in the development of this game and rumors about the acquisition had been going around over the past few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The acquisition paves the way for Gala to onboard more than 20 million active users. According to an update provided by the platform, two high-priority games, Dragon Strike and Meow Match, are currently at the center of their attention. Both the games will be integrated into the platform’s layer 1 blockchain and use the native token $GALA as gas fees. According to the platform&#8217;s developers, 50% of the gas will be burned while the rest will be distributed among the node operators, founders, and partners of the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the acquisition, Gala Games also announced partnerships with popular Hollywood stars Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg. Furthermore, the GALA token will be used to power its flagship play-to-earn game&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames/status/1612565011909562378?s=20&amp;t=9Vgr8cf4C5_KQR1eXCdzkA" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Townstar</a>. All $TOWN tokens will be swapped for GALA at a 2:1 ratio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impressive bull run of GALA came to an end earlier today after opportunistic degen traders started shorting the token. The traders anticipated that the momentum of the news was set to run out and that the token would correct itself. Data from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gala/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>&nbsp;shows that the $GALA is currently trading at $0.042. The recent developments led its trading volume to skyrocket to levels which were last witnessed in March 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the letter, DCG&#8217;s CEO Barry Silbert acknowledged the current state of the market, which has led the company to reduce its workforce and wind down its wealth management subsidiary, HQ, which was incubated in 2020. Silbert also acknowledged the challenges facing the industry, which has seen a wave of fraud and criminal behavior that has damaged its reputation.</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, Silbert remains optimistic about the future, saying, &#8220;I hope this letter and the accompanying Q&amp;A that explains other developments and addresses some of the speculation about DCG – some of which is reasonable and some that is completely baseless and false – help to clarify our position.&#8221;</p>



<p>Barry Silbert went on to say that the industry must come together and work collaboratively in order to rebuild its credibility and reputation and that he believes DCG will emerge from this year a stronger company than ever before.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss said there&#8217;s no path forward as long as Barry Silbert remains CEO of Digital Currency Group.</li><li>The letter demanded that the DCG board out Silbert and install new management, while also accusing Silbert&#8217;s conglomerate of accounting fraud.</li><li>Tuesday&#8217;s letter was the latest in the spat between Gemini and DCG after Winklevoss publicly called out Silbert on January 2, 2023.</li></ul>



<p>President and Co-Founder of Gemini Cameron Winklevoss escalated the ongoing spat with Digital Currency Group CEO and Founder Barry Silbert, accusing Silbert of accounting fraud and demanding that the company’s board install new management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Winklevoss shared an open letter to the DCG board via Twitter on Tuesday, claiming that Genesis defrauded 340,000 Gemini Earn users and other creditors of roughly $1.67 billion by making “false statements and misrepresentations” regarding Genesis’s financial strength.&nbsp;Notably, Genesis is owned by Silbert&#8217;s DCG. </p>



<p>Bankrupt crypto broker Genesis reportedly cut a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet after lending $2.4 billion to crumbled crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Winklevoss goes on to accuse Silbert of doing nothing to address his company’s deteriorating books despite having “two legitimate options” to either restructure Genesis’s lending structure or fill the $1.2 billion hole left by 3AC’s crash.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>At that point in time, the Genesis loan book was approximately $8 billion, which means that the $1.2 billion loss from 3AC would account for roughly 15% of the loan book’s assets. A restructuring then could have addressed this shortfall to achieve a full recovery of assets for all lenders &#8211; including Earn users &#8211; in a short amount of time and give them direct access to liquidity. But Barry chose not to do this. He also chose not to fill the $1.2 billion hole. Instead, he pretended to.</p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to allegations of coordinated accounting fraud within Silbert’s mammoth company, Winklevoss also accused former Genesis CEO Michael Moro of making “false and misleading” statements. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/genesis-moro-steps-down-staff-cuts-3ac/">Moro</a> claimed that DCG “assumed certain liabilities of Genesis related to 3AC” on July 6, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCG agreed to a $1.1 billion promissory note with Genesis supposedly meant to stabilize the crypto broker. However, Winklevoss called the deal a “gimmick” that failed to address the company’s liquidity crunch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Gemini President Sees No Path Forward With Silbert Leading DCG</h2>



<p>Winklevoss opined that DCG requires new management for the benefit of all involved parties. In Tuesday’s open letter, Gemini’s President <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/10/billionaire-cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-removal-of-lying-barry-silbert-ceo-of-flailing-crypto-conglomerate-dcg/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/10/billionaire-cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-removal-of-lying-barry-silbert-ceo-of-flailing-crypto-conglomerate-dcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requested</a> that the DCG board immediately remove Barry Silbert as CEO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCB’s board has five members per information available on Crunchbase. The board members include Jim Robinson, Lawrence Lenihan, Matt Haris, Glenn Hutchins, and Rocky Motwani. </p>



<p>The group called Cameron&#8217;s letter a &#8220;desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt from&#8221; in a Twitter reply on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The letter came as the second public move from Winklevoss in a bid to push DCG into action and seemingly expose Sibert’s unwillingness to “find a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable. Gemini’s Co-Founder had previously called on Silbert in an open letter on January 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coinbase announced that it will be downsizing its workforce by around 20% or 950 employees, as part of a restructuring effort set to be completed by the end of Q2 2023</p>



<p>According to the company, the decision to restructure is a response to &#8220;ongoing market conditions impacting the crypto economy,&#8221; as stated in a filing with the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978823000003/coin-20230110.htm" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978823000003/coin-20230110.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </a></p>



<p>&#8220;While it is always painful to part ways with our fellow colleagues, there was no way to reduce our expenses significantly enough, without considering changes to headcount,” Armstrong said on a memo.</p>



<p>“The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry,” he said, adding there’s likely more “shoes to drop.” in an interview to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/coinbase-to-slash-20percent-of-workforce-in-second-major-round-of-job-cuts.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/coinbase-to-slash-20percent-of-workforce-in-second-major-round-of-job-cuts.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</p>



<p>“We may not have seen the last of it — there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to make sure that they’re following the rule&#8221;</p>



<p> “Long term that’s a good thing. But short term, there’s still a lot of market fear.” </p>



<p>The company anticipates that the restructuring process will cost between $149 million and $163 million, including cash charges of $58 million-$68 million related to employee severance. </p>



<p>This downsizing follows a similar round of job <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-operational-efficiency-plans/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-operational-efficiency-plans/">cuts </a>made last year when the crypto market was in a bear phase. CEO Brian Armstrong explained that the company had grown too quickly during the bull market, leading to the need to reduce expenses in order to increase the company&#8217;s chances of success in any market scenario. </p>



<p>&#8220;One of the crazy parts about our industry is that in any given year we might be growing 300-500% or -50%. It makes it incredibly challenging to plan and culturally to absorb so many people during up periods.” &#8211; CEO Armstrong previously stated on his Official Twitter Account.</p>



<p>In addition to job cuts, Coinbase will also be discontinuing several projects with a &#8220;lower probability of success.&#8221; </p>



<p>According to CoinDesk, nearly 27,000 jobs have been lost across the crypto industry since April 2020.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has been significantly impacted in recent months due to the fall of one of the industry&#8217;s major players, FTX. The incident has led to increased pressure and scrutiny on the sector, with some individuals, such as FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, being referred to as &#8220;unscrupulous actors&#8221; in the industry.</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Shares Increased 6% After the Announcement.</strong></h2>



<p>Shares of Coinbase saw a 6% increase in value after the company announced the job cuts.</p>



<p>While the move will result in a significant reduction in staff, it is expected to also bring cost savings for the company. Investors appear to be taking the news positively, with the stock seeing a significant boost in value following the announcement. </p>



<p>It should be noted that this kind of downsizing is not uncommon in crypto, where volatility is high, and the industry is constantly evolving. A few crypto companies have already announced layoffs, such as Crypto.Com, Gemini, Celsius, and others.</p>
