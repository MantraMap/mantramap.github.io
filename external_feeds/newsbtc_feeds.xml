					<description><![CDATA[Ripple has continued to revel in the glow of Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in favor of the crypto company, with many use cases being touted for its native token XRP. The most recent use case to surface is a Spot XRP ETF, and Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has quickly weighed in on the possibility of this happening.  How Possible Is A Spot XRP ETF? Seyffart, during an appearance on Tony Edward’s Thinking Crypto Podcast, explained that XRP would need to be listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) before the SEC can approve a Spot XRP ETF.  Related Reading: Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly Following Ripple’s Win Over SEC This argument stems from the SEC’s requirement for a regulated market of significant size in the underlying asset. Relatively, exchanges looking to list a Spot Bitcoin ETF are, in hopes of gaining approval, relying on the fact that the CME Bitcoin futures, which happen to be a regulated market, provide significant size to provide necessary data and insights for any spot market.  So Seyffart also believes that any Spot XRP ETF application will also need to fulfill the requirement of the token having a significant market size that can be used to provide any data and insights needed to prevent fraud and market manipulation. To achieve this and easily get the SEC’s approval, listing XRP futures on a prominent derivative exchange like CME would be the way to go, in his opinion.  Despite his remarks, Seyffart isn’t so optimistic about a Spot XRP ETF launching anytime as, according to him, this isn’t something he sees “materializing in the foreseeable future.” Token price continues to fall as euphoria wanes &#124; Source: XRPUSDT on Tradingview.com Little Or No Demand Is A Hindrance Another notable highlight from Seyffart’s remarks was when he suggested that there was little or no demand for an XRP ETF, something which he believes is integral if we are to see any ETF application.  However, there is reason to believe this assumption may not be outrightly correct, as certain figures suggest an increasing demand for XRP, notably among institutional investors.  Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens Last month, a report stated how XRP’s sales had jumped significantly this year, with over 2.22 billion XRP sold since the beginning of the year.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin market continues to reveal trends and patterns, vital for both long-term holders and short-term speculators. Notably, since Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $69,000, speculators, who play a pivotal role in the market, now hold less of the cryptocurrency. This insight comes from prominent analytics firm Glassnode in its &#8220;The Week On-Chain&#8221; newsletter, which delves into the market&#8217;s dynamics and potential implications. Bitcoin Stagnation And Role Of Short-Term Holders The Bitcoin market has witnessed a prolonged period marked by relatively steady BTC price action. This phase has sown seeds of discontent among market participants, prompting speculation about potential downside risks. Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin’s Market If Greenlit So far, the asset only hovers between $29,000 and $25,000 price points creating a tug-of-war between the bulls and bears in that price zones. A noteworthy shift in the Bitcoin market is the dwindling enthusiasm of its short-term traders, commonly referred to as speculators. This group, typically driven by the prospects of swift gains, seems to be re-evaluating its stance, perhaps deterred by the recent lack of significant price movement. Glassnode points out that the market share of these short-term holders has ebbed to a mere 2.56 million BTC. This stands in stark contrast to their presence in October 2021, right before Bitcoin soared to its record high. Yet, while these speculators recede, long-term holders, often viewed as the bedrock of the Bitcoin community, are seemingly undeterred. Their stronghold over the currency is tightening, with a current hold of 14.6M BTC, the highest ever recorded. The report noted: Overall, this suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings. A Market Teetering On Decisions The distinction in purchase prices between the two investor classes has been highlighted as a potential concern. According to the newsletter, Short-term speculators, having bought at a higher average price of $28,600, might be more susceptible to incurring losses with even a modest dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. On the other hand, long-term investors, with an aggregate purchase price substantially lower at around $20,300, seem more cushioned against market volatility. This variance in purchasing prices, combined with the contrasting reactions of the two investor groups, paints a picture of a market in flux, divided between those who believe in Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term value and those swayed by its immediate price trajectories. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Key Indicators Suggest A Strong Case For More Losses Glassnode believes that &#8220;The separation between these two cost basis is an indicator that many recent buyers have a relatively elevated acquisition price.&#8221; Despite the current market uncertainty, an underlying sentiment that remains clear is the confidence of Bitcoin&#8217;s stalwarts. Their increasing hold suggests a steadfast belief in Bitcoin&#8217;s potential, even as speculators seem to waver amid its current price downturn.

					<description><![CDATA[Linda P. Jones has identified a life-changing buying opportunity for XRP, urging investors to capitalize on this moment. Jones, known for her works, &#8220;3 Steps to Quantum Wealth: The Wealth Heiress&#8217; Guide to Financial Freedom by Investing in Cryptocurrencies&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8217;re Already a Wealth Heiress, Now Think and Act Like One: 6 Practical Steps to Make It a Reality Now!&#8221; took to Twitter today, sharing her bullish perspective on several cryptocurrency assets. She fervently states, &#8220;Gave a wake up call to VIP Experience members today: If you&#8217;re not investing in XRP at $0.60, XDC at $0.06, ALGO at $0.10, XLM at $0.10…don&#8217;t come crying to me when they are higher!&#8221; Drawing attention to the present market valuations, she highlighted that many of these assets are currently &#8220;selling at a deep discount&#8221;. She further advised her followers and readers to take a decisive stance on their investments. &#8220;You need to be scooping them up, without a perfectionist mindset of being too afraid to buy if it isn&#8217;t the absolute bottom.&#8221; Related Reading: Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly Following Ripple’s Win Over SEC While Jones accentuates the potential gains of these assets, she equally emphasizes the investor mindset. Suggesting that the pursuit of the perfect buying point might be a fallacy, she stated, &#8220;You need to be scooping them up, without a perfectionist mindset of being too afraid to buy if it isn&#8217;t the absolute bottom.&#8221; Emphasizing the timely nature of the present market conditions, Jones opines, &#8220;These are life changing prices, but you must take action. The least amount of risk is when prices are low, which is NOW. Could they go lower? Yes. So what, they will likely be a LOT higher in 2 years or sooner, so what are you waiting for?&#8221; XRP Price Analysis A price analysis of the 1-day chart suggests that the XRP price is at a crucial point following the summary judgement in the Ripple vs. SEC case. Related Reading: SEC Asks Court To File Interlocutory Appeal Vs. Ripple, XRP Price Stable At press time, XRP was trading at $0.59, down more than 35% from its yearly high at $0.93 following the summary judgment in the Ripple against the US Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) case. Before the verdict was announced, XRP was trading at $0.47, meaning that the XRP price has already lost most of its gains following the euphoria over Ripple&#8217;s victory. A look at the 1-day chart shows that XRP found support at the 100-day EMA at $0.5782 yesterday. Subsequently, XRP bulls managed to stage a small recovery. However, XRP is not out of the woods yet as the correction could continue unless the price shows a signal of trend reversal on the shorter timeframes. A first step would be to break above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.6340. A strong confirmation would be a spike above $0.69 where the 50% Fibonacci retracement level is located. In a bearish scenario, XRP also loses the 100-day EMA and falls towards the 200-day EMA at $0.5256. The level can be interpreted as the most crucial support at the moment. If the &#8220;bull line&#8221; fails to hold, the XRP price could face a crash to pre-Ripple ruling levels. Featured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently witnessed a gradual decline in both its price and Open Interest over the past three days. These developments have raised concerns of a bearish sentiment in the futures market. In a trend that has been unfolding over the last three days, Dogecoin&#8217;s price has experienced a steady descent, accompanied by a decrease in Open Interest. Open Interest refers to the total number of active contracts in the futures market. Its decline is often indicative of waning enthusiasm among traders and investors, suggesting a prevailing bearish sentiment.

As of the most recent data from CoinGecko, the current DOGE price is $0.070578. In the last 24 hours alone, the meme coin suffered a 5.0% drop, while its seven-day performance showed a decline of nearly 5%. The downward trajectory intensified as the market structure of DOGE slipped below the $0.075 mark earlier in the week. The price report noted that amidst the prevailing bearish sentiment, the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator exhibited an opposing trend. Over the past week, the OBV steadily climbed, suggesting an increase in buying pressure. DOGE market cap at $9.8 billion today.

Ancient Dogecoin Whales Resurface In a surprising turn of events, the crypto community has observed the reawakening of four ancient Dogecoin whales in 2023. These whales, who had maintained a prolonged period of inactivity spanning over nine years, suddenly sprang into action. Collectively, they have transferred a staggering sum of 6,818,192 DOGE, amounting to approximately $557,157, according to data from Whale Alert. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bulls On The Horizon?

					<description><![CDATA[Another shocking discovery has rattled the crypto sector as Christian Peev, a 41-year-old US cryptocurrency investor has been found dead. Christian Peev&#8217;s Alleged Murderer Was A Friend According to Peev’s cousin, the crypto investor disappeared in early August, and growing increasingly worried, Peev’s cousin reported him missing to authorities on August 10, which prompted an investigation.  The dismembered body of the American-Bulgaria investor was found days later by plumbers called to fix a blocked drain in Sofia, Bulgaria, who eventually discovered that it was pieces of a human body that caused the blockage.  Related Reading: Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly Following Ripple’s Win Over SEC The remains were later identified to be Peev’s body, although parts of the body, like the head and bones were missing. These were found to be buried as the murderer could not flush them down the toilet. Following the discovery of the remains, a bartender, Vesco Valchinov has been named as the prime suspect in connection to the murder of Peev. Christian Peev was known to be highly recognized in top events and parties, where he met the bartender. According to sources, Vesco Valchinov and Christian Peev met at a bar about 5-6 years ago, and Peev being a formidable and knowledgeable crypto enthusiast introduced Valchinov to the world of cryptocurrency. Valchinov became the prime suspect in Peev&#8217;s demise as surveillance footage showed that both Valchinov and Peev were seen entering Valchinov&#8217;s residence on August 8, but Valchinov was the only one seen leaving his residence the following day. Forensics show that Valchinov allegedly killed Peev with a dumbbell in his residence. However, Valchinov was not the only one involved in the demise of Christian Peev.   Total market cap sitting at $1.121 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Konstantin Subotinov who was believed to be an accomplice to Valchinov was also arrested by authorities and later confessed that he helped Valchinov in disposing of the remains of Peev&#8217;s body by driving some of the parts to Vitosha to bury them. Valchinov apparently knew the authorities were onto him and he tried to lose his tail by fleeing to a hotel in Vitosha. But unfortunately for him, authorities tracked his phone and he was apprehended the following day. Could The Murder Be Money Related? Although the authorities and investigators believe that the murder of Christian Peev is money related, as Peev had amassed a considerable fortune from his crypto investments, jealousy has also been seen as a potential motivation for the murder of Peev. Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens Investigators speculate that Valchinov might have been jealous of his friend Peev and the fortune he has built for himself. However, the investigation is still ongoing, and more details will be unveiled, as authorities tend to crack the case and figure out what led to this tragedy. Peev’s death marks the second crypto investor found murdered and dismembered in less than a month. In July, crypto influencer Fernando Pérez Algaba was found dead in Buenos Aires, Argentina. According to authorities, Algaba’s remains were found in a suitcase and his death is believed to be connected to a significant debt he owed.  Featured image from How Stuff Works, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The world&#8217;s largest exchange Binance announced on Tuesday, August 15, intentions to delist three tokens from its trading platform. According to the exchange&#8217;s official statement, it regularly conducts a periodic review of all cryptocurrencies and trading products on its platform, ensuring they are of the highest standards in order to protect its customers’ interests. This review is based on certain factors, including trading volume and liquidity, network stability, network security against attacks, and the project’s team commitment, among others.  Based on the results of their latest reviews, Binance states the following tokens are lacking in compliance in relation to these factors: Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII). Therefore, the exchange will be delisting all trading pairs related to these tokens at exactly 03:00 (UTC) on August 22, 2023. In addition, the order extends to other platforms affiliated with the exchange, including Binance Simple Earn, Binance Loans, Binance Gift Card, and Binance Pay. Albeit, the enforcement date varies for some of these platforms.  Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? Binance Delisting Leads To Heavy Losses For Tokens Following Binance’s announcement, Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII) have all seen their value plunged into double-digit losses. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SNM token is the largest loser of the trio declining by 79.09% in the last 24 hours.  Meanwhile, SRM and YFII are down by 29.19% and 19.55%, respectively, over the last day. These losses are quite unsurprising, as delisting by any exchange is commonly interpreted by investors as a disapproval of the token. Considering Binance’s status as a key player in the global crypto space boasting over 150 million users, the exchange delisting a token can be quite detrimental, as seen above. At the time of writing, SNM is trading at $0.05924, while SRM and YFII are exchanging hands at $0.5053 and $584.63, respectively.  SNM trading at $0.0597 on the daily chart &#124; Source: SNM/USDT chart on Tradingview.com Binance Connect Shuts Down In other news, Binance has decided to close down its regulated buy and sell service, Binance Connect, due to the deactivation of supporting card payments on the platform by its provider.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world&#8217;s largest exchange Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-delist-snm-srm-and-yfii-on-2023-08-22-f43511a4c1d347a8a2dd1efbdd2fe716" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> on Tuesday, August 15, intentions to delist three tokens from its trading platform. According to the exchange&#8217;s official statement, it regularly conducts a periodic review of all cryptocurrencies and trading products on its platform, ensuring they are of the highest standards in order to protect its customers’ interests.</p>
<p>This review is based on certain factors, including trading volume and liquidity, network stability, network security against attacks, and the project’s team commitment, among others. </p>
<p>Based on the results of their latest reviews, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/binance/binance-zero-fee-bitcoin-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Binance</a> states the following tokens are lacking in compliance in relation to these factors: Sonm (SNM), <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/serum-srm-price-looks-set-after-hibernation-can-price-go-to-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Serum (SRM)</a>, and DFI.Money (YFII). Therefore, the exchange will be delisting all trading pairs related to these tokens at exactly 03:00 (UTC) on August 22, 2023.</p>
<p>In addition, the order extends to other platforms affiliated with the exchange, including Binance Simple Earn, Binance Loans, Binance Gift Card, and Binance Pay. Albeit, the enforcement date varies for some of these platforms. </p>

<h2>Binance Delisting Leads To Heavy Losses For Tokens</h2>
<p>Following Binance’s announcement, Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII) have all seen their value plunged into double-digit losses. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SNM token is the largest loser of the trio declining by 79.09% in the last 24 hours. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, SRM and YFII are down by 29.19% and 19.55%, respectively, over the last day. These losses are quite unsurprising, as delisting by any exchange is commonly interpreted by investors as a disapproval of the token.</p>
<p>Considering Binance’s status as a key player in the global crypto space<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/binance/binance-celebrates-significant-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener "> boasting over 150 million users</a>, the exchange delisting a token can be quite detrimental, as seen above. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SNM is trading at $0.05924, while SRM and YFII are exchanging hands at $0.5053 and $584.63, respectively. </p>

<h2>Binance Connect Shuts Down</h2>
<p>In other news, Binance has decided to close down its regulated buy and sell service, Binance Connect, due to the deactivation of supporting card payments on the platform by its provider.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto space is on the verge of another potentially historic moment with the first Ethereum Futures ETF in the US. Volatility Shares, a pioneer in the ETF space, has announced its intention to launch the Ether Strategy ETF (Ticker: ETHU) on October 12, 2023. If all goes as planned, this could mark the first Ether based exchange traded fund (ETF) in the United States. First Ethereum Futures ETF Is Set To Launch In The US Volatility Shares has positioned the ETF around cash-settled Ethereum futures contracts trading on the CBOE. Notably, the ETF avoids direct investment in Ether itself. &#8220;The Fund is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing its assets principally in cash-settled contracts referencing Ether&#8230; The Fund does not invest directly in Ether,&#8221; reads the SEC filing.

While Volatility Shares leads the pack, they&#8217;re not alone in this pursuit. A total of 13 heavyweight financial institutions, including names like Bitwise, VanEck, Vakyrie, Roubhill, ProShares, and Grayscale, have sought the US SEC&#8217;s blessings for their Ether Futures ETFs. However, as of now, the SEC hasn&#8217;t given its green signal to any. Will Ether Echo BTC&#8217;s 2021 Surge? Remarkably, the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was launched back on October 19, 2021. At that time, ProShares won the race for the first mover effect. And this has paid off. The total assets in Bitcoin futures ETFs accounts to $1.3 billion. Of that, nearly $1.1 billion is in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). The second largest ETF is the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF with $73 million. No other ETF has more than $50 million in assets under management.

In the run-up to the futures ETF launch, BTC put on a 60% rally from Oct. 1 to Oct. 19, rising 60% to $66,970. In the next seven subsequent days, BTC saw a correction of about 14% before Bitcoin continued its rally to the all-time high near $69,000.

While BTC was in a full blown bull market, the crypto market is currently in a phase of stagnation, possibly before the start of a new bull market.

					<description><![CDATA[The price action of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has encountered a significant compression, primarily attributed to substantial selling originating from a prominent institutional market participant. Data obtained from Lookonchain, a renowned on-chain analytics resource, has shed light on the ongoing selling spree by Voyager, a troubled asset manager currently navigating bankruptcy proceedings.  This selling binge over the past four days has amounted to an astonishing 1.4 trillion SHIB tokens, equivalent to approximately $14.4 million. The cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed a noteworthy development as Voyager, amidst its financial restructuring, embarked on an extensive liquidation of SHIB tokens.  Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Empowers Smart Contracts With Upgrades – Positive Impact On Price?

Amid speculation, it&#8217;s important to note that the asset manager has now depleted its SHIB holdings, as confirmed by Lookonchain&#8217;s report. This intriguing turn of events prompts speculation about the potential impact on SHIB&#8217;s trajectory. Voyager has been selling assets on #Coinbase for the past 4 days and has sold 49 tokens for ~$63M.

Notably, SHIB has demonstrated a commendable performance over the last seven days, exhibiting a robust 5.9% rally now trading at $0.00000998 via CoinGecko. While the cryptocurrency faced a 2.4% slump in the past 24 hours, this transient dip may be attributed to broader market sentiments influenced by seemingly unrelated news. SHIB market cap currently at $5.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com News circulating about potential downgrades within the banking sector might have inadvertently contributed to the 24-hour slump witnessed by SHIB. It&#8217;s worth acknowledging that seemingly unrelated developments can trigger ripples of uncertainty across financial markets, ultimately impacting various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies like SHIB. Such negative sentiments, although momentary, have the potential to trigger short-term pullbacks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs.

As SHIB hovers around its current value of $0.00000998, investors and enthusiasts are cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a sustained price rally. Despite the recent slump, SHIB&#8217;s overall trajectory remains promising, supported by both its recent rally and the depletion of Voyager&#8217;s SHIB holdings.
