			            <description><![CDATA[Congressmen Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis are some of the people that scolded the SEC for its actions on the crypto scene. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its Chairman, Gary Gensler, have received a significant wave of criticism from numerous organizations and individuals (including some American politicians) for the way they have treated the cryptocurrency industry over the years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ripple&#8217;s recent court victory against the Commission prompted even more lawmakers to castigate the regulator. In the next lines, we will name some of the most vocal opponents of the SEC and their reasons.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Lengthy List of Politicians</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">United States Representative Warren Davidson was among the first to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/rep-davidson-declares-war-on-sec-boss-gary-gensler-over-long-series-of-abuses/" data-wpel-link="internal">display</a> his dissatisfaction with Gary Gensler&#8217;s anti-crypto campaign this year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawmaker raised his concerns after the SEC announced new rules that could &#8220;modernize&#8221; the concept of an &#8220;exchange&#8221; so it could be more closely referred to as a system that &#8220;brings together buyers and sellers of securities that offer the use of non-firm trading interest and provide another type of non-discretionary method.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Davidson </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">claimed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> this proposal is another example of the agency&#8217;s &#8220;long series of abuses&#8221; toward the cryptocurrency sector. He went further, introducing legislation that could remove the current Chair of the SEC from his post.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apart from applying enhanced supervision on digital asset exchanges, the watchdog </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> lawsuits against two of the behemoths in the industry &#8211; Binance and Coinbase. It insisted they had violated certain rules and offered trading services with alleged unregistered securities, such as BNB, BUSD, ADA, SOL, MATIC, and more.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Senator Cynthia Lummis (a keen proponent of bitcoin and even a HODLer) was quick to react to that move. She </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1666181240167317507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">believes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the SEC had failed to provide &#8220;a path&#8221; for crypto marketplaces and did not offer &#8220;adequate legal guidance on what differentiates a security from a commodity.&#8221; She also scolded the agency for the lack of comprehensive crypto rules in the USA, which could push the industry offshore or &#8220;into the shadows.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC was involved in the cryptocurrency space again in mid-June when multiple finance giants, including BlackRock, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> with it to release a spot BTC ETF in the States. The Commission was initially unsupportive of the idea of such monetary products, calling the applications &#8220;inadequate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">US Congressman Patrick McHenry </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1674876179344392195" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">opposed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the SEC&#8217;s vision, maintaining that the only reason Gensler would be against spot BTC ETFs is &#8220;if he wants to kill crypto&#8221; in America. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Effect of Ripple&#8217;s Victory</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One groundbreaking event for the entire cryptocurrency field was Ripple&#8217;s recent court win against the SEC. A US judge </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-16-as-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ripple-in-sec-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ruled</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in favor of the enterprise blockchain provider in mid-July, stating that most XRP sales do not constitute securities transactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulator filed its lawsuit against Ripple more than three years ago, alleging the entity&#8217;s native token should be treated as a security, similar to bonds or stocks, and therefore it should become subject to SEC regulation. Interestingly, Gensler has claimed over the past few years that the only digital currency with the status of a commodity is bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Representative Ritchie Torres wrote a letter a few days after Ripple&#8217;s landmark victory, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/18/nys-torres-asks-if-sec-will-ease-up-on-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">claiming</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the SEC (under the rule of Chair Gensler) has failed to issue &#8220;a single rule on crypto assets, nor has it given any clear guidance.&#8221; He also asked whether the watchdog will end its war on the industry following its court loss.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Senator Lummis was once again vocal on the topic, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1683845466306252801" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">opining</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC legal battle has &#8220;reinforced the need for Congress to create a regulatory structure for crypto assets.&#8221; She pointed out the bill, introduced by her and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, which aims to categorize most digital currencies as commodities (or in the same bracket as gold, silver, oil, and natural gas).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last but not least, US Representative Dusty Johnson </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/4117714-the-ripple-effect-a-new-wave-in-digital-asset-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">argued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in a recent statement that Gensler&#8217;s &#8220;consistent efforts to project an air of certainty&#8221; in the crypto sector and outline that almost every digital asset is a security were put to the test by the result of the case against Ripple. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawmaker believes the court ruling was a double-edged sword since it damaged Gensler&#8217;s approach to the industry and created even bigger confusion. He concluded that the only solution to that problem is the implementation of crypto legislation coming from Congress. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all the rage owing to the success of OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT, which has taken conversations about the space to a whole new level. Off late, several AI-related crypto tokens have sprung up, capturing the imagination of investors amidst a dull market.</p>
<p>After initial gains, however, these assets underwent significant value reductions. Prominent blockchain analytical firm Kaiko also echoed a similar sentiment.</p>

<li>But over the last month, the token lost over 9% and was currently trading at $0.214. Its weekly loss was found to be a little over 5%.</li>
<li>Injective (INJ) token was down by more than 13% over the past week as it exchanged hands at $8.13.</li>

<li>SingularityNet, the open and decentralized platform of AI services, declined by 5% over the past seven days, which dragged its value to $0.22 at the time of writing.</li>
<li>Render&#8217;s (RNDR) weekly declines were also along similar lines. The AI-related token fell to $1.78 following an over 5% drop.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Aside from SHIB, the other top gainers on a daily scale include QNT and MKR.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price performance continues to be quite underwhelming, but the asset managed to sustain above $29,000 at least.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also slightly in the green, with gains of up to 2% from the likes of DOGE and SOL. SHIB has jumped the most from the top 20.</p>
<h2>BTC Stalls Above $29K</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that there have been more exciting times in the crypto ecosystem when it comes down to price performances. Bitcoin started the week with a nosedive that drove it from over $30,000 to a monthly low of just under $29,000.</p>
<p>The bulls intervened at this point and pushed the asset to just above that line. The next several days saw little-to-no movements, and even the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/federal-reserve-raises-rates-again-by-0-25-bitcoin-trades-flat/" data-wpel-link="internal">US Fed&#8217;s interest rate hike</a> on Wednesday failed to deliver enhanced volatility as they did in the past.</p>
<p>Aside from a few hundred dollar<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-loses-30k-as-us-federal-reserve-hikes-interest-rates-by-another-25bps-this-weeks-crypto-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal"> pumps and dumps</a>, BTC spent the whole business week in a tight range between $29,000 and $29,500. Its market capitalization has remained below $570 billion, but its dominance over the altcoins has taken another slight hit and is down to 48.1% on CMC.</p>

<h2>SHIB Pumps 5%</h2>
<p>Although more volatile by nature, the alternative coins have also failed to produce any major moves in either direction in the past several days. The charts since yesterday, though, seem a bit more positive, with minor gains.</p>
<p>Ethereum and XRP have added less than 0.5% on a daily scale and trade above $1,870 and $0.7, respectively. Dogecoin and Solana have jumped by just over 1% to $0.078 and $25. Tron, MATIC, and Polkadot are also slightly in the green, while BNB, ADA, and LTC have charted insignificant losses.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu has increased the most from the larger-cap alts following the release of the Shibarium beta version. Quant follows suit from the top 36, with a 7.5% daily surge.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Supporters of war-torn Ukraine have reportedly donated over $225 million worth of crypto to the country in its fight against Russia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prominent companies and figures part of the digital asset industry, such as the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance and Tron&#8217;s founder Justin Sun, have also contributed to the nation&#8217;s efforts.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Strong Start Followed by Stagnation</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a Crystal Blockchain report (<a href="https://fakti.bg/life/803023-taksuvaha-klient-na-restorant-vav-varna-za-tova-che-ne-iska-sos-na-picata-si?utm_source=mobilebg&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=firstpage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">seen</a> by </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CoinDesk</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">), Ukraine has received almost a quarter of a billion dollars in crypto assets as donations since the start of the military conflict with Russia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities have used the funds to purchase ammunition, medical equipment, weapons, and other war supplies to continue resisting the Russian invasion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that the largest chunk of the total contributions came in 2022, as they stagnated at the end of last year and the beginning of 2023. The country has received less than $10 million worth of crypto since May.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">March 2022 was the most successful month in terms of donations when Ukraine racked up almost $100 million. February 2022 (when Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin launched the &#8220;special military operation&#8221;) ranked second with over $30 million in digital assets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crystal Blockchain estimated that the most contributions ($83 million) came in the form of USDT. Ethereum (ETH) donations were second, comprising $79 million of the amount, whereas Bitcoin (BTC) ranked third ($41 million).<br />

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Munter – principal advisor to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on accounting and auditing matters – issued a warning on Thursday to crypto accounting firms whose work is inappropriately marketed as a substitute for “audits.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-crypto-072723#_ftnref3" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a>, titled “The Potential Pitfalls of Purported Crypto “Assurance” Work”, claimed that clients of such firms often promote their work as being at “parity” with a financial statement audit.</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>“Such suggestions are false,” he asserted. “Non-audit arrangements are neither as rigorous nor as comprehensive as a financial statement audit, and may not provide any reasonable assurance to investors.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>The advisor referenced a March <a href="https://pcaobus.org/resources/information-for-investors/investor-advisories/investor-advisory-exercise-caution-with-third-party-verification-proof-of-reserve-reports" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which warned investors of accounting firms providing Proof of Reserves (PoR) reports for crypto exchanges.</li>
<li>PoR is a blockchain-based accounting method that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/okx-releases-industry-leading-9th-consecutive-proof-of-reserves-in-july-showing-11-3-billion-in-primary-assets/" data-wpel-link="internal">some exchanges</a> have used to verify the number of crypto assets they have on hand. The PCAOB warned that such reports “are not audits,” as they do not account for a crypto firm’s liabilities, among other factors.</li>
<li>Munter’s statement added that accountants servicing crypto firms that mislead investors about the nature of the former’s work could be found liable under securities laws.</li>
<li>If accounting firms find that their clients make misleading statements, the Office of the Chief Accountant (OCA) recommended a “noisy withdrawal, disassociating itself from the client, including by way of its own public statements.”</li>
<li>A similar withdrawal <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-and-crypto-com-auditor-mazars-group-pauzes-work-with-crypto-clients/" data-wpel-link="internal">occurred</a> with Mazars Group in December 2022, when the firm distanced itself from all crypto firms shortly after releasing a PoR report on Binance.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The President of the Kyrgyz Republic &#8211; Sadyr Japarov &#8211; has reportedly approved the building of a cryptocurrency mining farm at a hydropower plant near the country&#8217;s biggest river &#8211; the Naryn.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The political leader believes this development will allow the hydroelectric station to use its excessive energy since it can not sell it anywhere.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Permission Granted </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a local media outlet, President Japarov has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="http://kg.kabar.kg/news/prezident-sadyr-zhaparov-maining-boiuncha-zhoop-berdi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">allowed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the construction of a crypto mining farm at the Kambar-Ata-2 Hydro Power Plant. The investment will cost approximately $20 million and could be one way to avoid energy losses since there are periods when the station produces more electricity than necessary. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The plant was launched in 2010 and develops 120 MW of energy each year. However, it could employ only 90 MW of this quantity, meaning the remaining 30 MW &#8220;has been absorbed into the air.&#8221; In financial terms, it lost over $37 million due to that flaw. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We have enough electricity on summer days. It even exceeds. We cannot sell anywhere. Therefore, in order to benefit the energy system, we are allowing sites that can carry the load,&#8221; Japarov explained.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He outlined that the crypto mining facility could temporarily shut operations during winter when the power plant&#8217;s productivity is not that high. The construction of the mine should happen in the next nine months.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, Japarov stated that the government has intentions to build more hydroelectric power plants and start exporting energy to its neighbors:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Starting from next year, there is a task to export electricity to Pakistan and Afghanistan through the CASA 1000 line. We have already made a commitment to the World Bank. Therefore, we are increasing the pace of construction of hydroelectric power stations.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[The SEC shouldn’t approve any Bitcoin spot ETF partnered with Coinbase without approving Grayscale and other applicants at the same time, the company says.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale wrote a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday calling for the agency to simultaneously approve any qualifying Bitcoin spot ETF applications, so as to not &#8220;pick winners and losers.”</p>
<p>However, the firm also argued that Coinbase shouldn’t qualify as a surveillance partner to launch such a product, under the SEC’s pre-established rules.</p>
<h2>Why Coinbase Isn’t Good Enough</h2>
<p>Per the <a href="https://grayscale.com/grayscales-latest-gbtc-comment-letter/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">comment letter</a>, the SEC has already questioned the pricing data produced by ‘unregulated’ Bitcoin trading venues for years.</p>
<p>Grayscale referenced the SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83913.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">explicit denial</a> of the GraniteShares ETP Trust in 2018, which intended to form a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA)with Gemini’s exchange. The SEC determined that Gemini did not represent a regulated market comparable to a national securities exchange.</p>
<p>The firm also pointed out the SEC’s rejection of Grayscale’s ETF application last year showed that the SEC wouldn’t give weight to market data sourced from a group of spot Bitcoin exchanges, including Coinbase. Oversight from both NYSDFS and FinCEN, alongside BitLicense regulation, was deemed irrelevant to whether the SEC would consider the group sufficient for an SSA.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We believe the Commission’s prior decisions have already determined that such an agreement with a venue lacking compulsory investigative authority and oversight by a comprehensive market, regulator does not satisfy Section 6(b)(5) in the absence of a surveillance sharing agreement with a market of significant size,” wrote Grayscale.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grayscale clarified that it was not “disputing the usefulness of information obtainable under a surveillance-sharing agreement with a spot bitcoin trading venue.”</p>
<h2>Grayscale’s Court Battle</h2>
<p>Starting in late June, multiple asset managers – including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-starts-reviewing-several-spot-bitcoin-etf-including-blackrocks-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock</a> – filed with the SEC to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. Many of those firms later named Coinbase as their ideal partner for an SSA to protect against market manipulation, an element of each filing that no applicant has managed to get right by the SEC thus far.</p>
<p>Unlike its friendlier competitors, Grayscale is attempting to convert its Bitcoin fund into an ETF by directly challenging the SEC in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-has-70-odds-of-winning-sec-lawsuit-bloomberg-analyst/" data-wpel-link="internal">court</a>. The company stands by its thesis that CME Bitcoin Futures represent a market of sufficient size related to the Bitcoin spot market, sufficient for an SSA.</p>
<p>Should the SEC change its mind and approve a Coinbase-partnered ETF, Grayscale said that the agency should at least prioritize investors first – specifically those of its GBTC fund.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Commission would be required to afford the listing exchange for the Trust (and all other spot bitcoin ETPs whose Rule 19b-4 filings were previously disapproved) the opportunity to amend their Rule 19b-4 filings, so that all of these spot bitcoin ETP proposals can be approved simultaneously,” the company stated.</p></blockquote>
