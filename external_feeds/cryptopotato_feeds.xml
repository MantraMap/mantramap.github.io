			            <description><![CDATA[Bristling with confidence after its big win, the fintech firm is branching out with an investment in a tech startup that plans to marry the metaverse with AI.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 18, Ripple announced it had invested in AI and metaverse technology and content company, Futureverse. The move has given a second wind to XRP prices which are outperforming the top 20 crypto assets at the moment.</p>
<p>The company has raised $54 million in a Series A round of funding in an effort to marry AI and the metaverse. The funding round was led by 10T Holdings and included participation from Ripple.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We are excited to support the <a href="https://twitter.com/futureverse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@futureverse</a> vision!<br />

<p>— Ripple (@Ripple) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ripple/status/1681354053136138272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Ripple Into The Metaverse</h2>
<p>Futureverse offers AI content generation tools designed to enhance the music, objects, characters, and animations for metaverse platforms.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/futureverse-raises-54-million-series-a-to-scale-metaverse-infrastructure-and-introduce-ai-to-the-metaverse-301879447.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">announcement</a>, Futureverse will use the proceeds from the funding round to continue developing comprehensive AI technologies.</p>
<p>These include a “blockchain and suite of protocols with ready-made runtimes for building next-generation metaverse apps, games, and experiences.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Futureverse is already a technology partner with Ripple. Its “Root Network” blockchain is integrated with XRPL and supports the use of XRP as a GAS token as well as the XLS-20 NFT standard.</p>
<p>The investment move by Ripple follows a partial but <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stuttering-sec-chair-gary-gensler-disappointed-at-ripple-victory/" data-wpel-link="internal">key victory</a> in its three-year battle against the SEC. Venturebeat commented that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“That ruling will likely liberate crypto companies and blockchain game companies from regulations that have hampered revenue.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Co-Founders of Futureverse, Aaron McDonald and Shara Senderoff, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“With the help of our tremendous partners 10T and Ripple, we are excited to take the metaverse from an abstract idea to a tangible, accessible, and interactive destination.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the past year, the firm has formed global strategic partnerships with renowned organizations and personalities, including FIFA, Mastercard, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/snoop-dogg-crypto-casino-roobet-chief-ganjaroo-officer/" data-wpel-link="internal">Snoop Dogg</a>, and Keanu Reeves.</p>
<h2>Metaverse Tokens Battered But XRP Up</h2>
<p>Anything metaverse related has taken a hit in 2023 as AI takes the spotlight and the hype. As a result, metaverse-related tokens have been hammered hard in the second quarter.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://twitter.com/coingecko/status/1681242900540321793" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> from CoinGecko detailed the extent of these losses. The top five metaverse and play-to-earn tokens by market cap, including Axie Infinity (AXS), Sandbox (SAND), and Decentraland (MANA), saw losses of up to 40% for the period.</p>
<p>Many of these metaverse tokens remain down 80-90% from their peaks despite a 45% increase in crypto market capitalization this year.</p>
<p>Ripple’s XRP had jumped as much as 10% on the day following the news as it topped out at $0.817 during Asian trading before pulling back slightly.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Turkish prosecutors have initially sought a jail sentence of up to five years on charges of "smuggling" under the Tax Procedure Law.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Faruk Fetih Özer &#8211; founder of the once-leading Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex &#8211; will spend seven months and 15 days in jail for failing to submit necessary documents to the Tax Inspection Board. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also faces fraud charges about pocketing more than $2 billion in clients&#8217; funds when the platform collapsed in 2021. While Özer supposedly escaped Turkey shortly after the event, he was arrested in Albania last summer. If found guilty on all counts, his punishment could be much more severe.</span></p>

They later reduced the punishment based on his behavior, social relations, and potential impact on his future. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, the court postponed the announcement of the verdict against Özer and put off the order&#8217;s implementation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thodex&#8217;s founder once again claimed he was innocent, explaining he was not the company&#8217;s leader at the time of the alleged crime. He added that a previously appointed trustee had prevented him from showing the requested records. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The legal process against Özer started in October 2021 when the Turkish authorities urged him to present certain documents related to his activities in Thodex. The exchange&#8217;s founder failed to do so within the specified legal timeframe. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His Other Problems</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Besides the aforementioned offense, Özer faces several other accusations that could send him to prison for the rest of his life. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Failed investors and prosecutors have insisted that he had a main role in Thodex&#8217;s collapse in the spring of 2021 when the platform ceased trading services.

			            <description><![CDATA[Cathie Wood has grown even more bullish on Bitcoin as an insurance policy since the U.S. regional banking crisis in March.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said on Tuesday that she and her fund are now more confident in their “bull case” for Bitcoin (BTC): $1.5 million by 2030.</p>
<p>The investment manager’s boost of confidence stems from Bitcoin’s positive response to the United States regional banking crisis in March.</p>
<h2>The Bear, Base, and Bull Case</h2>
<p>Ark published a bear, base, and bull <a href="https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Big_Ideas/ARK%20Invest_013123_Presentation_Big%20Ideas%202023_Final.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">thesis</a> for where Bitcoin would be in 2030 back in January. All price targets were many multiple higher than Bitcoin’s price today, sitting at $258,500, $682,800, and $1.48 million respectively.</p>
<p>Each case put forward different estimates for the total market share of various financial use cases that Bitcoin could gobble up. The bull case rested largely on Bitcoin absorbing $50% of gold’s market cap, while also claiming 6.5% of the institutional asset base and 10% of the M2 money supply in emerging markets.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1681044467904655362" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">interview</a> with Bloomberg on Monday, Wood said that ARK’s confidence in the bull case had “increased” in March when regional banks including Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) all collapsed after facing overwhelming withdrawal pressure.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ARKK&#39;s Cathie Wood: on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#bitcoin</a> &quot;is an insurance policy against two things: the confiscation of wealth, either directly or by inflation, or in the deflation world, what is it a hedge against? It&#39;s a hedge against counterparty risk. We won&#39;t have an &#39;08-&#39;09 with bitcoin&quot; <a href="https://t.co/jk9hR0Lsid" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/jk9hR0Lsid</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Pledditor (@Pledditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1681044467904655362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“As regional banks are going bankrupt and the stocks are imploding across the board, Bitcoin rallied from $19,000 to $30,000,” Wood said. In Wood’s view, this rally signaled a “flight to safety” among investors that “everyone” will eventually want.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin As Insurance</h2>
<p>For one, Wood said that Bitcoin insures against both direct and indirect confiscation of wealth. Whereas direct confiscation means stealing one’s assets by force, indirect confiscation is inflation – the devaluation of a national currency, particularly one whose supply has been astronomically inflated through money printing.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s supply is programmatically capped at 21 million units, making inflation of this style impossible. Yet even in a deflationary environment for fiat, Wood said Bitcoin presents a hedge against counterparty risk.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We won’t have an 08’ / 09’ with Bitcoin,” she said. “Everything is decentralized, and transparent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Wood isn’t the only billionaire with a hyper-bullish long-term thesis for Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, has predicted that Bitcoin’s market cap could soar to $100 million – implying a BTC price of $4.7 million per coin.</p>
<p>Other bulls are confident that Bitcoin will perform strongly over the next 18 months. This year, both Rich Dad Poor Dad author <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-will-explode-to-120k-in-2024-the-us-dollar-will-die-rober-kiyosaki/" data-wpel-link="internal">Robert Kiyosaki</a> and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/banking-giant-standard-chartered-sees-bitcoin-tapping-50k-in-2023-and-120k-in-2024-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">Standard Chartered Bank</a> have called for a $120,000 per coin price by 2025.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The milestone has made Struct Finance the fastest-growing Avalanche-based DeFi platform in the past week.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Struct Finance recorded over 129% gains in its total value locked (TVL) over the past week, according to data from DeFi TVL aggregator DeFiLlama.</p>
<p>Struct Finance’s TVL more than <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/struct-finance" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">doubled</a> between July 11 and July 18 from $350,820 to $800,000, and at the time of writing, the TVL was at $806,314. When measured in Avalanche’s native token AVAX, the TVL has soared from 25,800 AVAX to 57,553 AVAX.</p>
<h2>Struct Finance Gains Over 100% in TVL</h2>
<p>In the past week, Struct’s growth earned it the number-one spot as the fastest-growing DeFi platform on Avalanche in less than a month of its mainnet launch. The protocol currently ranks first for both one-day and seven-day TVL gain on the network.</p>
<p>Struct now <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Avalanche" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">ranks</a> as the 34th largest Avalanche-based platform by TVL. While the protocol’s growth is significant, it still trails far behind Benqi and Aave, the first and second largest Avalanche-based platforms, with TVLs of $232 million and $214 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Struct Finance, which launched its mainnet on June 21, 2023, offers investors customizable structured financial products that give exposure to digital assets. During the mainnet launch announcement, the platform unveiled a tranching mechanism and innovative Interest Rate Vaults that enable users to invest in products according to risk tolerance and earn predictable returns.</p>
<h2>Struct Bags $3.9 Million in Funding</h2>
<p>As <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/defi-platform-struct-finance-introduces-new-interest-rate-products/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a>, the Avalanche-based DeFi platform allows clients to split the risk of any yield-bearing asset into different parts so it can fit into all strategies. Investors can choose between a fixed but lower return and a higher-risk variable return on their investments.</p>
<p>The returns from the underlying assets are first distributed to the fixed tranche while the remainder is moved to the variable tranche, giving them additional exposure to the initially-picked investment.</p>
<p>In addition, Struct’s unique features allow liquidity providers to earn fixed yields during stable market conditions, regardless of market fluctuations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the project <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/avalanche-based-defi-platform-struct-finance-raises-3-9m-in-seed-funding/" data-wpel-link="internal">bagged</a> $3.9 million in March 2022 during a funding round led by Avalanche ecosystem’s Blizzard Fund, Bison Fund, Bixin Ventures, Double Peak, FBG Capital, and AVentures Dao, among others.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange &#8211; Binance &#8211; ended its partnership with the Argentine Football Association (AFA), claiming the latter has not &#8220;fully met its contractual obligations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The agreement, which turned the platform into the Global Main Sponsor of Argentina&#8217;s national soccer team, was supposed to last until 2027.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Parting Ways</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance and the AFA </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-becomes-the-new-global-sponsor-of-argentinas-national-soccer-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">signed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the deal in January 2022, several months before the start of the World Cup in Qatar, which saw Argentina lifting the trophy.

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Binance has decided to end its association with the AFA (Argentine Football Association). We regularly evaluate the results of our partnerships around the world, and unfortunately, despite being offered time and opportunity, AFA has not fully met its contractual obligations, which goes against our business values ​​and our association principles,&#8221; the announcement reads.</span></p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius, its creditors, and its Series B holders have reached a settlement with regard to the distribution of $25 million in proceeds from the sale of crypto custodian GK8.</p>
<p>According to the filing, the settlements seek to deploy $24 million for legal expenses while allocating the rest of $1 million among the Series B holders. The court document also states that the settlement agreement was born out of the &#8220;mutual desire&#8221; to prevent costly legal disputes and an extensive confirmation process, which would lead to higher professional fees.</p>
<ul>
<li>The agreement between the Debtors, the Committee, and the Initial Consenting Series B Preferred Holders is said to have been &#8220;thoughtfully negotiated and is eminently reasonable.&#8221;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174907182380000000004.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">filing</a> read,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Settlement brings an end to nearly a year of highly contentious litigation and removes one of the largest obstacles to confirmation and emergence in exchange for a $25 million cash settlement from the proceeds of the GK8 sale and a mutual release of claims between the Initial Consenting Series B Preferred Holders and the Estate Parties.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GK8 was initially acquired by Celsius for an unknown amount, which was later disputed to be $115 million, in November 2021.</li>
<li>However, as Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last summer following the collapse of Terra&#8217;s ecosystem, Mike Novogratz-led Galaxy Digital agreed to purchase the Israel-based company as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</li>
<li>The former Celsius CEO, Alex Mashinsky, was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ex-celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-arrested-sec-files-against-celsius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">arrested</a> last week and charged with wire fraud and other crimes.</li>
<li>US prosecutors also alleged that the exec pumped up the price of his company&#8217;s cryptocurrency to lure customers to the platform.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[How will the market actually react to a Bitcoin spot ETF – even if it gets approved?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest influx of Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETF applications in the United States is certainly generating hype, but some analysts are split on whether that excitement is warranted.</p>
<p>While many claim approval will invite a new wave of investor capital into the asset, others think it may only amount to a sell-the-news event.</p>
<h2>The Bearish Case for a Bitcoin Spot ETF</h2>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-etf-hype-threatens-another-sell-the-news-fizzle-1.1947277" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, FLX Networks Managing Director Jillian DelSignore questioned whether a Bitcoin spot ETF will attract significant capital beyond the first few days from its launch.</p>
<p>She cited the ProShare Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) as an example – a Bitcoin Futures ETF which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/first-bitcoin-futures-etf-generates-1-billion-in-trade-volume-on-first-day/" data-wpel-link="internal">listed</a> on the NYSE in October 2021. While Bitcoin spot ETF backs its shares with actual BTC, a futures ETF is backed by Bitcoin futures contracts.</p>
<p>BITO had the second-largest opening day in BITO history, attracting over $1 billion, but mostly stopped absorbing capital after a few days.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll definitely see multiple billions of dollars come in,” said DelSignoreregarding a potential spot ETF. “I do think it will be a very early momentum-driven asset growth, and then the question mark for me is what happens from there. Does it quiet down?”</p>
<p>JP Morgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou happens to agree. In a memo this month, the strategist <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-07/jpmorgan-says-a-bitcoin-etf-wouldn-t-be-an-industry-game-changer?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a> that spot ETFs have already existed in Canada and Europe for years, and have failed to attract much capital, “failing to benefit from investor outflows from gold ETFs.”</p>
<p>While conceding that there may be some benefits to having a spot ETF, the strategist predicted that they would be “rather marginal.”</p>
<h2>The Positives of a Spot ETF</h2>
<p>Contrarily, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts including Athanasios Psarofagis and James Seyffart see great potential for a spot ETF.</p>
<p>When looking at Canada’s existing crypto ETFs, analysts note that they’ve attracted 1% of the ETF market in the country already. If a roughly similar share of the United States’s ETF capital rushed into a U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF, that would amount to $54 billion.</p>
<p>For context, the total US commodity ETF market amounts to $137 billion. Furthermore, Glassnode analysts say that roughly $13.5 billion worth of BTC actively participates in price discovery right now.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nate Geraci – president of the advisory firm “The ETF Store” – thinks a spot ETF provides meaningful benefit to investors above a futures ETF, noting that the latter doesn’t perfectly track BTC’s price. While BITO is down 63% since launch, BTC has dropped just 53% since that time.</p>
<p>“Investors want the real deal,” he said. “They don’t want to hassle with potentially significant tracking error.”</p>
<p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – the world’s largest Bitcoin fund holding over 650,000 BTC under management – also faces a tracking error issue. Its share price currently trades 26% below the value of its underlying BTC, due to an inability to redeem shares easily for coins the way an ETF can do.</p>
<p>The fund is embroiled in a legal battle with regulators to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-calls-out-sec-for-approving-leveraged-bitcoin-futures-etf-while-denying-spot/" data-wpel-link="internal">transition</a> into a spot ETF, in which case its share price will immediately restore to parity with its BTC.</p>
<p>BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF race last month was alone able to boost Bitcoin’s price over the past few weeks, raising optimism that a spot ETF might finally be approved. The firm’s CEO Larry Fink, who was once a Bitcoin skeptic, said last week that Bitcoin may have the power to “transcend any one currency.”</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jeremy Allaire &#8211; Chief Executive Officer of Circle &#8211; believes American regulators should open arms to the cryptocurrency industry to prevent falling behind other nations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He said the US government was among the first to propose recommendations regarding stablecoin regulation, adding that the White House, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury Department are all focused on that mission. </span></p>

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The US may be late to the party in terms of getting these policies done, but it is the biggest economy and has the biggest technology industry and the biggest financial system in the world.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He also gave his two cents on the numerous financial giants that have recently filed to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs in the States, such as the world&#8217;s largest asset manager <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">BlackRock</a>. According to him, one factor behind the increasing interest from such companies is the end of the turbulence caused by<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal"> the FTX implosion</a> last year. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Circle&#8217;s CEO suggested the current condition of the crypto sector is much similar to the market after the Dot-com crash in the late 1990s. Back then, phrases like &#8220;e-commerce&#8221; or &#8220;consumer internet&#8221; were frowned upon due to the high uncertainty. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nonetheless, &#8220;the next generation of browser technology, the next generation of digital media technology, broadband infrastructure, Wi-Fi infrastructure, mobile devices&#8221; lit up &#8220;a whole new era,&#8221; Allaire concluded.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What Does the Future Hold?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Allaire described the next five to ten years as &#8220;the programable money era,&#8221; where blockchain technology, AI, smart contracts, and entrepreneurship will reshape trade and commerce.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He went further, saying the financial system will transform the way smartphones are modified after the success of the iPhone.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;It&#8217;s similar to when you lit up broadband for everyone, and you enabled Wi-Fi-connected devices—what became possible, right? Television was reinvented; gaming was reinvented,&#8221; he added.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[The closed-door gathering will be with lawmakers from the New Democrat Coalition, one of the largest caucuses in the House.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Armstrong, the chief executive officer of America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, will privately meet with Democrats from the House of Representatives on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-17/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-set-to-meet-with-house-democrats?sref=3REHEaVI" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, Democratic aides disclosed that the meeting would focus on crypto legislation and related issues like taxes, privacy, and national security.</p>
<h2>Coinbase CEO to Meet With House Democrats</h2>
<p>The closed-door gathering will be with lawmakers from the New Democrat Coalition, one of the largest caucuses in the House that is made up of 100 members who are committed to pro-economic growth, pro-innovation, and fiscally responsible policies.</p>
<p>Armstrong’s meeting with the New Democratic Coalition comes as Coinbase faces a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of securities law violations. Recall that the SEC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" data-wpel-link="internal">accused</a> the crypto exchange of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, clearing agency, and broker last month.</p>
<p>While Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-ceo-welcomes-sec-legal-battle-well-get-the-job-done/" data-wpel-link="internal">fights</a> the SEC’s allegations, Armstrong launched a campaign seeking clearer crypto rules in the U.S. Before the lawsuit, Coinbase petitioned the agency in July 2022, asking for clarity on crypto regulation. After ignoring the exchange’s request, the agency finally <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-responds-to-coinbase-request-for-crypto-clarity-wants-more-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">asked</a> for more time to file a concrete response.</p>
<h2>Armstrong Seeks Clear Crypto Rules</h2>
<p>The Coinbase chief has urged U.S. lawmakers to consider two crypto bills that have been circulating and promise to provide guidance on which regulators will oversee digital assets. Lawmakers from the House and Senate introduced the bills to provide clarity on crypto regulation.</p>
<p>The first one, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100652X1574425&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.4.2-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fpolicy%2F2023%2F06%2F02%2Fus-house-republicans-push-for-crypto-oversight-with-bill-to-make-sec-play-ball%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinancialservices.house.gov%2Fnews%2Fdocumentsingle.aspx%3FDocumentID%3D408838&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=-60&amp;xuuid=e221d84af2894b01674d9afbd13b765a&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">proposed</a> by Republican chairs of the House Financial Services Committee and the House Committee on Agriculture, would enable crypto exchanges to register with the SEC and trade digital securities, commodities, and stablecoins all in one place.</p>
<p>The second, introduced by crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, would require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to oversee exchanges while regulated depository institutions handle stablecoin issuers. The bill was initially <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/senator-cynthia-lummis-bill-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">proposed</a> in June 2022 but <a href="https://www.lummis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Lummis-Gillibrand-2023.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">re-introduced</a> last week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase’s COIN stock is up over 25% since a federal court <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-secondary-sales-of-xrp-not-an-investment-contract-judge-rules-following-over-3-year-long-legal-battle/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled</a> in favor of Ripple Labs in a lawsuit with the SEC concerning XRP’s recognition as a security or investment contract. The partial victory was considered a win for the crypto industry at large. The closed-door gathering will be with lawmakers from the New Democrat Coalition, one of the largest caucuses in the House.</p>
