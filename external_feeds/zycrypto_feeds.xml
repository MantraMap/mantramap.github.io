<ul>
<li>Solana recorded a couple of huge wins this week alongside the Helium migration to start the second quarter on high.</li>



<li>NFTs on Solana remain a major driving force as daily transactions reach an all-time high, pushing its sales volume to 14% of the market share.</li>



<li>The price of SOL has soared over 125% this year, trading at $22.1, leaving pundits with many speculations regarding its run.</li>
</ul>



<p>Solana (SOL) bulls are in a frenzy following the launch of the first Web3-powered smartphone, which makes users acquire digital assets alongside minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) effortlessly.</p>



<p>After the Saga smartphone launch, the community celebrated the Grayscale Solana Trust Shares trading, with its price reacting positively. Powered by the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-smartphone-set-for-early-may-sales-here-are-its-exciting-features/">Solana blockchain, Saga</a> has received a lot of good reviews in its first week on the market, although there has been slight talk about its $1,000 price.</p>



<p>Daily trading volumes of SOL are up to a little over $500 million in addition to the recent Grayscale Trust, which stands at $2.9 million in digital assets under management (AUM). SOL rose 29% to hit a monthly high of $26 before a price correction. This year, it has gained a significant 125%, wiping away sharp losses of last year caused by network downtimes.</p>



<p>As SOL continues to grow alongside the broader market, its NFTs volumes continue to surge significantly and are billed for more growth following the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/helium-finally-migrates-to-the-solana-network-mints-nearly-1-million-nfts-to-mark-milestone/">migration</a> of Helium to its network with 991,000 NFT mints.</p>



<p>On the flip side, some pundits warn that the bullish outlook of SOL in price does not reflect in the derivatives market and may lead to further price correction in Q2 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nfts-to-the-rescue">NFTs to the rescue</h2>



<p>During last year’s turmoil, NFTs were a major driving force of SOL, described by many as ‘<em>fueling DeFi on the network.”</em> Daily NFT transactions of Solana have hit a record high this month, although other DeFi activities, including lending, staking, and decentralized exchange, continue to struggle.</p>



<p>Solana’s NFT market share has grown to 14% from 6% last year, trailing only Ethereum, according to a report from Delphi Digital. Its new NFT Compressor technology released this month makes it easier and cheaper to mint tokens creating more room for expansion. </p>



<p>The technology reduces the cost of minting a million NFTs to $110 and is undergoing tests with the Helium 991,000 NFT announcement. As NFT activities continue on an upward trajectory in Solana, it is still unlikely to see how it will push other DeFi metrics compared to similar networks.</p>

<p>Polygon (MATIC), the Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has recently witnessed a significant movement of tokens from one of the largest self-custody addresses. According to data from Santiment, a blockchain analytics platform, the whale address transferred 60 million MATIC tokens to an exchange, causing the network&#8217;s exchange supply to rise to a 5-week high of 7.92%.</p>



<p>While this may raise concerns, it is worth noting that the whale address still holds a colossal MATIC stash. This means that the movement of 60 million tokens represents only a small portion of the whale&#8217;s total holdings. Nevertheless, any significant movement of tokens by whales, known to hold large amounts of cryptocurrency, can considerably impact market prices.</p>



<p>Traders should be cautious when such <a href="https://zycrypto.com/massive-shiba-inu-whale-moves-over-180-billion-coins-to-exchanges-what-could-go-wrong-for-shib/">whale exchange inflows</a> happen, as they could signal a potential sell-off or a loss of confidence in the cryptocurrency. However, it is essential to remember that the movement of tokens by a single whale address does not necessarily reflect the sentiments of the entire market. Therefore, analysing the situation in the context of the overall market conditions is crucial before making any decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-does-this-mean-for-matic"><strong>So What Does This Mean for MATIC?</strong></h2>



<p>In related news, the price of MATIC had fallen below the $1 mark, prompting many investors to take a closer look at the on-chain activity. According to data from IntoTheBlock, a blockchain analytics firm, 32.56k addresses purchased MATIC at an average price of $0.918. This suggests that if prices were to return to those levels, investor interest might pick up once again.</p>



<p>The dip in price may be an opportunity for traders to enter the market at a lower cost, as the long-term outlook for Polygon remains <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sticking-to-core-fundamentals-saved-polygon-from-ftx-calamity-co-founder-sandeep-nailwal/">positive</a>. The project has seen significant growth in recent months, with many developers and users flocking to its scalable and efficient network. Moreover, Polygon has partnered with numerous <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygons-matic-maintains-upsurge-following-partnership-with-hamilton-lane/">high-profile </a>projects, including Aave, SushiSwap, and Curve, which further validate its potential as a top-tier cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The recent movement of tokens by a whale address and the dip in the price of MATIC should be viewed in the context of the broader market conditions. While caution is advised, investors should also consider the long-term potential of Polygon and the increasing interest from developers and users alike.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride this week. After tapping a ten-month high of $30,800 last week, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization embarked on a downward trajectory shedding around 9% in the past seven days. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $29,225 after a 2% drop in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>Similarly, Ether faced a drawdown, giving back just over 10% in the past seven days to trade at $1,913 at press time. Other cryptocurrencies also retreated, with XRP leading in the top 10 coins by market cap with an 11% slump.</p>



<p>Notably, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-army-anticipates-stellar-dogecoin-rally-to-the-moon-as-dogeday-approaches/">Dogecoin</a> also dropped sharply. At press time, the world’s most popular meme had shed over 8% in the past 24 hours despite posting sizeable gains Thursday as billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched a test rocket only for it to explode shortly after.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-could-drop-lower-pundit-warns"><strong>Bitcoin Could Drop Lower, Pundit Warns</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, as the market ends the week with its head down, various experts have cautioned that Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptos could slide lower.</p>



<p>According to Michael Michaël van de Poppe, founder of crypto trading firm Eight Global, Bitcoin “is currently showing weakness” and could drop to $26,200, where he sees the next support level. In a Friday tweet, the pundit warned that Bitcoin has lost &#8220;one crucial level&#8221; in its recent decline.</p>



<p><em>“Bitcoin is currently showing weakness. Broke back in the range, lost one of the crucial levels. The final crucial level is at $27,600. Could take liquidity beneath, but needs a fast recovery. If not, and no break of $28,800, then I suspect we&#8217;ll see $26,200,”</em> said Michael.</p>



<p>According to crypto analyst “Crazzyblockk” from Cryptoquant, Bitcoin risks dropping <a href="https://zycrypto.com/long-traders-feel-the-pain-as-bitcoins-dramatic-fall-to-29000-leads-to-241-million-liquidations/">even lower</a>. In a post today, the pundit highlighted Bitcoin’s UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution chart showing Bitcoin’s 1-week to 1-month age bands.</p>



<p>UTXO is a set of realized prices along with age bands. The metrics help us to overview each cohort&#8217;s holding behaviour by overlaying a set of different realized prices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="567" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-19.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80285" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-19.png 900w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-19-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-19-768x484.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>He noted that the $28.3k price level was a valuable zone for the bands, describing it as “a psychological level for a realized price.” According to him, the $28k level will determine the reaction of the traders in this price age and the need to take short-term profit from the asset’s recent rally.</p>



<p><em>“If Bitcoin receives a reaction from the short-term at these levels, it will be a sign of renewed interest in holding and entry by these people, and if this level breaking, these players will continue to sell,”</em> he said adding, <em>“If this level breaking, the oncoming valuable level is in the range of 25-23k.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-20-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80286" width="1035" height="675"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, despite the recent drop in price, many still believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, especially with the biting inflation and growing discontentment with global monetary systems.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, managed to end the week on a strong note, defying bearish pressure and a wave of negative regulatory news.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency started the week on a promising note but faced extreme volatility Wednesday before stabilizing as reports of the collapse of First Republic Bank shares sparked fresh <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-price-makes-slight-gains-in-the-wake-of-first-republic-banks-imminent-price-fall/">banking crisis fears</a> in the United States. Unfounded rumours of imminent bitcoin sales by the US government and Mt Gox creditors further compounded the negative sentiment.</p>



<p>Arkham Intelligence, the firm accused of sending the false Bitcoin sales alerts, however, came out denying any wrongdoing, noting that the mistake could have arisen from an alert sent by a third party. The incident coincided with a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price, which fell 6% in about one hour.</p>



<p>Besides interest rate concerns amid sky-high inflation, regulatory pressure has also been mounting on the crypto sector. Earlier this week, Binance CEO Changapeng Zhao <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/technology/binance-crypto-crackdown.html">reportedly</a> hired a team of defence lawyers to represent him personally as the exchange faces scrutiny from multiple US investigators.</p>



<p>On Thursday, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, stated that the exchange “will defend itself vigorously in litigation if it comes to that” referencing the wells notice it recently received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These moves could compel more crypto players in the US to fight back, with major financial regulators remaining adamant about engaging them through dialogue, according to some industry experts.</p>



<p>That said, despite Bitcoin remaining strong in the face of mounting regulatory concerns and FUD, some pundits have, however warned that it could still plunge lower. According to Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist at InTheMoneyStocks, crypto winter may still be far from over. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2INAcG5AB1M&amp;ab_channel=KitcoNEWS">interview</a> with Kitco, the pundit shared his predictions for Bitcoin, noting that $30,500 could be a very hard resistance to break. He warned investors against falling for Bitcoin’s recent resurgence, suggesting it&#8217;s a bull trap.</p>



<p><em>“Don&#8217;t be fooled. I&#8217;ve been through many bear markets and commodities in the stock market in crypto in my trading career and sometimes it turns out to be the lipstick on the pig here,</em> and it could still roll over and head lower. So, I still think there&#8217;s a chance for $12,000 to$13 000- maybe even nine thousand,<em>”</em> he said.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at about $29,215, up roughly 0.76% over the past 24 hours. In the past week, the cryptocurrency has gained about 4.55%, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Binance chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, has taken to Twitter to refute the accuracy of his fortune, as reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>. CZ indicated that the numbers are wrong, and his net worth is nowhere near the figure reported by the mainstream media.</p>



<p>Although Binance does not disclose its annual revenues and CZ’s stake in the exchange, Bloomberg estimated that Zhao is worth $28.2 billion and ranked him 3rd in the top 25 finance billionaires worldwide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-rich-is-cz"><strong>How Rich Is CZ?</strong></h2>



<p>Binance&#8217;s CEO claims to be worth way less than what Bloomberg estimated.</p>



<p>In an April 27 <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1651467819400278016">tweet</a>, CZ pointed out that Bloomberg’s latest finance-rich list had inaccurate data about his crypto fortune. Per the publication’s list, the Binance boss’s net worth stands at a whopping $28.2 billion, ranking him the third richest finance billionaire in the world. Bloomberg also estimated Binance’s annual revenue at around $12 billion.</p>



<p>“Numbers all wrong. I don&#8217;t have anywhere near as much. Don&#8217;t know why they do this,” Zhao tweeted. The crypto billionaire also wrote “4”, suggesting his net worth should be somewhere around Dan Gilbert’s $19.4 billion and Uday Kotak’s $13 billion.</p>



<p>In a follow-up tweet, CZ said he is a “small potato in a small (but growing) industry” when a Twitter user suggested the Binance founder is richer than Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>Well-known within the cryptosphere, Zhao began receiving more news coverage last November during the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange FTX. Contrary to popular belief, CZ clarified in his latest tweet that he had never viewed the now-defunct FTX as a rival. “We welcome more (well-run) exchanges in the space,” he added.</p>



<p>Following the implosion of FTX, Zhao has become one the most prominent names left standing in the crypto world, and Binance’s business now considerably surpasses every other digital asset exchange by huge margins.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Zhao is spotlighting reporting inaccuracies by mainstream media. The CEO has previously described articles published by Forbes or Bloomberg as FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>Binance and CZ are currently facing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">lawsuit </a>from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on allegations of violating derivatives laws and helping users conceal their locations to evade trading restrictions.</p>

<ul>
<li>The bridging solution is enhanced with fast finality and improved user experience.</li>



<li>Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta went live in March as an open-source, permissionless, and public platform.</li>
</ul>



<p>Polygon, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has integrated a PoS bridge to its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), according to an April 26 statement.</p>



<p>Polygon Bridge for zkEVM has almost the same user experience as that of Polygon PoS but with some enhancements, including a visible progress bar, a transaction panel with colour-coded completion status, a time estimate for pending transactions, and a filter.</p>



<p>Also important to note is the improved finality of the zkEVM Polygon Bridge, reportedly allowing users to claim funds on the Ethereum mainnet in between 30-60 seconds. Per the developers, bridges using zero-knowledge technology are better than competing technologies because they are based entirely on smart contracts. Additionally, no mapping is required.</p>



<p><em>‘‘Once a user triggers the bridging transaction, the token being bridged will automatically be mapped. This is a major UX improvement compared to other chains, which require users to map tokens before bridging – a process that can take hours or even days,’’ Polygon <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/announcing-polygon-bridge-for-polygon-zkevm-2?utm_source=zkevm-bridge-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog">wrote</a>. </em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zkevm-enhancing-polygon-s-scalability-of-ethereum"><strong>zkEVM enhancing Polygon’s scalability of Ethereum</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon had its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) mainnet beta <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygons-zkevm-mainnet-beta-goes-live-unlocking-limitless-possibilities-for-ethereum-compatible-dapps/">launch</a> last month, a significant milestone in the network aimed at improving the scalability of the decentralized applications (dApps) built on Ethereum.</p>



<p>zkEVM is enabled with zero-knowledge proofs, a technology allowing data validation without revealing the data itself. Polygon developers tout the technology as key in enhancing the security and privacy of dApps cost-effectively and efficiently.</p>



<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin endorsed zkEVM, becoming the first to complete a successful transaction of 0.005 ETH sent to a random address. Some of the dApps using zkEVM include Lens and Balancer. Infrastructure providers like ANKR, The Graph, and Alchemy also use the platform.</p>



<p>Polygon is also making strides in other areas around zero-knowledge technology, recently introducing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-hits-it-big-with-new-web3-id-service-based-on-zero-knowledge-proofs/">decentralized identity solution</a> giving developers tools to create self-sovereign, decentralized, and private identity solutions based on zero-knowledge proofs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Circle launches USDC cross-chain transfer protocol across Ethereum and Avalanche, cutting off the use of third-party bridges. </li>



<li>The team behind the project says the move will ease the user experience, improve market liquidity, and aid capital efficiency.</li>



<li>The CEO of Circle expects a turnaround amid plunging market cap and regulatory concerns in the past few months.</li>
</ul>



<p>The race for interoperability among stablecoins has heightened in recent years as networks seek to make digital ecosystems less fragmented and exclusive.</p>



<p>Circle, the company behind the USD Coin (USDC), has released a mainnet protocol that allows users to transfer USDC between Avalanche and Ethereum networks seamlessly. The Cross Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) will work without third-party bridges meaning that users will no longer be required to deposit their assets with a Circle partner to transfer assets between networks.</p>



<p>According to the team, unlike traditional bridges, this transfer protocol burns all tokens and issues new ones on the receiving blockchain. Assets will not need to be stored on the sending chain before being claimed on the other network.</p>



<p>Joao Geginatto, the vice president of Circle, has expressed faith in the protocol stating that it will improve liquidity, ease user experience and help capital efficiency in DeFi.</p>



<p>“<em>With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience, and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe, and fungible asset in native USDC.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>According to Circle, several top cross-chain protocols, like MetaMask, Cela, LayerZero, Wormhole, etc, have pledged to integrate the new transfer protocol.</p>



<p>The CCTP solves the fragmentation and exclusive problems attributed to most chains. Furthermore, the issues linked with unofficial versions of USDC in several networks due to bridge issues will gradually become history with the CCTP as the official way of transferring the asset.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-innovation-is-the-only-way-out">Innovation is the only way out</h2>



<p>With developers churning out new upgrades and features, USDC has a chance to reclaim its over $50 billion market cap. USDC has been in the waters for months due to technical and regulatory issues. In March, the stablecoin lost its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/usdc-stablecoin-loses-dollar-peg-following-collapse-of-major-banking-partner/">peg</a> after the revelation that it had $3.3 billion Silicon Valley Bank in the wake of the bank’s saga.</p>



<p>To compound the stablecoin woes, it has consistently lost market share to its rival Tether in Q1 2023. Amidst the uptick in the digital asset market in the past three months leading to a market cap of $1.2 trillion, USDC recorded losses of 26.9% while Terra gained 20.9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire blamed the dwindling market share of USDC on the current state of crypto regulation in the US as the SEC crackdown continues.</p>

<p>Lawyers of Voyager Digital were taken aback when Binance.US called off its deal to acquire the assets of the insolvent crypto lender on Tuesday. The deal had been approved by a judge last week in the bankruptcy court.</p>



<p>Voyager will now have to distribute cash and crypto to customers using its platform following Binance.US’s about-face.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprised"><strong>“Surprised”</strong></h2>



<p>Voyager attorneys were “surprised” Binance.US <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917">terminated </a>its asset buy deal.</p>



<p>In a bankruptcy court in the Southern District Court of New York on Wednesday, the lawyers posited that the exchange was still displaying interest as recently as last week.</p>



<p>“The debtors have been in constant contact and communication with Binance.US, and as lately as this past Friday, Binance.US had expressed the desire to close the transaction as soon as possible,” Christine Okike of law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, representing Voyager, stated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Binance.US Nuked Voyager Deal</strong></h2>



<p>Binance backed out of its deal to acquire Voyager’s assets due to what it described as a “hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.” Following the termination of the deal, recoveries for Voyager’s creditors will likely be in the range of 40% to 65%, Okike noted. This depends on whether Voyager wins a parallel suit involving now-defunct digital asset exchange FTX and how much recovery FTX offers its creditors.</p>



<p>Voyager was among multiple crypto companies to go under last year after the abrupt fall of Terra’s LUNA governance token and the UST algorithmic stablecoin. The crypto broker declared bankruptcy on July 5.</p>



<p>A number of regulators sought to block the deal, which would have allowed Voyager customers to become Binance.US customers. That included the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Trade Commission, the Texas State Securities Board, and the Texas Department of Banking.</p>



<p>Binance.US’s withdrawal comes after its international affiliate found itself in the cross-hairs of regulators in the United States. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-ether-slump-as-cftc-sues-binance-and-cz-over-willful-violation-of-u-s-laws/">launched </a>a lawsuit against Binance last month, accusing the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume of violating derivatives rules. In fact, some <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1650941963955236887">speculated </a>that Binance.US’s decision to pull out of the Voyager agreement could be part of the conditions of a forthcoming settlement with the CFTC.</p>

<p>The Bahamas is gearing up to tighten its crypto regulations in a bid to protect investors after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire — largely based in the nation— was swiftly wiped out last November.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stiffer-crypto-regulation-incoming-following-ftx-collapse"><strong>Stiffer Crypto Regulation Incoming Following FTX Collapse</strong></h2>



<p>Months after the implosion of FTX put the Bahamas on the spot, the Caribbean nation is preparing to impose more stringent regulations on crypto assets, as per an April 25 <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf">statement </a>from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB).</p>



<p>The laws, packaged in the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) bill, including expanding the definition of digital assets businesses, measures on stablecoins, proof-of-work mining, as well as covering crypto services such as advice, derivatives, and crypto staking.</p>



<p>Under the new rulebook, “operators of a digital asset exchange must ensure the systems and controls used in its activities are adequate and appropriate for the scale and nature of its business.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Bahamas, which passed crypto laws previously dubbed the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act in 2020, was home to Bankman-Fried and his once multi-billion-dollar digital asset exchange FTX, which went under last year. FTX’s new CEO John Ray III has since accused the Bahamian government of directing unauthorized access to the exchange to obtain digital assets that should be under the control of FTX. </p>



<p>Moreover, Bankman-Fried was also accused of using corporate funds to purchase luxury penthouses in the island nation. The disgraced CEO has pleaded not guilty to charges brought against him for his role in the astonishing FTX collapse, and his criminal trial is set to take place in October.</p>



<p>Ms. Christina Rolle, Executive Director of the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, noted that once passed, the proposed DARE legislation would become “among the most advanced pieces of digital asset legislation in the world and will align with The Bahamas’ commitment to facilitating development and innovation in a well-regulated environment.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bahamas Prohibits Algorithmic Stablecoins</strong></h2>



<p>In order to prevent another crypto disaster, the Bahamas&#8217; regulator is also banning the issuance of algorithmic stablecoins in response to last May’s collapse of TerraUSD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you can recall, the blowup of the Terra ecosystem, which stemmed from the depegging of UST from the U.S. dollar, ignited a deep downturn that obliterated investors’ funds and also undermined the reputation of the entire cryptocurrency sector. It also triggered a domino effect that saw many other prominent crypto-focused firms experiencing liquidity problems or filing for bankruptcy protection.</p>



<p>Specifically, the upcoming regulation will introduce “a new and comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins” whose value is tied to the United States dollar or another stable asset.</p>



<p>Public consultation for the new bill will run until May 31, and the regulator hopes it will become law by the end of the second quarter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin, which has steadily climbed about 70% since the start of 2023, was trading hands at a price of $29,728.28 at press time.</p>

<p>A class action lawsuit brought against Ripple four years ago by investors who claim that XRP is a security is set to continue.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Crypto Law, a regulatory news website for digital assets, provided the update noting that a hearing on the case will take place on April 26 in a California federal court where parties in the Zakinov v. Ripple lawsuit will be heard.</p>



<p>The website further noted that only 500 members of the public should be allowed online access to the proceedings. As per the announcement, “the hearing is for oral arguments on the question of certifying the class of XRP holders suing Ripple.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Background to the Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-suffers-a-serious-blow-as-court-denies-ripples-motion-to-dismiss-securities-lawsuit/">The lawsuit</a> was brought against Ripple and Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, by the plaintiff in 2019, Vladi Zakinov, and two other individuals through investor Bradley Sostack, the lead plaintiff in the consolidated lawsuit.</p>



<p>As per the plaint, Vladi Zakinov sued the defendants claiming that XRP is an unregistered security, after suffering a considerable loss from the sale of XRP in January 2018. The plaintiff also sought to ratify the case into a class action lawsuit that generally included all persons or entities who purchased XRP. However, the defendants maintained that XRP is not a security asking the court to dismiss the claim. </p>



<p>As per the announcement by Crypto Law, today’s hearing will be for oral arguments on the question of certifying the class of XRP holders suing Ripple.</p>



<p><em>“The plaintiff, Bradley Sostak, who owned XRP for two weeks, is asking to be lead plaintiff in the class and is asking to represent all XRP holders who either owned it and sold it at a loss or own it today,”</em> Crypto Law wrote.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, John Deaton, who had previously filed an amicus brief on behalf of 75K+ XRP holders in the case, commented that he intends to follow the proceedings, although his motion is yet to be ruled on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-battle-with-the-sec"><strong>Ripple’s Battle With The SEC</strong></h2>



<p>That said, as Ripple battles out the case, the community is still focused on what will come from the firm’s parallel battle <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-has-the-sec-failed-to-legally-prove-that-xrp-is-a-security-this-web3-lawyer-thinks-so/">with the SEC</a>. With most of the briefs finalized now, it is expected that Judge Analisa Torres could deliver a summary judgement soon.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the ongoing legal battles have increased dilemmas among investors torn between selling their holdings or waiting for the ruling. Nonetheless, with SEC’s apparent onslaught on the crypto sector despite the lack of sufficient regulations, most observers believe Ripple could bag a win, helping XRP to break new ground.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.47, up 3.26% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Solana, one of the largest Proof-of-Stake networks in the world, has made a major entry into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) with the launch of an open-source reference implementation for a ChatGPT plugin.</p>



<p>Announcing the move Tuesday, Solana Labs noted that the new plugin would let users interact with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-smartphone-set-for-early-may-sales-here-are-its-exciting-features/">Solana</a> network directly from ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Chat GPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, a company that was co-founded by billionaire Elon Musk in 2015. Since its launch last November, ChatGPT has quickly garnered global popularity due to its AI-powered chatbot, which generates sophisticated responses to just about any prompt. From passing tough exams in various fields such as business, medicine and law, many now see ChatGPT as revolutionizing work.</p>



<p>To this end, various industries have started to leverage this technology, including players in the crypto sector who seek to enhance user experience and make their products more accessible.</p>



<p>The new ChatGPT plugin allows developers to build AI-powered applications on top of the Solana network, opening up a wide range of possibilities for businesses and individuals alike. It is also important to note that the new reference implementation is fully open-source, meaning anyone can use it to build their applications.</p>



<p>Solana Labs further noted that once ChatGPT plugins are available, users will be able “to check wallet balance, transfer tokens, and purchase NFTs,” sharing a screenshot on what to expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="817" height="978" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80188" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11.png 817w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11-251x300.png 251w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-11-768x919.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1m-grant-from-ai-developers"><strong>$1M Grant from AI Developers</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, earlier today, the Solana Foundation announced that it would be allocating grants to ecosystem teams building AI tools atop Solana. According to the non-profit, such individuals or teams can seek a grant from a $1M fund which aims to give each project from $5,0000 to $25,000.</p>



<p><em>“Solana&#8217;s high throughput and scalability provide a unique opportunity to build brand new ideas with AI. These grants are meant to encourage the Solana ecosystem to explore new use cases of these novel technologies,”</em> the foundation tweeted.</p>



<p>That said, Solana (SOL) has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-predicts-why-solana-could-bounce-back-even-better/">on a tear</a>, soaring over 8% in the past 24 hours to trade at $22 at press time as investors met the announcement with great enthusiasm. Despite suffering incessant network outages, Tuesday’s announcement represents a significant milestone for Solana, considering AI can enhance user experience and improve the network&#8217;s overall health.</p>

<p>On April 24, 2023, the European Central Bank (ECB) published the findings of focus groups and in-depth interviews in all euro area countries from December 2022 to January 2023. The study aimed at soliciting views on the features of a potential digital wallet targeted a cross-section of participants ranging from the general population, the tech-savvy, merchants, and the underbanked.</p>



<p>According to the study, the underbanked category was the only target group uncomfortable with adopting a new digital payment solution. Awareness and knowledge of digital wallets within the underbanked groups were generally low. The focus groups also found that the underbanked had general mistrust of the banking system. The underbanked also carried out most transactions using cash.</p>



<p>As per the ECB study, the underbanked were defined as participants who may hold a bank account but rarely use banking services or other payment apps and direct debits. The underbanked were low-income earners who considered a bank account an unnecessary additional cost. The underbanked who had a smartphone used them mostly for making and receiving calls, using social apps, and playing games.</p>



<p>The focus groups found that the underbanked did not have worthwhile reasons to learn how to use digital banking services for fear that their knowledge would soon be obsolete. The underbanked acknowledged society’s gradual shift from cash and recognized they would have to deal with digital payments at some point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some underbanked imagined having a digital wallet but would not use it for large sums of money to limit their losses in case of any problems. The study found that younger respondents were more willing than older respondents to adopt the digital wallet.</p>



<p>On April 20, 2023, the European Union (EU) Parliament approved the first rules to trace crypto-asset transfers, prevent money laundering, and common supervision and customer protection rules. The <em>“travel rule already used in traditional finance will require information on crypto asset transfers to be stored on both sides of the transfer.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) is the EU’s proposed regulatory scheme that aims to cover issuers of crypto assets, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) and to protect crypto asset holders.</p>



<p>Crypto proponents have argued that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) can enable the underbanked and the unbanked to access opportunities and products not traditionally available to them via traditional finance.</p>



<p>Although proponents have argued that cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide easy access to financial services to the underbanked, opponents of cryptocurrency believe that there are other ways to address financial inclusion rather than through cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The global NFT market has seen a significant downturn recently, with various platforms and investors feeling the impact. As the hype surrounding NFTs subsided last year, the market experienced a correction, leading to a decline in trading volumes and valuations.</p>



<p>OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces, has been hit particularly hard, with its valuation now facing a significant cut by one of its most prominent investors, Tiger Global. According to a recent report by The Information, Tiger Global, a $13 billion tech-focused venture fund, recently disclosed that its equity in OpenSea has dropped from $126.8 million to $30.2 million, representing a 76% drawdown. The firm became one of the largest investors in OpenSea when the NFT platform raised $300 million during a Series C round earlier last year. </p>



<p>Last December, the firm reported a 20% paper loss, with over half of that drawdown coming from its crypto-related investments. The New York-based firm established its venture fund in 2021 before placing sizeable bets on blue-chip crypto startups. Some other notable firms that the firm had reportedly dabbled in include Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs, MoonPay, and FTX, which went under last November, completely wiping out the firm’s investment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFTs Tank Alongside Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the number of NFT projects growing to record highs in the past year, the overall income of the industry has been dwindling as crypto prices dump. In the past year or so, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, have dipped by over 70%, a scenario that could have triggered a loss of interest in NTFs.</p>



<p>In its recent report, Tiger Global valued OpenSea at just $3Billion, despite the popular NFT marketplace hitting a $13.3 billion valuation at the height of NFT mania last year. This value drop has been largely attributed to the drop in NFT sales plummet and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blur-vs-opensea-battle-for-nft-marketplace-supremacy-rages-on/">increased competition</a> from rival platforms like Blur.</p>



<p>But OpenSea is not the only casualty of the NFT market downturn. Other platforms, including Rarible, have also seen a decline in trading volumes and valuations. Meanwhile, high-profile NFT sales have slowed, with many artists and collectors holding back as the market cools off.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-is-still-hope"><strong>There Is Still Hope</strong></h2>



<p>That said, despite the downturn, there are still reasons to be optimistic about the future of NFTs. According to a recent report by DAPP Radar, despite a disappointing end to the year 2022, NFTs had a strong Q1 2023, with a 137.04% increase in trading volume to $4.7 billion, the highest since Q2 2022.</p>



<p>This renewed growth has been fuelled by the launch of new marketplaces and protocols such as NFTFi, which seek to bridge the gap between DeFi and NFT ecosystems by introducing various approaches to unlock liquidity for NFTs.</p>

<p>Hidden in all versions of the Apple MacOS since 2018, a copy of the original Bitcoin white paper penned by the pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto will not be part of the next update, Apple-focused news publication <em>9to5Mac </em>has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/25/apple-removes-bitcoin-whitepaper-from-macos/">reported</a>.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shockingly-bitcoin-whitepaper-has-been-hidden-inside-mac-computers-for-years/"><em>ZyCrypto </em></a>reported about three weeks ago, a post from prominent technologist Andy Baio revealed that a PDF copy of Satoshi’s Bitcoin white paper had been shipped in every version of MacOS from Mojave to Ventura.</p>



<p><em>“Of all the documents in the world, why was the Bitcoin whitepaper chosen? Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple?&#8221; Baio asked on his blog Waxy. &#8220;Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The document was hidden within Virtual Scanner II, which was not enabled by default. The file went unnoticed by the tech giant’s millions of users and was believed to be a joke among Apple engineers or even included as a subtle endorsement of Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. It even prompted self-proclaimed (and much-contested) Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright, who has long attempted to copyright the Bitcoin white paper and has been suing places that host it, to <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_CSWright/status/1643882093875740673">suggest </a>that Apple was breaching his copyright.</p>



<p>However, Apple has now removed the document from the latest version of the Mac operating system. A look at the Beta Software Program, upcoming version 13.4 of MacOS Ventura, shows it does not contain the entire Virtual Scanner 11 tool, which may have been included in the system for testing purposes. The white paper was located in hidden system files and was not intended to be discovered by everyday users.</p>



<p><em>“This pretty much confirms our original theory that both the Bitcoin white paper and the internal tool were never meant to be found by regular users,” 9to5Mac observed.</em></p>



<p>Alongside Satoshi’s white paper was a nondescript image of a sign at Treasure Island in San Francisco.</p>



<p>The enigma surrounding the inclusion and subsequent scrapping of the Bitcoin white paper from macOS remains unanswered. With Apple remaining mum on the subject, the crypto community is left to weigh the implications and the stance of the world’s largest tech company.</p>
