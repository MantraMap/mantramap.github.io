This is a basic principle for building our union, and we must reach this target as soon as possible.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Belarus Prioritizes Building Economic Union With &#8216;No Barriers and No Restrictions at All&#8217;</h2>
<p>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko outlined his country&#8217;s priorities and response to sanctions during the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting in Moscow on Thursday. The meeting was chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Lukashenko explained that Belarus&#8217; response to sanctions is to strengthen cooperation within major multinational organizations, such as the BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The BRICS economic bloc comprises Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa. The Belarus leader said (translated by Google):</p>
<blockquote><p>Our response to the sanctions pressure is to intensify cooperation within the SCO, BRICS, and ASEAN, to close new trade agreements, and [engage in] constructive and mutually beneficial cooperation with everybody who is interested in being our friends and partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Having said that, I want to note that as a result, we must ensure the balance of interests between all the parties involved. It is not an easy task but I am confident that the commission has the skills and competence required,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Lukashenko continued: &#8220;The modern world is undergoing global changes and entering an era of major transition and strategic development. There is increasing awareness of the need to replace the unipolar system of management with new decision-making centers that ensure the consideration of interests of all participants in international relations.&#8221; He stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The creation of a comprehensive economic union remains our priority &#8230; There should be no barriers and no restrictions at all. This is a basic principle for building our union, and we must reach this target as soon as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Colleagues, I believe that, by taking joint efforts, we can fully realize the potential of this union internally and externally, thus creating one of the full-weight responsible centers of the new multipolar world,&#8221; the Belarus leader concluded.</p>

<p>The Belarusian leader also spoke at the Eurasian Economic Forum in Moscow Wednesday. &#8220;Financial, pandemic, [and] geopolitical crises are replacing each other so quickly that people simply do not have time to take a breath and lose confidence in the future,” Lukashenko opined, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world has been recently living in a constant state of tension and uncertainty. This is also natural in the transition period from the old era to the new one, to which we aspire and whose name is multipolarity.</p></blockquote>
<p>While noting that in extraordinary circumstances, a stable economy serves as a strong foundation, he emphasized that in today&#8217;s interconnected world with transparent economic borders and intertwined trade relations, it becomes nearly impossible for any nation to achieve economic stability on its own. He added that consequently, countries are increasingly motivated to seek membership in influential regional and international organizations, such as the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), SCO, BRICS, and ASEAN.</p>

He highlighted that the central bank of Russia has already begun investing its reserves in yuan, and over 70% of the trade turnover between Russia and China is settled in yuan along with the ruble.</strong></p>
<h2>VTB Bank President Expects Chinese Yuan to Replace US Dollar as World’s Reserve Currency</h2>
<p>Russia’s VTB Bank Chairman Andrey Kostin reportedly said at a Russian-Chinese business forum in Shanghai last week that the Chinese yuan will replace the U.S. dollar as the world&#8217;s reserve and settlement currency in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is now the world&#8217;s second-largest economy and will soon become the first,” he was quoted by Sputnik as saying. The executive added:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is every reason to expect that the Chinese yuan will replace the U.S. dollar as the world&#8217;s main reserve and settlement currency as early as the next decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>“In fact, the central bank of Russia is already investing its reserves in yuan, and more than 70 percent of trade turnover between Russia and China is settled in yuan together with the ruble,&#8221; Kostin continued.</p>
<p>The VTB Bank chairman explained that the monetary and financial system that has been in place for decades ensures the hegemony of the U.S. and its Western allies, with the USD and the euro accounting for three-quarters of global settlements. He stressed that while the dollar is the world&#8217;s main reserve currency, the collective West, particularly the U.S., has been using the USD as a weapon.</p>
<p>In February, the U.S. Treasury Department announced &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; and &#8220;expansive&#8221; <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0608">sanctions</a> against VTB Bank and Sberbank — Russia&#8217;s two largest banks.</p>

<p>Russia and China have been increasingly strengthening their economic ties and using their national currencies in trade transactions. In April, the Chinese yuan surpassed the U.S. dollar as the most traded currency in Russia. This trend is expected to continue in the future as both countries seek to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Multiple people have warned that the weaponization of the U.S. dollar will lead to the USD <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-us-dollars-time-coming-to-an-end-as-countries-seek-alternatives/">losing its global reserve currency status</a>. A growing number of countries are pushing for the use of national currencies to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. The BRICS economic bloc has been ramping up its de-dollarization efforts and has proposed a common currency. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">Ten Southeast Asian nations</a> have agreed to promote the use of national currencies and recently top officials of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/9-asian-countries-discuss-de-dollarization-measures-in-meeting-hosted-by-iran/">nine Asian countries</a> met in Iran to discuss de-dollarization measures. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not see a &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-foresees-no-rapid-shift-in-us-dollar-reserves-despite-rising-de-dollarization-trend/">rapid shift</a>&#8221; in USD reserves despite the rising de-dollarization trend.</p>

The talks come as the bank, created as an alternative to similar institutions led by the West, seeks to expand its funding options amid sanctions on one of its founding shareholders, Russia. </strong></p>
<h2>BRICS Development Bank Engaged in ‘Qualified Dialogue’ With Saudi Kingdom</h2>
<p>The Shanghai-based New Development Bank (<a href="https://www.ndb.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NDB</a>), established by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), is in talks with Saudi Arabia on admitting the country as a member, the Financial Times reported.</p>
<p>The negotiations come as the NDB prepares to evaluate its options to attract funding during its annual meeting starting on Tuesday, affected by the penalties imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, the British daily noted.</p>
<p>“In the Middle East, we attach great importance to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and are currently engaged in a qualified dialogue with them,” the New Development Bank told the newspaper in a statement while Riyadh officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s accession would strengthen its ties with the world’s largest developing economies, on the one hand. And on the other, it would provide the ‘BRICS bank’ with access to funds from the world’s second-largest oil producer.</p>

<p>Dependence on Russia, which holds a 19% stake in the NDB, has been the cause of serious concerns. Last July, the rating agency Fitch downgraded the bank’s credit rating to double-A from double-A plus, warning that “reputational risk” could limit its access to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-re-taps-into-usd-bond-market-with-1-25-billion-green-bonds/">U.S. dollar bond market</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, the NDB was forced to put on hold its Russia exposure of $1.7 billion, or 6.7% of its total assets, and halt funding new Russian projects. The move was intended to reassure investors about its compliance with Western sanctions on Moscow. In May of this year, the agency revised its outlook from “negative” to “stable,” noting the steps taken by the bank.</p>
<p>According to Ashwani Muthoo, director-general of the NDB’s independent evaluation office, fundraising options are “the most important thing” right now. “We are struggling to mobilize resources,” he said. Muthoo added that the board wants to examine alternative instruments and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">currencies</a>.</p>
<p>The five BRICS countries founded the NDB in 2015 to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-sees-brics-bank-as-alternative-financial-institution-president-lula-says/">challenge</a> Western-dominated financial institutions of this kind. Since its establishment, the bank has lent around $33 billion to almost 100 development projects and admitted the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bangladesh as members.</p>

However, since that time, the AI-centric crypto market has experienced a loss of more than $1 billion in value.</strong></p>
<h2>The Decline in AI-Driven Cryptocurrencies: $1 Billion Wiped Out From Market</h2>
<p>At the start of the year, products incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) witnessed substantial demand with the rise of AI-focused software noted throughout 2023. This trend permeated into the cryptocurrency sphere, resulting in up to 74 AI-centric tokens amounting to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/artificial-intelligence-crypto-assets-continue-to-surge-accounting-for-4-billion-in-market-value/">value of $4.03 billion</a> by the end of February. At its peak, the AI crypto market recorded a $444.39 million 24-hour trade volume on February 27, 2023.</p>
<p>Presently, both trade volume and market valuation within the AI crypto sector have significantly decreased. <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/ai/">Data</a> from cryptoslate.com reveals that a total of 89 crypto assets tied to AI are currently valued at $2.93 billion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-590774 size-full" title="AI-Centric Crypto Market Loses Over $1 Billion in Value in 90 Days " src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aitdou.jpg" alt="AI-Centric Crypto Market Loses Over $1 Billion in Value in 90 Days " width="1280" height="425" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aitdou-300x100.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aitdou-1024x340.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aitdou-768x255.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aitdou.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Despite an additional 15 AI-centric tokens being introduced, $1.1 billion in value has exited the AI crypto space in the past 90 days. On Sunday, May 28, approximately $409 million worth of trades took place involving AI-focused tokens.</p>
<p>When the AI-crypto economy peaked at $4 billion, it accounted for 0.37% of the overall crypto market&#8217;s net worth. As of now, the AI-crypto industry merely makes up 0.26% of the complete crypto economy&#8217;s total value over the weekend. Over the past month, all top five AI crypto assets have suffered losses.</p>
<p>The largest AI crypto by market cap, graph (GRT), lost 12.27%. Singularitynet (AGIX), ranking second in terms of market capitalization among AI cryptos, lost 8.25% against the U.S. dollar during this period.</p>

<p>Additionally, ocean protocol (OCEAN) experienced a decline of 3.66% against the USD, while fetch (FET) encountered the most significant losses among the top five AI currencies in the past month, dropping 22.84%. As for iexec rlc (RLC), the fifth largest AI coin based on market cap, it saw minimal losses of merely 0.05% within the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Despite these losses, all five experienced 24-hour gains, and two of the top five AI tokens by market cap recorded seven-day gains — including AGIX increasing by 4.29% and OCEAN rising by 6.95% over the past week.</p>

At present, roughly 3.51 ether is burned every single minute. Standing out as a prominent participant in the burn process since August 5, 2021, just below conventional <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> transfers, is the Opensea platform, which has contributed to the burning of 230,050 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>More Than $6 Billion in Value Destroyed Since EIP-1559</h2>
<p>Back on August 5, 2021, a significant event occurred in Ethereum&#x2019;s history with the implementation of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md">(EIP) 1559</a> as part of the<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-says-eip-1559-most-important-part-of-london-network-is-burning-16k-in-eth-per-minute/"> London upgrade</a>. Since then, 660 days have passed. In the initial three months alone, over 700,000 ether was burned, setting the stage for what was to come.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the end of May 2023, utilizing the latest burn metrics, EIP-1559 has fueled the burning of 3.33 million ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) with a value of $6.1 billion, reflecting current ether exchange rates. Since the upgrade, the primary driving force behind this burning lies in the everyday traditional transfers of ether.</p>

<p>Figures reveal that conventional ether transactions have led to the destruction of a substantial sum of 285,576 ether, valued at $522 million. Notably, the Opensea platform stands as the second largest contributor to this burning since August 2021, with 230,050 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> going up in flames as a result of associated transactions.</p>
<p>Equally noteworthy, transactions associated with Uniswap v2 have contributed to the destruction of 179,571 ether since 2021. When combining the effects of conventional ether transfers, Opensea, and Uniswap-related transactions, the collective burn amounts to a tally of nearly 700,000 ether.</p>

<p>Since 2021, Tether&#x2019;s ERC20 transactions have played a role in the burning of 146,837 ether, while Uniswap v3 transfers have contributed to the burning of 120,889 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. Alongside these notable burners, the all-time leaderboard also features prominent contributors such as Metamask, USDC, Otherdeed, and the creation of new contracts.</p>
<p>Over the past seven days, the burn rate is 3.51 ether per minute, resulting in the destruction of more than 28,000 ethereum. Notably, the seven-day statistics reveal that Uniswap-associated transactions have outpaced conventional <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> transfers, further solidifying its position at the forefront of today&#x2019;s top burners.</p>

<p>In the United States, the current <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-house-price-state/#:~:text=Average%20home%20price%20in%20the,when%20the%20median%20was%20%24329%2C000.&text=MEDIAN%20SALES%20PRICE%20OF%20HOMES%20IN%20THE%20U.S.&text=Data%20source%3A%20Federal%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20St.">average price</a> for a house stands at $436,000 per dwelling. The quantity of burned ethereum, valued at $6.1 billion, could have been used to acquire approximately 14,000 homes at this average price. Alternatively, one could delve into the realm of luxury automobiles. With a low-end Lamborghini Huracan priced at $242,000 today, the sum of $6.1 billion would enable the purchase of around 25,206 of these racing machines.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when examining the <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/">expenditure patterns</a> of the U.S. government, data reveals that between October 2021 and April 2022, they were spending nearly $500 billion each month. This striking contrast emphasizes the government&#x2019;s ability to burn through money at a much faster pace than the Ethereum network, as the network of bureaucrats exhausts $6.1 billion in a mere 8.8 hours.</p>

When compared to other prominent networks, Dogecoin has stood out with its substantial volume of processed transactions. Recent statistics reveal an unprecedented milestone reached on May 27, 2023, as the number of DOGE transactions soared to a record-breaking high of more than 2 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin’s Transfer Activity Skyrockets, Hashrate Climbs More Than 38%</h2>
<p>The leading meme coin network, Dogecoin, has been leaving behind network giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the race for daily transaction settlements. While Bitcoin has averaged around 400,000 to 532,000 confirmed transactions per day over the past week, and Ethereum has been processing approximately a million transfers daily, Dogecoin has surpassed them both.</p>
<p>Since May 22, the Dogecoin network has consistently confirmed over a million transactions each day, reaching 1.42 million on May 23. Saturday, May 27 witnessed a milestone for the Dogecoin network as it soared to an all-time high, processing <a href="https://blockchair.com/dogecoin/charts/transaction-count">2,079,070 transactions</a>.</p>

<p>Today, on May 28, 2023, the network shows no signs of slowing down, with the transaction count already surpassing the million mark and continuing to climb. The surge in DOGE transactions can be attributed to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/drc20-tokens-take-dogecoin-community-by-storm-driving-record-breaking-daily-transactions-on-the-network/">introduction of DRC20 tokens</a>, akin to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-blockchain-continues-to-see-growth-in-ordinal-inscriptions-and-brc20-tokens/">BRC20 tokens</a> minted on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>The realm of DRC20 tokens is <a href="https://drc-20.org">expansive</a>, but their current values lack the indexed structure found in BRC20s, making it difficult to figure out the worth of these newfound assets. Presently, DRC20s, also known as Doginals, are primarily <a href="https://twitter.com/Dankoshi420/status/1662606479117934598?s=20">exchanged</a> through over-the-counter (OTC) trades, reminiscent of the early days when Bitcoin-based Ordinal inscriptions were traded before the advent of Ordinal exchange platforms.</p>

<h2 class="sc-gaREgu IYFrL">Gold Prices Poised to Skyrocket as Expert Predicts Fourfold Increase in Demand</h2>
<p>Although gold has been trading below the $2K range since May 16, 2023, Rick Rule, the founder of Rule Investment Media, is confident that the struggling U.S. economy will cause demand for precious metals like gold to skyrocket. In an interview published on May 18, Rule emphasized that people’s anxiety about the purchasing power of conventional savings methods has always been the main factor driving gold prices. According to Rule, this trend is likely to continue, and he predicts that demand for gold will increase by fourfold in the near future.</p>

Described by President Joe Biden as &#x201C;good news for the American people,&#x201D; the deal would open the door to avoiding a historic default by the government in Washington and averting not just a potential economic catastrophe in the United States but a global recession as well.</strong></p>
<h2>Joe Biden, Kevin McCarthy Announce In-Principle Agreement to Raise Debt Ceiling</h2>
<p>After weeks of negotiations, which put an end to a months-long stalemate, the White House and the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives now have &#x201C;an agreement in principle&#x201D; on a deal to raise the debt ceiling in the U.S. for two years and limit budget spending.</p>
<p>The agreement has been reached by President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy during a phone call on Saturday. Both sides are now facing the difficult task to convince the Republican-controlled House and Democrat-dominated Senate to back the deal in Congress before June 5.</p>
<p>On that date, the U.S. government could find itself unable to pay its bills, according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who just <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">updated</a> her projection on Friday. Yellen had previously estimated that the United States could default on its debt obligations as early as June 1.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We have come to an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do but I believe this is an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people,&#x201D; McCarthy told reporters, quoted by CNN. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1662624437399584768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a>, he accused the U.S. head of state that &#x201C;he wasted time and refused to negotiate for months.&#x201D;</p>
<p>President Biden confirmed the deal on Twitter, too. He remarked that the agreement is a compromise that would not make everyone happy but emphasized it &#x201C;is good news for the American people, because it prevents what could have been a catastrophic default and would have led to an economic recession.&#x201D;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Earlier this evening, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a budget agreement in principle.</p>
<p>It is an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone. And, the agreement protects my and&#x2026;</p>
<p>&#x2014; President Biden (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1662639703764484096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Deal to Cap Spending, Postpone Further Ceiling Revisions Until After 2024 Election</h2>
<p>Joe Biden urged both chambers of Congress to &#x201C;pass the agreement right away.&#x201D; Negotiating teams are expected to present the finalized text of the legislation on Sunday and McCarthy said that he will likely speak with the President again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>If approved by lawmakers, with the House vote expected on Wednesday, the agreement would increase the limit for the U.S. government&#x2019;s $31.4 trillion debt through January 2025, postponing future clashes over the ceiling between the Democrats and the Republicans beyond the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>It would also cap spending in the 2024 and 2025 budgets, Reuters reported. And according to a source familiar with the negotiations quoted by CNN, non-defense spending will be capped to the current levels for next year and increased by 1% in the following fiscal year.</p>

<p>In case Biden signs it into law before the approximate default date, Washington would avoid a potentially unprecedented crisis with unpredictable consequences for the world economy as the U.S. government has never before defaulted on its obligations.</p>
<p>The threat of a recession has sparked reactions across the globe. While the credit rating agency Moody&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/moodys-on-de-dollarization-rating-agency-labels-us-debt-default-a-near-term-danger-to-the-dollars-position/">labeled</a> the potential U.S. default a &#x201C;near-term danger to the dollar&#x2019;s position,&#x201D; China&#x2019;s Chengxin International Credit Rating agency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinas-credit-agency-downgrades-us-credit-rating-over-debt-ceiling-standoff-and-looming-default/">downgraded</a> the United States&#x2019; credit rating this week.</p>
<p>Crypto markets reacted positively to the news of the deal reached in the U.S. capital, with the price of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rising by around 2% in 24 hours to over $27,000 at the time of writing and that of ether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), the second-largest crypto by market cap, increasing by nearly 1% to almost $1,850 per coin.</p>

<h2>The Trusted Data Market</h2>
<p>The Cheqd co-founder also told Bitcoin.com News that in today&#8217;s data-driven world, greater emphasis is now being placed on obtaining accurate and verified data. This shift in value from what Edward labeled generic data to trusted data is evidenced by users&#8217; demand for data that is portable and cryptographically verifiable. According to Edward, it is this demand for assured data that has given rise to what is now known as the &#8220;trusted data market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the rest of his responses to questions from Bitcoin.com News, the Cheqd CEO touched on the so-called &#8220;bot paranoia&#8221; and how a decentralized reputation system can be used to combat bots and impersonators. The CEO also offered his thoughts on blockchain-based re-usable KYCs as well as how these can be used in the real world.</p>
<p>Below are Edward&#8217;s answers to questions sent to him via Telegram.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): What is a Trusted Data Market and what problem does it solve for businesses and individuals?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fraser Edward (FE):</strong> In today&#8217;s data-driven world, trust and assurance in data are critical, especially considering the increasing volume of data, the emergence of advanced language models like ChatGPT, and the rising volume of fraud. This shift in value from generic data to &#8220;trusted data&#8221; is characterized by data which is portable, cryptographically verifiable, assured provenance and traceability. Since trusted data has value, recipients will pay the issuers of the data for that value, incentivising them to provide more trusted data wherever possible.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider the example of a Web3 lender looking to attract new users from Web2, and retain existing users in Web3 by lowering collateral ratios on crypto loans: Suppose a borrower approaches a lender, either in the cefi or defi space, seeking a loan. Traditionally, lenders require significant over-collateralization (&gt;140-200%) due to the unknown risk associated with an individual borrower.</p>
<p>In a new scenario, lenders and protocols can offer appropriately collateralized loans if the borrower provides signals that support a perceived reduction of risk. These ‘signals’ are trusted data which may include on-chain transaction history, social signals and proofs like DAO contribution history, ownership of real-world assets, and even the borrower&#8217;s Web2 credit score and KYC data. The lender utilizes these signals to assess the risk of the loan. The more signals the borrower provides, the lower the perceived risk.</p>
<p>This enables lenders to offer competitive loan terms while maintaining their risk profile. Moreover, it enhances the efficiency of capital markets, stimulates growth through new money creation, and establishes cryptocurrencies as a viable alternative to fiat currencies. As the loan is repaid, the lender can provide prompt payment credentials to the borrower, which the borrower can share with other lenders to demonstrate good behaviour. The new lender then compensates the old lender and the borrower for these credentials.</p>
<p>Cheqd supports this data market by ensuring the lender (the verifier of the trusted data) can utilise Cheqd’s payment infrastructure to pay the Issuer of the trusted data (let’s say a consumer credit agency) in a privacy-preserving mechanism. The transaction (the loan) remains trustless, however, the relationship between the borrower and the lender has signals that support trust, enabling a more efficient lending market in crypto whilst retaining what makes crypto lending unique.</p>
<p>Lastly, let&#8217;s explore the application of credentials in the context of DAOs: A DAO commissions an anonymous artist for a specific artwork. The artist successfully completes the work and receives payment from the DAO. The DAO provides the artist with a credential endorsement stating their professionalism, quality work, and timely delivery. The artist can then anonymously share this credential with future projects or DAOs when applying for a job. In this scenario, the new DAO or project may compensate the previous DAO for the recommendation, as it helps de-risk their hiring process. By leveraging trusted data credentials, businesses and organizations can enhance trust and streamline onboarding to speed up work.</p>

<p><strong>BCN: The so-called &#8220;bot paranoia&#8221; often makes users question whether the person they’re talking to in the digital world is really who they claim to be. Can a decentralized reputation system solve that problem for users? If so, how?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FE:</strong> A decentralized reputation is built on various signals that contribute to its credibility. These signals encompass a wide range, including KYC and liveness credentials, social media history (such as account age and posting frequency), and endorsements from other individuals or organizations. Users have the flexibility to combine and selectively share these signals to prove their reputation. While each signal could be manipulated individually, attempting to do so for all signals would be highly challenging and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Moreover, since each recipient of the reputation (i.e., the observer) can prioritize different factors, impersonating someone would require covering all bases, adding significant time and effort to the process. While impersonation remains theoretically possible, the time-consuming nature of such attempts makes it economically unviable. For instance, it would involve maintaining consistent social accounts over the years, demonstrating a regular history, and acquiring endorsements from reputable organizations and people.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Your company is said to be building a marketplace where holders, issuers, and verifiers can exchange and monetize verifiable data. Can you tell our readers who these holders, issuers, and verifiers are as well as how the exchange and monetization of data works?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FE:</strong> Absolutely. One nuance here is that &#8220;holders, issuers, and verifiers/receivers&#8221; are roles and therefore often overlap, especially for organizations. Let&#8217;s consider an example: An investment DAO employs someone to analyze companies and projects for potential funding. The DAO gives the person or people credentials so they can prove who they work for to the companies and projects so they can be trusted and prevent scamming.</p>
<p>In this scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issuer: DAO</li>
<li>Holder: Person</li>
<li>Verifier/receiver: Bank</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, once the DAO has invested, it issues credentials to the company or project so that it can prove they are trustworthy and reputable to other investors or potential business partners without needing to involve the DAO all the time.</p>
<p>In this scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issuer: DAO</li>
<li>Holder: Company or project</li>
<li>Verifier/receiver: Other investors or potential partners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BCN: Much of the world’s data is still stored on Web2 servers. Bringing them to Web3 in a verifiable and privacy-preserving manner could help unlock new use cases or at least improve the existing ones. What are the challenges of bringing verifiable Web2 data such as credit scores to the Web3 ecosystem to facilitate economic activities?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FE:</strong> One of the primary historical hurdles of releasing data to the control of individuals has been the commercial aspect. Traditionally, companies collect, aggregate, and analyze data, generating revenue by selling either aggregate data or insights derived from their analysis. Transitioning to the new data paradigm, where individuals have control over their own data, requires new technologies, which entail costs for businesses. Without a viable revenue stream associated with these changes, commercial feasibility is limited unless mandated by regulations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the key challenge lies in establishing a clear and scalable revenue/commercial model, which is precisely what we at Cheqd are directly addressing. Our focus is on incentivizing the release of data from existing servers and silos back to the control of the individuals to whom it pertains. By solving this challenge, we can unlock new use cases or improve existing ones, facilitating economic activities within the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: The KYC process is sometimes seen as a major stumbling block in the financial services sector. It can be time and resource-consuming and the data can be fraudulent. Do you think a so-called blockchain-based re-usable KYC can solve this problem and potentially improve the user experience?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, re-usable KYC is particularly valuable in Web3, where users are highly mobile and prone to switching between multiple exchanges or marketplaces. For example, the European Commission <a href="https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2666">found</a> 21% of survey respondents had switched providers, i.e. exchanges or marketplaces within the last 5 years, higher than for any other product or service, e.g. current accounts or fiat investment products. It did not ask about switching multiple times within this period or using multiple providers which anecdotally we know most people do.</p>
<p>Currently, many financial service providers outsource their KYC requirements to third-party providers like Onfido, Jumio, or Trulioo, who perform the checks and provide the results. As a result, users often find themselves repeatedly providing their information to the same third-party provider when registering with different financial service providers.</p>
<p>By undergoing the KYC process once and obtaining re-usable credentials, users can utilize those credentials with different service providers multiple times. Implementing such a system would significantly expedite onboarding processes and enhance user satisfaction, particularly when compared to the current approach. It also allows people to use parts of those digital credentials for other purposes, like proving they are over a certain age to buy alcohol, tobacco or lottery tickets for example, without exposing everything in the credential.</p>

<h2>Russian State Duma Chairman Criticizes U.S. Debt Management</h2>
<p>Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of the Russian State Duma, has blasted the U.S. government&#8217;s management of its national debt. On Friday, the head of the lower house of the Russian Federal Assembly criticized the situation of the spiraling debt of the U.S. and how the U.S. government has lifted the debt ceiling more than 100 times in the past.</p>
<p>On his Telegram channel, Volodin <a href="http://duma.gov.ru/en/news/57169/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All financial pyramids, as history shows, sooner or later end in failure. But the current situation is different. The U.S. national debt is a global financial pyramid created by Washington to deceive other nations and people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Volodin explained that the ability of the U.S. government to service its debt was weakening. This made the dollar a risky coin to hold, Volodin remarked, making it a &#8220;toxic&#8221; currency, explaining that several countries were shifting to other currencies for this cause.</p>

<h2>U.S. Debt in Perspective</h2>
<p>According to official numbers, for the year 2023, the U.S. debt was $31.4 trillion, having increased almost $10 trillion during the last five years. A significant yearly increase was produced in 2020 when it rose 19% due to the impact of the different Covid-19 assistance programs.</p>
<p>The increase in this national debt also determines a rise in the interest paid on it. On this, Volodin stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just think about it, in 2023 the sum of interest payments on the U.S. national debt could reach 1.5 trillion USD, and it is almost a third of all US budget revenues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chairman of the State Duma also recommended that the different states of the U.S. federation should seek alternatives to the dollar to reduce the risks for their citizens.</p>
<p>Twenty-three states are discussing laws to approve using gold and silver for payments. In April, Arkansas <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/arkansas-makes-gold-silver-legal-tender-23-states-involved-in-similar-legislation-to-establish-us-dollar-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a law to make gold and silver bullion and coins legal tender, releasing transactions made with these metals from any tax duties. In the same way, Texas is currently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/texas-house-advances-gold-backed-digital-currency-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advancing</a> a bill that would issue a gold-backed digital currency as legal tender.</p>
