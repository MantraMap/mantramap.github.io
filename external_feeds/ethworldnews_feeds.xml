<ul><li>The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority has unveiled new marketing rules for crypto firms.&nbsp;</li><li>First-time crypto investors will get a 24-hour cooling period to prevent impulse buys.&nbsp;</li><li>The FCA’s new rules will classify crypto as restricted mass market investments that require clear risk warnings.&nbsp;</li><li>The new rules will take effect on October 8 and will prevent crypto firms from promoting schemes like &#8220;refer a friend.&#8221;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority has unveiled a series of rules aimed at restricting crypto firms in the country from engaging in certain marketing tactics in the interest of consumer protection. The regulator stated that it would treat crypto as high-risk investments as per the new rules that are set to take effect on October 8, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>New Crypto Investors To Be Restricted From Trading In The First 24 Hours</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-curb-crypto-advertising-with-cooling-off-periods-risk-warnings-2023-06-07/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, as per the Financial Conduct Authority’s new rules, crypto will be classified as restricted mass market investments. The new classification will require crypto advertisements and marketing campaigns to include clear risk warnings. The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uk-wants-btc-crypto-regulated-as-gambling/">UK</a> regulator will also ban marketing promotions such as “refer a friend”, a scheme where crypto users are rewarded for recruiting their friends to the platform to buy crypto. </p>



<p>The FCA’s new rules would also require first-time crypto investors to go through a 24-hour “cooling off” period upon registering trading accounts. The regulator is aiming to discourage impulse crypto purchases by amateur traders through this rule. The new crypto rules are similar to those that are currently imposed by the financial regulator on high-risk investments in traditional finance.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision. Consumers should still be aware that crypto remains largely unregulated and high risk.” </p><cite>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of FCA&#8217;s Consumers and Competition Division</cite></blockquote>



<p>Su Carpenter, the operations director at CryptoUK, stated that her organization agreed with the FCA’s decision to enforce a cooling-off period but questioned the duration. CryptoUK is a self-regulatory trade association for the crypto industry in the United Kingdom. The trade body said that it looked forward to reviewing evidence-based findings on the rationale behind the proposed 24-hour cooling-off period.</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has confirmed that the exchange will not shut down staking services.&nbsp;</li><li>Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal revealed that the company had no plans to delist any tokens named in the SEC’s complaint.&nbsp;</li><li>The SEC initiated enforcement action against the exchange over its staking program and alleged security tokens.&nbsp;</li><li>Grewal previously stated that the lawsuit will have no impact and the exchange will continue to operate as usual.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase’s Chief Executive Officer <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-brian-armstrong-calls-out-sec/">Brian Armstrong</a> has revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against his company will have no impact on its operations. Armstrong confirmed that the largest crypto exchange in the United States will not shut down its staking services, which was one of the products that prompted the enforcement action from the SEC. </p>



<h2><strong>Staking Program Accounts For 3% of Coinbase’s Net Revenue</strong></h2>



<p>Brian Armstrong’s comments came a day after his exchange was sued by the SEC for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. While speaking at the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2023-06-07/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-talks-crypto-regulation-podcast" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a> Invest Conference earlier today, Armstrong revealed that Coinbase would continue offering staking services to its clients. The executive added that the staking program contributed 3% to the company’s overall net revenue. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Even though this complaint came in from the SEC it&#8217;s really business as usual today,  we&#8217;re continuing to trade the assets that we have on our platform. We&#8217;re not going to wind down our staking service. Coinbase&#8217;s staking product is architected and built in a way to be compliant. </p><cite>Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase</cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal told The Block earlier today that the crypto exchange had no plans to delist any of the crypto tokens alleged as securities in the SEC’s lawsuit. Grewal revealed that the exchange was looking at new facts and information to determine if its previous analysis of the concerned tokens may have been incorrect. “We remain confident in our original analysis,” he added.</p>

<ul><li>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has been summoned by the D.C.

<p>Changpeng Zhao, the man at the helm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, has been summoned by the D.C. District Court in relation to the lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The summons comes two days after Zhao and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-files-motion-freeze-binance-us-assets/">Binance</a> were sued by the securities regulator for allegedly breaking securities laws and commingling billions of customers&#8217; funds in a U.S. entity controlled by Zhao.</p>



<h2><strong>Changpeng Zhao Will Not Have To Appear In Person</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/MHUeKyh/show-temp-2-pdf#page=6" rel="nofollow noopener">summons</a> issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Changpeng Zhao has 21 days to respond to the complaint filed by the SEC. The news was shared by Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett on Twitter earlier today. If Zhao fails to respond within 21 days, a default judgment will be entered against him. The court document showed Malta as the Binance CEO’s country of residence. Zhao was born in China but has been a citizen of Canada for decades. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I was told this is just part of the SEC compliant process. Nothing new. No need to FUD” </p><cite>Changpeng Zhao, Founder and CEO of Binance</cite></blockquote>



<p>Changpeng Zhao responded to Terrett’s tweet about the summons served to him and clarified that the court order did not require him to appear in person. Zhao stated that the summons was part of the SEC’s initial complaint and was not new information. He disapproved of the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) associated with the tweet. A subsequent tweet by the Binance CEO stated that Terrett’s tweet was accurate and that the FUD he highlighted was meant for other rumors on crypto Twitter. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Ark Investment Management bought over 400,000 Coinbase shares as COIN prices slumped thanks to an SEC lawsuit.</li><li>Cathie Wood&#8217;s company filled their coffers as the second largest COIN holders with 11.4 million shares amid tensions surrounding the publicly traded crypto exchange.</li><li>Coinbase is being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for selling unregistered securities and running an illegal securities exchange among other allegations.</li><li>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get the job done&#8221; CEO Brian Armstrong said in response to the upcoming legal tussle with the U.S. watchdog.</li></ul>



<p>The investment management firm founded by Cathie Wood, <a href="https://twitter.com/ARKInvest" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/ARKInvest" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ark Invest Management</a>, splurged $21.6 million on Coinbase stock shortly after a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging securities violation by the crypto exchange. </p>



<p>Coinbase rival Binance was also sued by the U.S. SEC with claims of similar but different violations. The Binance suit included its American platform BAM Trading better known as Binance US  and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. </p>



<p>Ark Invest purchased 419,324 shares of Coinbase stock COIN through three of its funds &#8211; ARK&#8217;s Innovation ETF (ARKK), the Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and the Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). The latest buy means Cathie Wood&#8217;s company now owns 11.4 million COIN, the second largest shareholder at press time. </p>



<p>COIN&#8217;s price fell sharply in pre-trading following the news with a decline of over 40%.</p>



<p>The move by Ark Invest to purchase Coinbase stock at a discount is a clear indication of the company&#8217;s long-term bullish outlook on Brian Armstrong&#8217;s crypto exchange and perhaps the broader cryptocurrency industry in America.</p>



<h2>SEC Sues Coinbase And Binance</h2>



<p>On June 5, the SEC <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against Binance for allegedly offering unregistered securities, and the next day, the commission also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> Coinbase on similar grounds. The SEC further alleged that popular cryptocurrencies offered by both platforms such as SOL, ADA, and MATIC qualify as securities.</p>



<p>Both companies have come out to present their pending lawsuits as prime examples of the commission&#8217;s unwillingness to provide registration guidance. Instead, the SEC has opted for brute enforcement actions to &#8220;regulate&#8221; America&#8217;s crypto landscape, crypto proponents insist. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Data from blockchain intelligence startup Nansen showed negative netflow from Coinbase and Binance after the U.S. SEC sued both crypto exchanges.</li><li>Binance and Binance US recorded a combined negative outflow north of $400 million 24 hours after the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against rival Coinbase.</li><li>Coinbase saw a smaller negative netflow across its crypto exchange and custodial service at just over $80 million, excluding withdrawals on Bitcoin&#8217;s network for both platforms.</li></ul>



<p>Data from blockchain intelligence startup <a href="https://pro.nansen.ai/exchange-flows" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://pro.nansen.ai/exchange-flows" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nansen</a> showed negative netflow from crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance after the U.S. SEC sued both platforms for supporting unregistered securities trading. </p>



<p>Binance was the first of the two exchanges on the receiving end of the SEC&#8217;s crackdown this week. Netflow on the company&#8217;s American affiliate Binance US was $78 million positive 24 hours after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued BAM Trading and CEO Changpeng Zhao on June 5. </p>



<p>The numbers flipped negative on June 7, 24 hours after rival crypto exchange Coinbase was accused of similar securities violations. Exchanges experience negative netflow when users withdraw more assets than they deposit.</p>

<h2>Withdrawals Surpass Deposits On Coinbase And Binance</h2>



<p>24 hours after charges were <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed against Coinbase</a>, both Coinbase and Binance show negative netflow according to Nansen. For Binance, negative netflow crossed $400 million on its international platform and Binance US, excluding withdrawals on Bitcoin&#8217;s network. Binance US&#8217;s negative netflow skyrocketed to $120 million after the SEC filed an <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-files-motion-freeze-binance-us-assets/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-files-motion-freeze-binance-us-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emergency motion to free the platform&#8217;s assets</a>.</p>



<p>Coinbase and Coinbase custody saw over $80 million in negative netflow, a smaller number compared to Binance. </p>



<h2>SEC In For  A Showdown</h2>



<p>Both Coinbase and Binance have expressed intent to fight the SEC in court. The two crypto exchanges denied breaking securities laws and called out the commission for failing its duty to provide clear guidance. </p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get the job done&#8221; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in response to the lawsuit and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> &#8220;4&#8221; suggesting that the news is FUD. </p>



<p>The SEC also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-16-coins-securities-binance-coinbase/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-16-coins-securities-binance-coinbase/" rel="noreferrer noopener">classified several cryptos</a> like SOL and MATIC as securities leaving the wider crypto community wondering what other tokens could feature in the commission&#8217;s war against digital currencies. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Circle Internet Singapore was granted a Major Payment Institution license from the country’s Monetary Authority (MAS).</li><li>The license allows USDC’s issuer to provide local and cross-border payments and digital payment token facilities in the city-state.</li><li>Singapore is a springboard for Circle’s international expansion and operations in the greater Asia region, CEO Jeremy Allaire said.</li><li>The stablecoin issuer received provisional approval for DPT operations last year along with crypto trust company Paxos. </li></ul>



<p>USDC issuer Circle received a crypto license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) that will allow the company to <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/circle-singapore-obtained-major-payment-institution-license" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/circle-singapore-obtained-major-payment-institution-license" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">facilitate digital payments within the city-state</a>. </p>



<p>The Major Payment Institution license from the MAS approves Circle to provide users in Singapore with local and cross-border payment infrastructure. Also, the company is now regulated to offer digital payment token services. Approval from DPT services is highly sort after in Singapore and the MAS is notorious for issuing few licenses for this service. </p>



<p>Circle and Paxos initially <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/leading-stablecoin-issuers-paxos-and-circle-secure-regulatory-approvals-to-offer-crypto-services-in-singapore/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/leading-stablecoin-issuers-paxos-and-circle-secure-regulatory-approvals-to-offer-crypto-services-in-singapore/" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> provisional approval as MPIs back in November. </p>



<p>Singapore is a springboard for Circle’s international expansion and operations in the greater Asia region, CEO Jeremy Allaire said. The company could be looking to broaden its services and tap new markets after USDC&#8217;s market cap took a blow during the U.S. bank crisis earlier this year. </p>



<p>USDC&#8217;s market cap hovered peaked at $55 billion in July 2022 before sliding down to around $22 billion in June 2023.</p>



<p>The decision from the MAS also signals a pivot toward digital currency adoption and stablecoin, Allaire suggested. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This milestone signifies a huge step forward for the future of regulated, transparent, and trusted dollar digital currencies in Singapore and the greater Asia region</p></blockquote>



<h2>Circle Shouldering On After USDC Market Slump</h2>



<p>Indeed, the stablecoin issuer has announced a raft of developments after its USDC stablecoin was hammered by banking issues in the U.S. Circle unveiled greater USDC utility within Ethereum and Avalanche&#8217;s ecosystem with the launch of its  Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Market maker Cumberland withdrew nearly 25,000 ETH from Binance and Coinbase.</li><li>The market maker seems to have bought the dip after crypto prices slumped on the back of SEC lawsuits.</li><li>Binance and Coinbase are accused of operating unregistered security exchanges in violation of U.S. laws.</li><li>Both platforms deny the allegations and say the SEC would rather regulate through enforcement action than create a clear rule book for crypto registration.</li></ul>



<p>Market maker Cumberland withdrew around $46 million in Ether (ETH) from Binance and Coinbase following enforcement actions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchanges. </p>



<p>Cumberland deposited $85 million and $3.5 million in Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin into Coinbase and Binance respectively after the SEC sued Binance, <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1666356861845782529?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1666356861845782529?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LookOnChain</a> reports said. It seems the market maker deployed capital toward ETH buys on the crypto exchange. </p>



<p>On June 7, Cumberland withdrew a combined 24,850 ETH from Binance and Coinbase. The market maker also withdrew other cryptocurrencies like AAVE, COMP, LINK, and SHIB. Cumberland halted trading and market-making for FireCoin possibly due to concerns that the token is an unregistered security named by the SEC. </p>



<p>Blockchain Intelligence company Nansen tracked 23 million in BUSD withdrawals by Cumberland. The company sent the funds to crypto trust company Paxos most likely for redemptions. Notably, Paxos was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-binance-stablecoin-paxos-busd/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-binance-stablecoin-paxos-busd/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered</a> to stop minting the Binance-branded stablecoin by the SEC and New York&#8217;s Department of Finance Services (NYDFS). </p>



<h2>Companies Capitalize On Panic Surrounding Binance And Coinbase</h2>



<p>Other institutions moved to capitalize on panic in the market after the SEC unleashed securities lawsuits against crypto exchanges <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>. LookOnChain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1665977590233038848?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1665977590233038848?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that FBG capital sent $44 million in Tether&#8217;s USDT to Binance after news of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit broke. </p>



<p>One &#8220;Smart Money&#8221; wallet withdrew over 8,000 ETH. The wallet deposited $15.9 million in USDT, buying ETH tokens at an average price of $1,808 according to LookOnChain. </p>



<p>LookOnChain again reported $3.35 million worth of ETH buys from a whale wallet after withdrawals in USDC and USDT from lending protocol Aave.</p>



<p>Indeed, ETH prices and token prices across the broader crypto market fell as news of the SEC&#8217;s suit against Binance and Coinbase broke. Prices are seemingly recovering at press time and ETH was up 3% on Wednesday. </p>

<ul><li>The United States SEC has filed a motion to freeze the assets of Binance US.&nbsp;</li><li>The securities regulator is seeking a temporary restraining order from the D.C. District Court.</li><li>The SEC is also seeking a show cause order as to why a preliminary injunction should not be granted.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed an emergency motion in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of Binance US. The filing comes just a day after the securities regulator <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-vigorously-litigate-sec/">sued</a> the American arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange and its founder Changpeng Zhao for operating an unregistered securities exchange and misrepresenting trading controls and oversight, among eleven other charges. </p>



<h2><strong>SEC Asks Court To Issue Show Cause Order To Binance US</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.4.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made with the D.C. District Court, the SEC is seeking an order to freeze the assets of BAM Management and BAM Trading, the entities overseeing Binance and its affiliates. The emergency motion filed by the securities regulator also sought an order to show cause “why a preliminary injunction should not be granted”. The SEC sought six other court orders, including one requiring the sworn accounting of “certain assets” from Binance US. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The SEC respectfully submits that this relief is necessary on an expedited basis to ensure the safety of customer assets and prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment, given the Defendants’ years of violative conduct, disregard of the laws of the United States, evasion of regulatory oversight, and open questions about various financial transfers and the custody and control of Customer Assets”</p><cite>SEC’s filing in the D.C. District Court</cite></blockquote>



<p>If granted, the order would give Binance five days to make sure that the entity to have access to the exchange’s customer funds is Binance US. Within 30 days of granting the order, all customer funds would have to be transferred to new wallets. In its initial complaint against the crypto giant, the SEC indicated that it would seek the above-mentioned restraining order.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As of ~5:30pm CET on June 6th, one day after the SEC announced it was filing charges against Binance entities and Binance CEO CZ, net daily outflows from Binance’s on-chain wallets amounted -1.36bn USD or 2.5% of the USD 54bn balance attributed to Binance on-chain.</p><cite>&#8211; <strong>Nansen analysts Aurelie Barthere and Philip Grushyn</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> of breaking securities law and offering unregistered assets but its CEO Brian Armstrong was exempt from allegations. </p>



<p>In total, 16 cryptocurrencies &#8211; BNB, BUSD, SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, MANA, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, NEXO, ATOM, And COTI &#8211; were classified as unregistered securities. </p>



<p>These tokens boast a combined market cap north of $100 billion at press time. BNB, ADA, SOL, and MATIC each rank in the top 10 cryptocurrencies per CoinMarketCap rankings. While MATIC &#8211; the native asset of Ethereum scaling solution Polygon &#8211; was classified as a security, ETH was not leaving room for speculation as to why. </p>



<h2>SEC Gary Gensler &#8211; US Doesnt Need More Digital Currencies</h2>



<p>Chair Gary Gensler dodged answering &#8220;Yes or No&#8221; when asked by Congress whether ETH counts as security or not. While Gensler&#8217;s clear answer on the matter remains unknown, the commission chair made it clear that the U.S. does not need more digital currencies. </p>



<p>Gensler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxXdUvMqAc" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxXdUvMqAc" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">questioned</a> the underlying value of &#8220;these crypto tokens&#8221; and argued that American investors already have access to digital currencies in the Dollar. </p>



<p>Chair Gensler added that crypto businesses must come in and register in compliance with existing law issued by Congress to protect U.S. investors. Crypto entities have insisted that the commission does not provide a clear path for businesses that intend on registering. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>2. There is no path to &#8220;come in and register&#8221; &#8211; we tried, repeatedly &#8211; so we don&#8217;t list securities. We reject the vast majority of assets we review.</p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1666129111025324035" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1666129111025324035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&#8211; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong after today&#8217;s lawsuit</a></cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has highlighted the SEC’s harmful regulation by enforcement approach in light of the recent lawsuit.&nbsp;</li><li>Armstrong reminded everyone that the SEC reviewed his company before allowing it to go public in 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>Ripple executives also spoke in support of Coinbase and called out the SEC for its hostile stance on crypto.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Brian Armstrong, the Chief Executive Officer of Coinbase Global Inc, has responded to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-cease-desist-order-sec-lawsuit/">lawsuit</a> filed earlier today. The SEC’s complaint charged the largest crypto exchange in the United States for operating as a registered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency and violating securities laws.</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase CEO: Proud To Represent Crypto Industry In Court For Clarity</strong></h2>



<p>Brian Armstrong took to <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1666129111025324035" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> to call out the SEC for resorting to litigation instead of guiding his crypto exchange and similar entities toward regulatory compliance by engaging in rulemaking for the broader crypto industry. Armstrong told his followers that his company is proud to represent the industry in court in pursuit of clarity surrounding rules for the crypto space. The Coinbase executive also reminded everyone that the securities regulator had reviewed the company’s business before allowing it to go public in 2021. </p>



<p>Responding to SEC Chair <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gary-gensler-us-no-more-digital-currency/">Gary Gensler</a>’s call for crypto firms to “come in and register”, Brian Armstrong clarified that there was no path for firms such as his to get registered with the regulator under the current regulatory regime. He also highlighted the contradicting statements made by the SEC and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over the difference between a security and a commodity. Armstrong cited the recent events to underscore the need for new legislation from the US Congress to support crypto by putting clear rules in place. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Instead of publishing a clear rule book, the SEC has taken a regulation-by-enforcement approach that is harming America. So if we need to avail ourselves of the courts to get clarity, so be it.”</p><cite>Brian Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer at Coinbase</cite></blockquote>



<p>Speaking on the matter, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal stated that the SEC’s enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry was hurting America’s economic competitiveness. Grewal added that the lawsuit would not affect the exchange operations and that it will continue to operate as usual. <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1666126928678469632" rel="nofollow noopener">Tweeting</a> in support of Coinbase, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called out SEC Chair Gary Gensler for his “laughable pro-innovation stance” on crypto. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty added that despite what Chair Gensler may purport, the SEC didn’t have the regulatory authority to label tokens as securities. </p>
