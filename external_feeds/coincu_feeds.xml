<p>Hong Kong legislator Wu Jiezhuang&#8217;s recent statement regarding the talent gap in Hong Kong&#8217;s Web3 industry has brought attention to the limited availability of individuals possessing the necessary skills to contribute to the industry&#8217;s growth. According to Jiezhuang, the talent gap is reported to be between 50,000 to 100,000 people, with a scarcity of individuals who possess an international perspective and are familiar with the laws and regulations surrounding Web3.</p>

<p>Jiezhuang, who is also a founding member of G-Rocket, a startup accelerator, intends to attract 1,000 Web3 businesses to Hong Kong over the next three years. Already, more than 400 companies have registered on the platform, and 100 have landed in Hong Kong. With the 10% goal already achieved in just four months, Jiezhuang estimates that the 1,000 Web3 companies goal may be completed by the end of next year.</p>

<p>In related news, Jiezhuang reported that Hong Kong welcomes global crypto exchanges such as Coinbase to apply for compliance exchanges and discuss stock listing plans. He expressed his willingness to provide assistance, citing OKX and Huobi compliance entities&#8217; previous listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The Web3 industry&#8217;s growth and development are crucial to the future of cryptocurrency, and it is vital to address the talent gap issue. Jiezhuang&#8217;s incubation plan is a step in the right direction, and with the platform already attracting hundreds of companies, it is clear that there is a demand for such initiatives. With Jiezhuang&#8217;s invitation to global crypto exchanges and his commitment to providing assistance, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a hub for Web3 innovation.</p>

<p>The reason for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) action is still unclear. But the SEC is<a href="https://news.coincu.com/193952-sec-lawsuit-shocks-crypto-market-plummet-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> suing</a> Coinbase and Binance because they believe many cryptocurrencies traded on those exchanges are securities that must be registered with the US regulator. There is one big exception: bitcoin.</p>



<p>That belief encourages investors to stick with the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency despite industry turmoil caused by new lawsuits SEC against the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchanges and the United States. Although there is no law that states whether bitcoin is a security, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler as well as former Chairman Jay Clayton have indicated in numerous public comments that they do not believe bitcoin is a security. Instead, most investors interpret it as a commodity like gold or wheat.</p>



<p>The technology white paper of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has been around since the end of 2008 when the founder of this coin sent this text to many email addresses in the crypto community.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that this founder did not reveal his true identity but took the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. This nickname has followed the Bitcoin coin to this day, and no one has been able to confirm the exact identity of this mysterious founder.</p>

<p>On January 3, 2009, Satoshi founded the Bitcoin network and was the first to mine the first Bitcoin block on this distributed network. There are many theories, but many of them share the same opinion that the sudden appearance of a character like Satoshi will adversely affect the cryptocurrency market as well as their own safety. </p>



<p>Over the years, Satoshi&#8217;s true identity has been a hot topic, with many names coming up. This is not surprising. Everyone loves mysteries. For others, they are more interested in the huge amount of Bitcoin that Satoshi is holding. Will there be a day when this character suddenly appears, and Bitcoins flood the market, affecting the price of this cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Another theory is that Nakatomo knew the authorities would go after the creator of Bitcoin if he revealed his identity. Bitcoin is the most successful cryptocurrency, but it is far from what the moderators want as an alternative to currency. Nakatomo knows for sure Bitcoin attracts many forces that are not in favor. Governments certainly don&#8217;t like threats to their monetary policy.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong hopes for changes in U.S. crypto regulatory policies after the 2024 U.S. election.</em></li>



<li><em>The Republican Party&#8217;s friendliness to cryptocurrencies is a positive sign for Coinbase&#8217;s future in the US market.</em></li>



<li><em>Non-transaction fees account for 50% of Coinbase&#8217;s revenue, emphasizing the importance of regulatory clarity for the company&#8217;s continued success.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong discusses the SEC lawsuit and Coinbase&#8217;s goal to get clarity for the cryptocurrency industry. Armstrong emphasizes that Coinbase distinguishes between securities and commodities.</strong></h5>



<p>The legal dispute centers on whether certain cryptocurrencies listed on Coinbase&#8217;s platform are securities or commodities. The SEC alleges that Coinbase broke the rules by listing tokens that the regulator claims are securities, while Coinbase maintains that it has followed the law and that the tokens in question are commodities. Coinbase has been formally petitioning the SEC for regulatory clarity, as the lack of clarity is a major issue in the US. Every startup in the crypto space spends significant amounts of money on lawyers who tell them that there is no case law and they cannot give a clear answer.</p>

<p>Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjLGyWsgbTA" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjLGyWsgbTA" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wall Street Journal </a>to discuss the situation. Armstrong emphasized that Coinbase has a committee responsible for reviewing coin listings and distinguishing whether they are securities or commodities. He added that Coinbase had shared this internal framework with the SEC. Despite this, the SEC has sued Coinbase, alleging that the company broke the rules by listing tokens the regulator claims are securities.</p>



<p>Armstrong stated that Coinbase has long had a tense relationship with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, but the company does not have a problem cooperating with other regulators. He also noted that the company&#8217;s revenue comes mainly from transaction fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum, with non-transaction fees accounting for 50% of the revenue. Coinbase has had a tense relationship with the SEC for some time, and the company&#8217;s decision to push ahead on adding tokens despite the risk has been hanging over the industry.</p>



<p>Additionally, Armstrong said that Coinbase had reviewed over a thousand assets, rejecting 90% of them and listing only those that the company felt had a strong argument that they were commodities. Coinbase has acquired a broker-dealer license, which is still dormant because the SEC has not allowed the company to activate it. Coinbase&#8217;s goal with the court case is to get clarity for the industry, not just for the company but for the entire cryptocurrency industry and America as a nation.</p>

<p>The lack of clarity in the regulatory environment has been an ongoing issue for the cryptocurrency industry. The US needs to catch up with other countries like the UK, Singapore, and Hong Kong, which have clear rules and comprehensive crypto legislation. The lack of clarity has made it difficult for businesses to operate in the US and has hindered innovation in the sector. Coinbase&#8217;s legal battle with the SEC could result in greater regulatory clarity and help to unblock the issue.</p>



<p>The CEO said he looks forward to changes in U.S. crypto regulatory policies after the 2024 U.S. election. The Republican Party is friendly to cryptocurrencies. Coinbase will not abandon the US market.</p>

<p>Recently, the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, tweeted that the company&#8217;s net outflow was approximately $392 million in the last 24 hours. However, he clarified that this number is not necessarily an indication of a decrease in assets under management (AUM) due to crypto price drops. In fact, some 3rd party analytics measure change in AUM in USD equivalent as outflow, which can be misleading. Additionally, some only measure outflow, not inflows, which can skew the data.</p>



<p>On days with sharp price movements, such as today, many arbitrage traders move a lot of funds between exchanges, which can result in significantly more outflows than on normal days. For reference, Binance processed $7 billion in net outflows in one day last November.</p>



<p>According to Spot On Chain, some reports only capture a short time frame, like a few days or a week, and give a quick conclusion that there is a sharp increase in Binance outflow. However, this is different from the bigger picture. As seen in the graph below, the exchange balance of Binance is on an increasing trend and is significantly higher compared to December 2022.</p>

<p>In addition, Wu Blockchain reported that the BNB/USDC trading pair BNB price on Binance briefly dropped to 57 USDC before quickly returning, indicating poor trading depth for that pair. Similar situations have occurred with other trading pairs on Binance before.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BVM) is showing how Bitcoin can transform from a simple transactional cryptocurrency to a powerful blockchain network.</em></li>



<li><em>To explore the potential of implementing smart contracts within the simplicity and security of Bitcoin, MVC (MicroVision Chain) was born.</em></li>



<li><em>In the coming new era, BVM shows great potential, proving that Bitcoin can be programmed through code and is capable of running smart contracts.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin (BTC) is commonly regarded as the biggest and most secure blockchain in the cryptocurrency industry. Contrary to common opinion, Bitcoin has always had complete smart contracting functionality.</strong> <strong>Its security is enhanced by the unique proof-of-work (PoW) consensus process, and the simplicity of its architecture makes Bitcoin very simple to comprehend and use.</strong></h5>

<p>However, as the Bitcoin ecosystem expands and its demands develop, the need for increasingly complicated functionality, such as smart contracts, emerges. For a long time, smart contract applications were mostly focused on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, but with the introduction of the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BVM), this is progressively changing.</p>



<p>A smart contract is a contract that automatically enforces its terms, which are put in code into the blockchain. Smart contracts enable the development of increasingly complicated decentralized apps (dApps) on the blockchain. Although blockchain systems such as Ethereum currently allow smart contracts, Bitcoin is not intended to handle this feature directly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is a Virtual Machine?</h2>



<p>A virtual machine (VM) is a program that emulates a computer system. It has a virtual CPU, memory, and storage and appears, from the outside, to be no different than a physical machine with the same hardware.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is the function of a Virtual Machine?</h2>



<p>An operating system, data, and programs are all part of a virtual computer. It functions just like a real computer; it can host webpages, execute applications, and connect to other computers on a network. When seen on a screen, the virtual machine appears as a window running inside the operating system of that computer.</p>



<p>It also contains a CPU, memory, and storage, but they are all virtual rather than real. As a result, numerous virtual machines may live on a single server. When this occurs, the server manages them using a piece of software known as a hypervisor. The hypervisor links the virtual hardware of the VM with the actual components of the server.</p>



<p>In this scenario, a single physical server may host two, three, four, or even ten virtual machines. Nevertheless, the number is restricted by the server&#8217;s resources; too many VMs would result in poor performance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Bitcoin Virtual Machine (BVM)?</h2>



<p>A blockchain project dubbed MVC (MicroVision Chain) was created to investigate the feasibility of incorporating smart contracts inside the simplicity and security of Bitcoin. MVC is a blockchain based on the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) concept that employs the same proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism as Bitcoin.</p>



<p>MVC, on the other hand, presents a smart contract paradigm called BVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine), which intends to improve the capability of Bitcoin-based smart contracts. BVM has immense promise in the approaching new age, demonstrating that Bitcoin can be programmed via code and can execute smart contracts.</p>



<p>The following are some of the primary benefits of BVM:</p>



<ul>
<li>Simple to maintain: Since the contract in BVM is deterministic, the output is fully dependent on the input and does not depend on or affect the external state. This improves the code&#8217;s readability and maintainability by making it more intelligible and predictable.</li>



<li>Since BVM has no global state, the state safety issue in parallel computing is successfully overcome. BVM&#8217;s architecture allows it to handle large-scale contract computations, demonstrating better performance scalability effectively.</li>



<li>Ease of testing and debugging: Since BVM uses functional programming, the testing process is simplified. Since the contract is deterministic, developers only need to concentrate on the input and output, simplifying debugging and avoiding any difficulties caused by external state concerns.</li>



<li>BVM&#8217;s functional programming paradigm supports the creation of concise, well-structured code. Moreover, functional programming makes it easier to write resilient code by allowing for immutability and stateless functions. This significantly decreases issues caused by state changes, making the code more predictable, trustworthy, and easy to debug.</li>



<li>Code simplicity and compactness: BVM&#8217;s stack-based approach enables the creation of simpler and more compact code. Its simplicity minimizes code size while also allowing for more effective use of memory and bandwidth. Also, simpler code has a reduced error rate, which enhances code dependability, which is very important in the smart contract situation.</li>
</ul>



<p>The purpose of BVM&#8217;s design is to combine the benefits of Bitcoin with the flexibility of smart contracts to accomplish the goal of growing more complicated functionalities in the Bitcoin network. BVM is Bitcoin-compatible and depends on Bitcoin&#8217;s fundamental technology, building on this foundation to enable smart contract features that Bitcoin does not support in its original form.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Effective Bitcoin scaling solution</h2>



<p>The success of many tracks within the Bitcoin ecosystem has been really spectacular this year. The Ordinals protocol has provided the Bitcoin ecosystem with unparalleled exposure and liquidity, while new standards such as BRC-20 and SRC-20 have spurred repeated waves of market enthusiasm. Yet, Bitcoin network congestion and excessive transaction fees have suddenly emerged as heated themes. The area of smart contracts and DeFi has had little attention in the past due to the unique nature of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, has pioneered the BVM idea, integrating Bitcoin smart contracts into a new narrative.</p>



<p>MVC is recognized as the finest Bitcoin expansion isomorphic chain. It shares Bitcoin&#8217;s core UTXO structure, consensus method, total amount, etc. As a result, it may build a one-to-one mapping connection with every Satoshi of BTC and become some degree of parallel world-like sidechains of BTC.</p>



<p>MVC features the industry&#8217;s first Turing-complete smart contract based on Bitcoin UTXO, and it has reached ultra-high performance on the test network over 1w TPS. Its ecosystem presently has over 20 apps accessible, 1w+ active addresses, and is set to unleash the future of creating enormous applications on Bitcoin and transporting hundreds of millions of people.</p>



<p>It should be noted that MVC and BVM are not designed to replace Bitcoin but to function as side chains to Bitcoin&#8217;s current architecture, allowing for the indefinite development of the Bitcoin blockchain. By isolating these experimental features from the core Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin&#8217;s simplicity and security can be maintained while its potential variety of uses is expanded.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>MVC is developing a BVM capable of executing analogous activities inside the Bitcoin network, similar to how the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) functions and executes smart contracts within the Ethereum network. A BVM&#8217;s potential might substantially transform the environment, establishing Bitcoin as a strong participant in decentralized applications.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Bitcoin offers immense potential for scaling applications, owing to its unique simplicity and security. As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, initiatives such as MVC develop, providing innovations and fresh concepts that have significantly supported Bitcoin&#8217;s integrity. </p>



<p>MVC&#8217;s BVM demonstrates that Bitcoin is likely to integrate smart contract features comparable to platforms like Ethereum, which will definitely enrich and diversify the cryptocurrency ecosystem. We are certain that with further investigation and practice, we will see a more diversified and vibrant blockchain future.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is about to undergo a huge shift. Ordinals, the planned BRC-20 standard, smart contracts, and the creation of a Bitcoin Virtual Machine all point to a future in which Bitcoin evolves from a basic transactional cryptocurrency to a powerful, multifunctional blockchain network capable of supporting a range of decentralized applications. Bitcoin is in an exciting period, and progress in the next years is widely awaited.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>GBRC721 is a novel Bitcoin Ordinals standard that was created to facilitate the introduction of Non-Fungible Ordinals collections.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite being a very modest collection, the initial demo collection, OrdiBots, succeeded in decreasing total inscription costs by 55%.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The obvious effect of the growing number of inscriptions is that the Bitcoin network cost has risen and stabilized at a higher level, and more authors are joining the Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem, boosting the community&#8217;s desire for Bitcoin. As a result, developers continue to introduce new protocols or standards to alleviate or improve present pain points. GBRC721 (Generative BRC-721) is one of the most eye-catching. Coincu will provide you with a full overview of the <a href="https://github.com/jerryfane/generative-brc-721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GBRC721</a> protocol and its ecological initiatives.</strong></h5>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is GBRC721?</h2>



<p>The protocol&#8217;s full name is Generative BRC-721, and its creator is Jerry (Twitter handle @0xJerry543). Jerry also founded the Bitcoin NFT project DogePunks.</p>



<p>The GBRC72 standard is a way to optimize block space use in the Bitcoin ordinals ecosystem, allowing more producers can participate and encouraging innovation. A &#8220;deploy&#8221; procedure is used in the standard to establish a GBRC72 collection with unique qualities kept on-chain. The attributes from the deployment process are then referenced by a &#8220;mint&#8221; operation, which yields Non-Fungible Ordinals. </p>



<p>This method reduces block space utilization by 50% to 90%. The proposed standard&#8217;s effect was illustrated in a case study using a GBRC72 collection dubbed &#8220;OrdiBots,&#8221; which showed a 55% decrease in block area. Front-ends must adjust in order to produce and show pictures based on the text data from the mint inscription. This proposed standard sets the framework for efficient, decentralized Bitcoin blockchain innovation.</p>



<p>With increased popularity and availability to additional platforms, the GBRC721 protocol&#8217;s front-end interface shows real pictures created by the cast inscriptions rather than text data. This is now possible by scanning the user text inscription&#8217;s &#8220;gen-brc-721&#8221; inscription. The picture may then be rebuilt utilizing on-chain data and saved inside its system architecture in the same manner as is common today.</p>



<p>The total number of minted inscriptions on the Bitcoin NFT protocol Ordinals hit 11,360,287 pieces, according to <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune</a> statistics, and the cumulative fee revenue reached 1,688.1928 BTC, worth $44,705,391. In less than two months after software programmer Casey Rodarmor established the NFT protocol &#8220;Ordinals&#8221; on January 30 and formally deployed it on the Bitcoin mainnet, the number of inscriptions produced on the Bitcoin chain has surpassed 1 million. It can be shown that ecological growth based on the Ordinals protocol is rapid and growing in scope.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The implementation process of GBRC721</h2>



<p>This protocol&#8217;s deployment and inscription procedures are similar to those of BRC-20 tokens. The procedure consists of three major operations:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create and produce a BRC721 collection using the deployment process. The deployment procedure aims to create a JSON/Text inscription that comprises the collection&#8217;s general information and composition. The collection attributes&#8217; Base64 encoded data. It is also possible to establish numerous deployment inscriptions for the same collection, each storing a unique set of attributes.</li>



<li>Create an irreplaceable serial number using JSON or text inscriptions.</li>



<li>Convert irregular ordinals to normal serial number inscriptions.</li>
</ul>



<p>The distinction is that each of its collections is distinct, but it cannot be reviewed before the block is confirmed, resulting in a collection that may be burnt by a large number of individuals, forcing users to incur charges but get nothing.</p>



<p>Based on this, Jerry said that he is contemplating whitelisting the chain in order to better improve the community experience and assure equitable distribution. This will need the addition of a new key to the deployment inscription that will refer to a second inscription holding the whitelist information for claiming NFTs. This will offer a more controllable and equitable distribution approach for GBRC721 collects, reducing injustice due to technical and other factors. </p>



<p>Adopting the GBRC72 standard will improve the efficiency with which Bitcoin block space is used. Since the pictures for the unique qualities are only inscribed once in the deployment transaction, the assets consist of a text file mentioning these traits. The image may then be recreated using the on-chain deploy inscription, and the results verified using the SHA256 output.</p>



<p>Example of a mint operation inscription Ordi.io:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
   "p":"gen-brc-721",
   "op":"mint",
   "s":"ordibots",
   "t_ins":&#091;
      "b7205d40f3b1b1486567f0d6e53ff2812983db4c03ad7d3606812cd150c64802i0"
   ],
   "h":"aa0d33b748e0177528a910a56a61c47bee2ba9b69749228d6520049c0fea3f4f",
   "id":"554",
   "a":&#091;
      &#091;0,"bitcoin-orange"],
      &#091;0,"rainbow"],
      &#091;0,"black-and-white-triangular"],
      &#091;0,"square"],
      &#091;0,"happy"]
   ]
}
</code></pre>



<p>According to <a href="https://dune.com/j543/generative-brc-721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune</a> statistics, the GBRC721 ecosystem presently has over 22,000 transactions totaling 3.24 BTC, and its ecosystem initiatives are developing one after the other. The next sections will present the most common initiatives in its environment. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">OrdiBots</h2>



<p>Jerry built a demo Generative BRC-721 collection named OrdiBots to show the application of this proposed standard. The new standard resulted in a 55% decrease in block size for this collection of 1,000 ordinals constituted of 26 separate qualities. This discovery suggests the possibility of even better efficiency with increasingly complicated trait collections.</p>



<p>The cumulative size of the 1,000 photos is around 663kb. Given the current network charge of roughly 30 sats/vB, the total cost to inscribe the collection is around 0.293BTC ($7,850 at current pricing). Jerry may decrease the size of the whole collection to 294kb (10kb + 284kb) by adopting the GBRC72 standard, resulting in a total projected savings of around 55% of block space. Since OrdiBots is already a fairly light collection, this may be regarded as a lower barrier, and Jerry can anticipate higher efficiency with a collection created with more complicated features.</p>



<p>OrdiBots was inscribed on May 22-23 because, being the first initiative under the GBRC721 innovation criteria, it received enough attention and support from the outset.</p>



<p>At the time, OrdiBots was engraved for about $3. With the market&#8217;s constant attention, its floor price grew to a high of 0.12 BTC, which is today comparable to $3,200, a 1,000-fold rise. According to ordinalswallet&#8217;s market statistics, the maximum selling price of its golden bundle is 0.175 BTC.</p>



<p>Yet, it remains to be seen if OrdiBots based on the new standard will be able to push the development area to the next level.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="815" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753-1024x815.png" alt="GBRC72: Promoting Innovation On Bitcoin Blockchain" class="wp-image-193957" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753-1024x815.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753-300x239.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753-768x611.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753-1536x1222.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753-750x597.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753-1140x907.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-753.png 1861w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="GBRC72: Promoting Innovation On Bitcoin Blockchain 26"></a></figure></div>


<p>Moreover, it is not difficult to discover that OrdiBots can attain such a large multiple rise to its innovation-based criteria, which is detachable from the strong consensus of its community members. It has received a lot of attention by auctioning off gold equipment every day and giving the earnings to the community. Simultaneously, community members have built tools such as rarity inquiry and position rating on their own and have actively participated with the platform and other projects in the ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>GBRC721 has received a lot of attention because of its first ecological project, OrdiBots, which has a very high growth multiple. Nonetheless, the existing ecological infrastructure must be steadily enhanced.</p>



<p>If this standard is adopted by a large number of collections and authors, front-end interfaces will need to be modified to show the actual picture created by the mint inscription rather than the text data.</p>



<p>Of course, there are many users in the community who are skeptical of operating application development projects on Bitcoin, and there are plenty of observers who are dismissive of the present scenario. Nevertheless, the present Web3 circle or money circle is still in the idea and story-telling stage. During the previous cycle, the market mostly reported news about DeFi, DAO, GameFi, and other EVM chain ecosystem players. The Ordinals agreement has opened up a fresh avenue for the existing market limitations.</p>

<p>Specifically, Cumberland deposited 9 million MATIC, worth over $6.3 million, to Binance and 5 million MATIC, worth $3.5 million, to Coinbase. A crypto wallet related to Cumberland, Jump Trading and Robinhood also deposited a cumulative 9.4 million to crypto exchanges. This information was shared on Twitter by Lookonchain, an analytics firm, in multiple tweets on Saturday.</p>

<p>These deposits were made just before a nearly 30% drop in Polygon tokens, which were likely sold on crypto exchanges amid an illiquid environment. This contributed to a sudden price decline in not only Polygon tokens, but also cardano (ADA) and solana (SOL) tokens, which fell as much as 25% in the past 24 hours. It is important for investors to be aware of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and to exercise caution when making investment decisions.</p>

<p>The tokens were likely impacted after being alleged as securities in multiple U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase earlier this week. This highlights the increasing scrutiny and regulation of cryptocurrencies by government bodies. As such, investors should stay informed about developments in the regulatory landscape and take appropriate measures to mitigate risks.</p>

<p>The sudden movement of millions of dollars worth of MATIC tokens by key market makers contributed to a sharp decline in MATIC tokens, as well as other cryptocurrencies. This news underscores the importance of being vigilant and informed when investing in cryptocurrencies, especially given the current regulatory environment. Investors should exercise caution and do their own research before making any investment decisions.</p>

<p>This slide is likely due to a risk-off event that followed the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, in which 13 tokens were alleged as securities. This news has rocked the crypto world, with many questioning the future of these tokens in light of the lawsuit.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the bulk of the losses occurred in the early hours of Saturday, with Solana (SOL), polygon (MATIC), and cardano (ADA) falling as much as 25% within hours. This sudden drop has led some to speculate that a major crypto fund may have sold their holdings in these tokens, taking advantage of the illiquid market conditions.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The impact of this news has been far-reaching, with weekly declines for these tokens reaching as much as 34%. Even major tokens such as bnb (BNB), dogecoin (DOGE), and xrp (XRP) have not been spared, falling over 11%. In fact, the top two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), have also been impacted, with BTC dropping 3.6% and ETH sliding 4.5%.</p>



<p>As if this was not enough, we have also seen nearly $300 million in liquidations in the crypto-tracked futures market in the early hours of Saturday, according to data from Coinglass. </p>

<p>This figure exceeds the record liquidation figures from earlier this week. For those who may not be familiar with the term, liquidation refers to the process of forcibly closing a trader&#8217;s positions in the cryptocurrency market. It occurs when a trader&#8217;s margin account can no longer support their open positions due to significant losses or a lack of sufficient margin to meet the maintenance requirements.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CZ clarified that Binance&#8217;s fiat and stablecoin reserves, which are primarily used for short-term salaries and expenses, have indeed decreased. </strong></h5>

<p>However, he emphasized that the exchange&#8217;s crypto reserves have actually increased over the past months, weeks, and days.</p>

<p>The market&#8217;s ups and downs are often subject to diverse interpretations, but the truth is that no single reason can be pinpointed as the sole driver. Numerous buyers and sellers participate in the market, each with their own motivations and strategies. Therefore, it is important to approach such narratives with caution.</p>

<p>Another narrative that has emerged is the notion that the $1.3 billion worth of altcoins on Robinhood could be a contributing factor to the market decline. However, CZ admitted that he has no insights on this particular matter, suggesting that others may possess more information in that regard.</p>

<p>Various narratives linking the market fluctuations to actions taken by regulatory bodies, such as the US or China banning or un-banning certain activities, have also surfaced. However, the complexity of market dynamics makes it challenging to attribute the price movements solely to these factors.</p>



<p>CZ advises investors to manage two critical emotions: greed and fear. These emotions often drive impulsive decision-making and can lead to significant financial losses. Instead, he encourages individuals to focus on risk management and maintain a &#8220;SAFU&#8221; (Secure Asset Fund for Users) approach to their investments.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Monday, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed 13 accusations against Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, as well as its wealthy co-founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ. That is the latest in a series of moves launched against cryptocurrency firms.</strong></h5>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">CZ runs money-laundering companies</h2>



<p>The SEC detailed the details of Binance and CZ&#8217;s violations in the 136-page lawsuit filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, including operating an illegal trading platform in the United States; operating an unregistered exchange, broker-dealer, and Clearinghouses; misappropriation of client funds; unregistered securities offerings and sales, and more.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Through thirteen charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law. They attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes so they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms,&#8221; SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The SEC accused CZ and the exchange, like previous Binance rival FTX and its creator Sam Bankman-Fried, of exerting control over client funds, enabling them to mix or transfer customer assets at whim, including transfers to CZ&#8217;s ownership and control. Sigma Chain is a being.</p>



<p>BAM Trading and BAM Management US Holdings, Inc. (BAM Management) are also accused of deceiving investors about non-existent trading restrictions on the Binance.US platform, while Sigma Chain participated in manipulative trading, artificially boosting the platform&#8217;s trading volume, and only in 2022. Sigma Chain accounts were actively traded on 48 of 51 newly issued crypto assets between January 1 and June 23, 2022.</p>



<p>The lawsuit further claims that the defendants mixed and transferred billions of dollars in investor assets to another firm, Merit Peak Limited, which is managed by CZ and seems to be used to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>According to reports, CZ and his holding firm own 100% of Binance and Binance.US.</p>



<p>The SEC also claims the exchange, among other things, of improperly permitting high-profile US corporations to trade on Binance.com and of commingling client funds between its US and non-US organizations. Binance.US characterized the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit as &#8220;baseless,&#8221; while the exchange dismissed its attempts to seek a settlement with the agency.</p>



<p>In addition, the SEC stated that at least $145 million was moved from Binance.US accounts to Sigma Chain accounts in 2021. Another $45 million was placed into the account via a Nevada trust linked to Binance.US, and Sigma Chain used $11 million from the account to buy a boat.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that, similar to the confusing structure of FTX and FTX.US, the SEC contends that the exchange had access to Binance.US&#8217; wallets and assets, as well as the custodial tools and private keys of the U.S. firm. The exchange is also the designated custodian for crypto assets deposited, kept, traded, and accumulated on the Binance.US platform until December 2022, at the very least. Changpeng Zhao approved various trading-related choices on the Binance.US platform, including the client account establishing procedure, front-end access development, and the building of reserves to support ACH deposits.</p>



<p>The SEC has requested that the court order an immediate verification accounting of Binance and Binance.US&#8217;s finances, asset freezing and return, document preservation, and the appointment of a receiver for the exchange&#8217;s assets.</p>

<p>Former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks was mentioned in a transcript connected to exhibit papers in the SEC&#8217;s complaint against the exchange, BAM Trading, BAM Management, and Zhao.</p>



<p>When asked about his job as CEO of Binance.US, Brooks stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I did not work for Binance.com, that nobody at Binance.com was my boss, and that my role was to complete and highlight the corporate separateness. So when I talked to CZ, I considered myself to be talking to him in his role as board chair BAM Trading.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“What became clear to me at a certain point was [that] CZ was the CEO of BAM Trading, not me…That wasn’t because Binance.com somehow controlled us, but again, he owns the vast majority of Binance.com so I put that aside,” he continued.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">&#8220;Tai Chi&#8221; plan to attract American customers</h2>



<p>According to the SEC&#8217;s 13-count complaint, the issue stems from the company&#8217;s blatant contempt for federal securities laws, and the exchange and CZ have enriched themselves by billions of dollars while putting investors&#8217; funds at severe risk.</p>



<p>The so-called &#8220;Tai Chi strategy,&#8221; which <em>Forbes</em> first reported on January 2020, looks to be the exchange&#8217;s intention to publicly exit from the US market while keeping a presence via associated entities. Binance sued <em>Forbes</em> for the claim in November 2020 but dropped the action in February 2021.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, internal exchange personnel explored strategies to enable US users to trade on Binance.com.</p>



<p>The exchange stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The SEC’s actions here appear to be part of a rushed effort to claim jurisdictional ground from other regulators—and investors do not appear to be the SEC’s priority.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In essence, Binance carried out most of the Tai Chi plan, Zhao and the exchange retained extensive engagement and control over the U.S. firm, and Zhao instructed Binance to approve and conceal numerous high-value transactions, according to the SEC.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the exchange earned $11.6 billion in income from June 2018 to July 2021, the majority of which came from trading fees. Binance.US had its own OTC trading desk. Alameda Research, created by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, is the transaction&#8217;s counterparty.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">At least 12 tokens are securities on the exchange</h2>



<p>The SEC views Binance.US&#8217;s BNB, BUSD, and collateralized investment products to be unregistered securities. It also stated that BAM Trading&#8217;s pledge program qualified as an investment contract under its definition of security.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the exchnage and BAM Trading unlawfully offered and sold crypto-asset securities, including the exchange&#8217;s own BNB and BUSD, as well as Binance&#8217;s earning programs BNB Vault and Earn and the so-called &#8220;cryptocurrency&#8221; accessible on Binance.US website.</p>



<p>In the complaint, the SEC classifies the following tokens as securities: BNB, BUSD, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and Coti (COTI).</p>



<p>Significantly, Ethereum was not named as a security in the SEC&#8217;s case. At a nearly five-hour hearing in April, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler refused to say if ETH constituted a security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Is this the conclusion of the story?</h2>



<p>The SEC and CFTC have been fighting over who will be the principal regulator of cryptocurrency trading. In March of this year, the CFTC charged the exchange and Zhao, with violating federal law by offering unregistered crypto derivatives. Several of the SEC&#8217;s claims are identical to those of the CFTC. It has control over the cryptocurrency business, according to another large bet.</p>



<p>The SEC wants to prohibit Binance, Binance.US, and their respective agents from violating federal law by ordering the defendants to pay any ill-gotten proceeds plus prejudgment interest in the action. Some optimistic feel that the claim is a civil complaint and that the exchange would be fined heavily.</p>



<p>Yet, others speculate that the exchange may be permanently barred from accessing the American market. In the filing, the SEC said that it seeks to bar CZ from acting as an officer or director of any securities issuer, as well as to prohibit Binance, Binance.US, and CZ from dealing in or trading in any securities, including encrypted asset securities. According to the complaint, this includes prohibiting the defendants from working as an unlicensed broker, clearing house, or dealing with any crypto asset securities.</p>



<p>Binance has been accused by both the CFTC and the SEC of failing to comply with US anti-money laundering legislation. The United States Treasury Department, which supervises the majority of the country&#8217;s anti-money laundering apparatus, has yet to reply. If the exchange is accused of breaking sanctions, the majority of the evidence in the civil complaint might be published. Used to support separate Treasury and Justice Department enforcement proceedings.</p>



<p>The exchange has said that it expects the United States Congress would step in and adopt bipartisan legislation to build a functional regulatory framework for digital assets, preventing the crypto sector from becoming a victim of bureaucratic overreach.</p>
