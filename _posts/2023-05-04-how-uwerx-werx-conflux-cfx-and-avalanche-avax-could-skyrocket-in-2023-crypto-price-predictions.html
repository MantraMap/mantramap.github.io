<p>Digital assets have reminded everybody how rapidly they can move when they want to. Investors underexposed to the market are beginning to shake off their bearish mentality, desperate to enter before it takes off. When questioned about protocols that could skyrocket in 2023, analysts returned three names consistently: Uwerx, Conflux (CXS), and Avalanche (AVAX). This article analyzes these protocols and lays out price predictions for each token in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX) Price Prediction Uwerx is a bold disruptor currently at its presale launch that is looking to reshape the entire freelance marketplace industry by launching a decentralized alternative to the Polygon (MATIC) network. Uwerx has opened its presale to fund the creation and deployment of the Uwerx platform, and investors can currently purchase WERX tokens for just $0.00995. SolidProof and InterFi Network have already audited the protocol, and the Uwerx team announced they would lock liquidity for 25 years following the end of the presale. On-chain data shows several seasoned traders going long already. The WERX token will power the entire Uwerx platform, and freelancers will need it to interact with the protocol giving it a significant source of natural demand. This has led analysts to make bullish predictions speculating that the WERX token may trade as high as $3.20 in Q3/Q4 2023. According to Nasdaq, a study released by DaVinci Payments found an estimated increase of 23 million gig workers versus 2019. Analysts pointed out that every single freelancer is a potential user of the Uwerx platform. Conflux (CFX) Price Prediction Conflux (CXS) has been performing well recently, and Conflux (CXS)&nbsp; has been riding the China narrative. The Conflux (CXS) token powers the Conflux (CXS) network, a layer one blockchain protocol that connects communities across borders. Conflux (CXS) currently trades at $0.32, with analysts expecting Conflux (CXS) to trade between $0.26 and $0.35. Conflux (CXS) has already reached the upper limit of analysts&rsquo; predictions, hinting that this token and the China narrative driving its growth still have a good distance to go before the year closes. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction Avalanche (AVAX) went live in 2020, and since then Avalanche (AVAX) has been a thriving ecosystem for DeFi enthusiasts. Avalanche (AVAX), performance-wise, is one of the best Layer one blockchains in the space, offering robust security guarantees and sub-one-second transaction finality. Avalanche (AVAX) hosts a web of dApps and constantly expands its offerings. Avalanche (AVAX) currently trades at $17.21, with analysts expecting Avalanche (AVAX) to trade between $20.03 and $23.23 in 2023. However, several analysts said they believe Avalanche (AVAX) has greater upside potential. Uwerx: A Future Blue Chip?Overarching analysts continued to return to Uwerx when pressed for tokens with the highest growth potential. Given that the token is still in its presale, investors join on the ground level. If adoption levels meet the forecasts made by analysts, WERX could easily go parabolic.
