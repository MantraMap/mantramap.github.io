<ul><li>The Aptos token (APT) has reached an all-time high price of $17.2.&nbsp;</li><li>The token has skyrocketed more than 370% since the beginning of the year.</li><li>A series of high-profile partnerships over the past month have contributed to this unprecedented rally.&nbsp;</li><li>On-chain metrics suggest that traders expect the momentum to run out soon.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Aptos became arguably the most talked about layer 1 blockchain today after its native token&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">APT</a>&nbsp;reached an all-time high price of $11.2. The token has been in a rather impressive uptrend since the beginning of this year, going from $3.4 on 1 January all the way to $17.2.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Aptos skyrockets 400%</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The unprecedented rally of more than 370% this early into 2023 has made Aptos rather popular among crypto circles on social media, given the overall bearish sentiment in the market. Earlier today, APT became the center of a feud among high-profile crypto influencers who alleged&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/HsakaTrades/status/1618055402129874949" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">manipulation</a>&nbsp;of the token’s price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rally can be attributed to the partnerships that Aptos secured over the past month. The deployment of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x959b9da76401a7a3fb73e417b69ef51859383bd523d887350ae9f69148fc26a8?chain=bsc" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PancakeSwap</a>&nbsp;earlier this month marked the beginning of the rally. The popular decentralized exchange (DEX) announced that it had agreed to a multichain deployment to the layer 1 blockchain, leading to a price appreciation of 48% in the following days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was followed by integration into&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AtomicWallet/status/1613854034179522560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1613854034179522560%7Ctwgr%5E484c9fcfc6f2f3504d7a1e71372336549175bbfe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F119879%2Faptos-soars-week-leading-layer-1-token-rally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atomic Wallet</a>&nbsp;and growing interest in NFT marketplaces on Aptos. Despite being&nbsp;<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aptos-mainnet-butt-of-jokes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a>&nbsp;just three months ago, the blockchain has managed to grow significantly. With a market capitalization of $2.7 billion, APT has become the 26th largest crypto. The growing popularity has attracted opportunistic traders, leading to a 142% surge in the token’s trading volume over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, the latest trading volume came in at $2.1 billion, rather close to the token’s market cap. The high trading volume isn’t necessarily a positive metric. Data from on-chain analytics firm&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coinglass</a>&nbsp;shows that the total open interest on APT futures has increased by more than 81% since yesterday. <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Liquidation data</a>&nbsp;on Coinglass revealed that the token had $14.5 million worth of shorts against longs totaling $2.2 million. One might argue that the heavy betting on shorts indicates that traders expect the momentum to run out soon.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Celsius will process the withdrawals of certain customers following authorization by the bankruptcy court.&nbsp;</li><li>A second court order authorized a Flare token airdrop to eligible XRP holders on the platform.&nbsp;</li><li>The firm’s lawyers have floated the idea of issuing a new token to repay its customers.&nbsp;</li><li>The native token CEL and Flare have lost more than 7% of their value since the court orders came out.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a recent court hearing, a bankruptcy judge authorized Celsius to process the withdrawal requests of certain customers. The court order comes as a relief to the bankrupt <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-mashinsky-sued-fraud-ny/">crypto lender</a>’s customers who have been waiting since July 2022 to access their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Celsius to return funds and airdrop Flare </strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174901242380000000152.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">court order</a>, Celsius has been authorized to return the cryptocurrency that its customers had deposited before it filed for bankruptcy last year. Customers will be able to withdraw their funds &#8220;net of any gas fees or transaction costs in order to effectuate the withdrawal or transfer of digital assets&#8221;. However, all withdrawals would have to be in the form of crypto, no fiat withdrawals will be permitted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Martin Glenn also signed a second <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174901242380000000158.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">order</a>, which authorized the bankrupt crypto lender to airdrop Flare tokens to eligible account holders i.e, customers who held at least 1 XRP during the XRP snapshot. The snapshot was taken in December 2020 and qualifies the holders to receive 1 FLR for every XRP in their account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawyers representing Celsius floated the idea of issuing a new crypto token to repay the firm’s creditors. The new token was part of a broader plan to restructure the company as a publicly traded “recovery corporation”. Per this plan, creditors would receive Asset Share Tokens (AST) that reflect the value of their assets. The plan is yet to be approved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tokens associated with Celsius and the court hearing have taken a considerable hit. Since the court orders went public, the native token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celsius/" rel="nofollow noopener">CEL</a> has lost more than 7% of its value. Meanwhile, the price of Flare (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flare/" rel="nofollow noopener">FLR</a>) has gone down 8%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The MakerDAO proposal to earn yield from a Yearn Finance vault was backed by the governance community.</li><li>Yearn Finance&#8217;s special investment vehicle or vault has a cap of $100 million.</li><li>The USD Coin treasury allocation from Dai&#8217;s developer will earn a 2% annual yield if approved by an executive vote. </li></ul>



<p>The MakerDAO governance community <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qma4jEPY#vote-breakdown" rel="nofollow noopener">backed</a> a proposal to deploy $100 million of Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) in a Yearn Finance yield-generating account called a “vault”. The proposal was submitted on January 9, 2023 as the DAI stablecoin operator looks to diversify its treasury allocations and earn yield. </p>



<p>MIP92 which stands for Maker Improvement Proposal suggested investing $100 million USDC in Yearn Finance’s vault account to earn around 2% yield annually. This means that the protocol stands to make $2 million every year on its YearnFi investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yearn Finance is a yield aggregator developed by the acclaimed “Godfather of DeFi”, Andre Cronje. The decentralized finance protocol runs atop Ethereum’s blockchain and allows users to deposit assets in the service in exchange for yield or interest. </p>



<p>A total of 68 votes were cast with 95,666.284 of Maker’s native token MKR used to back the decisions. 71.56% of the votes supported the proposal to deploy USDC in Yearn Finance while 28.44% stood against the idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next step for MIP92 involves an executive vote before the proposal is either binned or implemented in Maker’s protocol.</p>



<h2>MakerDAO, Other DeFi Protocols Pick USDC For Investments</h2>



<p>This is not MakerDAO’s first time depositing USDC in DeFi yield-generating platforms. Indeed, the DAI issuer has previous treasury allocations in protocols like Aave and Compound. The project also reviewed a Coinbase proposal to park $1.6 billion USDC to earn 1.5% annual yield back in September 2022.</p>



<p>Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is considering a proposal to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-name-service-proposes-auction/">swap 10,000 Ether</a> (ETH) for 13 million worth of USDC in a Gnosis auction. The ENS community member opined that bolstering the platform&#8217;s USDC reserves will secure operational liquidity enough for 24 months. </p>



<p>Despite being the second-largest stablecoin in the crypto market, protocols seemingly tilt towards Circle’s dollar-backed token when making DeFi bets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Financial Times reported that the U.S. SEC was the sole factor that blocked Circle from going public.</li><li>CEO Jeremey Allaire said in December that his firm could not meet the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;qualification in time&#8221;.</li><li>The crypto payments company was set to go public in a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal with Bob Diamond&#8217;s Concord Acquisition.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto stablecoin company Circle named the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the sole reason why its special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal fell through, the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10bfdb8e-3a16-4bd2-a979-2d4b4c86ea41" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, CEO Jeremy Allaire announced the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circles-spac-deal-concord-will-not-happen/">termination</a> of the SPAC agreement with Concord Acquisition back in early December 2022. Concord was founded by veteran investment banker Bob Diamond in 2021 amid a pulsating bull market cycle where assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum peaked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2021 Circle unveiled the SPAC proposal with Concord in a deal that would double the crypto company’s valuation to a staggering $9 billion. Allaire’s form submitted its first SEC filing toward the move in August 2021, per reports.</p>



<p>Allaire’s update on the deal in December noted that his firm did not meet an SEC qualification time regarding an S-4 registration filing. Companies file S-4 documents with the SEC to secure authorization to offer new shares.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FT reported that the SEC did not declare Circle’s S-4 registration effective and the crypto company disclosed delayed feedback from the regulator, noting that there was “an awfully long time waiting for approvals”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Allaire said in December that the crypto payments processor retained intentions to go public despite the failed SPAC deal.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Circle Boosts Trust In USDC With Deloitte Partnership&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The USDC issuer stunned competitors when the company announced an auditing partnership with “Big Four” accounting firm Deloitte. Circle revealed the news alongside its first annual “state of the USDC economy” <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-releases-first-annual-state-of-the-usdc-economy" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-releases-first-annual-state-of-the-usdc-economy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our history of pioneering transparency underscores our commitment to providing USDC holders and the general public with open, timely reporting on how we minimize risk and maintain liquidity in the USDC reserve.</p></blockquote>



<p>USDC remained the second-largest stablecoin token in the world with a market cap of around $43 billion, dipping from over $55 billion in June 2022 following a series of spectacular implosions in the crypto market. Only Tether’s USDT currently beats Circle’s USD Coin for the top stablecoin spot.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>SushiSwap has approved a key proposal to increase the fee allocation to the Treasury to 100%.&nbsp;</li><li>The community also approved a proposal to clawback more than 10 million SUSHI tokens.&nbsp;</li><li>Head Chef Jared Grey proposed to increase the Kanpai allocation to strengthen the Treasury last year.</li><li>Both proposals were approved with overwhelming support from the community.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>SushiSwap is set to implement two key proposals after they were approved by its community recently. Both proposals are part of Jared Grey’s vision and future roadmap for the decentralized exchange (DEX). Grey is the DEX’s CEO or the “Head Chef”. The proposals were approved by the community with overwhelming support, with the implementation coming within a month of approval.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>SushiSwap will divert all exchange fees to the Treasury</strong></h2>



<p>The initial <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sushiswap-run-out-of-money-in-1-5-years/">proposal</a> by Head Chef Jared Grey was posted on the governance forum back in December 2022. The idea was to increase Kanpai to 100% of the trading fees sent to the Treasury. By diverting all the fees to the Treasury for 1 year, SushiSwap would be able to extend its runway, which Grey claimed was just 1.5 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A second proposal was <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth/proposal/0xf0353dcc69b766e96e2d1f65f76be2f13c03c1df7ed5ef483e9352e0da59a821" rel="nofollow noopener">approved</a> by the community, as per which more than 10 million SUSHI tokens sitting in the Merkle Distributor will be clawed back. The proposed duration to claim the tokens will be 3 months. At the time of writing, the value of these tokens stood at nearly $14.7 million. The clawed-back SUSHI will be deposited into the Treasury.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These measures to boost SushiSwap’s Treasury are being taken to help the DEX maintain its operations amid a brutal crypto winter that led to a loss of $30 million last year. So far, the annual expenses have been brought down from $9 million to $5 million. Head Chef Jared Grey posted a proposal for <a href="https://forum.sushi.com/t/new-tokenomics-calculators-proofs/11701" rel="nofollow noopener">new tokenomics</a> earlier today and has welcomed the feedback from his community and the broader crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We believe the best token model outcome is supported by healthy dialogue and feedback and welcome your increased engagement in the discussion surrounding Sushi’s newly proposed model,”</p><cite>Head Chef Jared Grey</cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>Binance held token collateral and user funds in the same cold wallet.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange claims it was a mistake and is currently rectifying the issue.&nbsp;</li><li>The cold wallet currently holds both customer funds and reserves for over 40 Binance-peg tokens.</li><li>The exchange previously stated that all B Tokens were backed 1:1.</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest exchange was caught in controversy earlier today after reports alleging the mixing of user funds with token reserves came out. Binance reportedly admitted to holding customer funds in the same account that holds the reserves for almost half of the Binance-peg tokens, also known as B-Tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance 8 wallet held both reserves and user funds</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-24/binance-bnb-acknowledges-storing-users-crypto-with-reserves-in-error#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the exchange held the reserves for nearly half of the 90 B Tokens in <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xf977814e90da44bfa03b6295a0616a897441acec" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance 8</a>, which is a cold wallet that also contains a considerable amount of customer funds. Data from Etherscan shows that this wallet currently holds over $10 billion worth of crypto tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data from the exchange’s <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/collateral-btokens" rel="nofollow noopener">official website</a> provides a detailed breakdown of the holdings. As is evident from the listings, the tokens held in the cold wallet are more than the amount of B Tokens issued by the exchange, which indicates the mixing of token collateral with user funds.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Binance 8’ is an exchange cold wallet. Collateral assets have previously been moved into this wallet in error and referenced accordingly on the B-Token Proof of Collateral page. Binance is aware of this mistake and is in the process of transferring these assets to dedicated collateral wallets,”</p><cite>a spokesperson told Bloomberg</cite></blockquote>



<p><br>The spokesperson stressed that all B Tokens were fully collateralized and held 1:1. The same was claimed by the exchange last week in a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/increasing-the-transparency-of-11-backing-for-btokens-3211397767770218173" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>. The mixing of funds came under heavy scrutiny after the downfall of the Bahamas-based crypto exchange and former rival <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ceo-says-exchange-may-be-restarted/">FTX</a>. This very reason promoted the publishing of proof-of-reserves (PoR) from several exchanges to restore the public’s faith in their operational ability.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Binance processed 205,000 transactions between May 2018 and January 2023, per a Chainlysis report from Tuesday.</li><li>The leading crypto exchange also reportedly facilitated $90 million in BTC trading volume for Bitzlato post-August 2021, after announcing plans to beef up anti-money laundering checks.</li><li>Bitzlato is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and its Founder Anatoly Legkodymov was charged with money laundering.</li></ul>



<p>On-chain security firm Chainlysis reported on Tuesday that Binance facilitated over $345.8 million in Bitcoin trading volume for investigated Russian crypto exchange Bitzlato. Bitzlato was accused of money laundering by the U.S. Department of Justice and its Founder Anatoly Legkodymov was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a> on money laundering charges. </p>



<p>Bitzlato fell under scrutiny for allegedly handing $700 million in illegal wealth in an operation that prosecutors said: “fueled a high-tech axis of crypto crime”. The platform was accused of adopting lax background checks and acting as a primary money laundering front connected to Russian crime organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-binance-moved-346-million-120123053.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29pbmRlc2suY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALzQjvw4595-ypxrhTdx0ZkQ2WA5fIUfz4kXsllMq7pFiKoiys_7AWUN7pTJAC78vdqVgQflhsOQ0vWkGOTKwyOzp0GwAoCTxGDc2OTmKF0eqoNxqua1SyuYSwQPVOiRxy8fiIFx3tgwdnDdP0MeQFdtWcPGfh0lnONrofWYtPL0" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-binance-moved-346-million-120123053.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29pbmRlc2suY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALzQjvw4595-ypxrhTdx0ZkQ2WA5fIUfz4kXsllMq7pFiKoiys_7AWUN7pTJAC78vdqVgQflhsOQ0vWkGOTKwyOzp0GwAoCTxGDc2OTmKF0eqoNxqua1SyuYSwQPVOiRxy8fiIFx3tgwdnDdP0MeQFdtWcPGfh0lnONrofWYtPL0" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters </a>report on the matter, Binance was responsible for some 205,000 digital asset transactions between May 2018 and mid-January 2023 when American authorities cracked down on Bitzlato. </p>



<p>The U.S Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) also named Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s crypto exchange was one of three major counterparties for the Russian platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the report said that $90 million of BTC transactions were processed after August 2021. Notably, Binance unveiled plans to implement tight anti-money laundering (AML) checks and improved Know-Your-Customer (KYC) standards in the same month. </p>

<h2>Binance Confirms Error Involving B-Tokens And Customer Asset Storage</h2>



<p>A Bloomberg report said that crypto’s largest centralized exchange erroneously stored customer funds and token collateral in the same wallet. The leading exchange kept collateral for tokens issued on its Binance Smart Chain or BNB Chain network and user assets in a “single wallet called Binance 8”.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-voyager-digital-court-approval/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-voyager-digital-court-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CZ’s company</a> spotted the issue but the juggernaut crypto platform is already working to resolve the matter, per the report. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Binance 8 is an exchange cold wallet. Collateral assets have previously been moved into this wallet in error and referenced accordingly on the B-Token Proof of Collateral page. Binance is aware of this mistake and is in the process of transferring these assets to dedicated collateral wallets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Developers finalized the &#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217; on Thursday.</li><li>The move marks the first major test phase for Ethereum&#8217;s hyped Shanghai updated in March 2023.</li><li>ETH Developer Marius Van Der Wijden noted configuration difficulties on Geth but said progress is underway.</li></ul>



<p>Ethereum developers <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> a ‘shadow fork’ of the Shanghai update built to test the withdrawal of Staked Ether (ETH) from crypto&#8217;s leading altcoin blockchain. Developers dubbed the test environment &#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217;, suggesting the first of many testnets. </p>



<p>A shadow fork refers to a testing ground or trial network built to simulate the main blockchain, in this case, Ethereum. The shadow fork allows engineers and developers to run code, smooth bugs, and finalize an upgrade before shipping to the mainnet. A similar approach was leveraged when preparing for the massive transition to proof-of-stake in 2022. </p>



<p>&#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217; was designed to test the withdrawal mechanism for staked ETH that is expected to roll out with the Shanghai update. According to Marius Van Der Wijden, a developer at the ETH Foundation, the shadow fork was successfully finalized on Monday around 5:30 am ET. </p>



<p>Van Der Wijden noted that some bugs emerged when applying the shadow fork configurations on Geth, an execution client of ETH networks that handles key operations like transactions and execution of smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ETH coders tackled the issues, however, and “all nodes are in agreement” said Van Der Wijden in a tweet. The next step for developers in Shanghai’s first shadow fork is to create evil nodes to further test the update. Evil nodes create invalid blocks and try to pull other network nodes away from the main chain. </p>

We will start some evil nodes,.</p>&mdash; MariusVanDerWijden (@vdWijden) <a href="https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1617530244302532615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Ethereum Developers Move To Unlock 16 Million Staked ETH</h2>



<p>The Shanghai update currently believed to go live in March 2023 will unlock over 16 million ETH currently staked on Ethereum by validators. Indeed, the massive staked Ether makes up over 13% of ETH’s total supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers plan to build in a daily withdrawal cap to cushion the potential price impact from mass withdrawals. The cap is set at around 57,600 ETH per day. Liquid staking platform <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido Finance</a> currently tops the staked ETH leaderboard with over 4.6 million Ether <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/">locked</a> through the service. </p>



<p>The number of validators on ETH&#8217;s network also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed</a> 500,000, a landmark moment as entities prepare for withdrawal functionality with the Shanghai upgrade.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Over 6,000 Uniswap community members voted on the proposal from 0xPlasma Labs.</li><li>Around 80% voted to launch the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange on BNB Chain.</li><li>The 0xPlasma Labs proposal opined that the DEX would enjoy added liquidity and onboard over a million active users by tapping the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.</li></ul>



<p>The Uniswap community <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">voted</a> in favor of launching Ethereum&#8217;s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on BNB Chain to tap broader crypto liquidity and expand beyond ETH’s native blockchain network. </p>



<p>Some 6,495 community members spent a total of 24.9 million UNI voting on the proposal submitted by 0xPlasma Labs, a blockchain company led by Ilia Maskimenka. The results of the vote showed that 80.28% of members voted Yes spending 20 million UNI to back their decision. 19.72% of the votes spent 4.9 million UNI to oppose deploying the DEX on BNB Chain.</p>



<p>Ethereumworldnews previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/0xplasma-labs-uniswap-binance-bnb-chain/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/0xplasma-labs-uniswap-binance-bnb-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> the proposal’s first draft which rolled out on December 12, 2022. 0xPlasma Labs, an on-chain infrastructure developer focused on building tools for Uniswap, opined that the proposal would propel broader access to Ethereum’s largest DEX and tap liquidity from DeFi’s second-largest ecosystem. </p>



<p>The proposal will now advance to a governance vote. </p>



<h2>Uniswap To Compete With PancakeSwap</h2>



<p>Indeed, launching Uniswap on BNB Chain could throw the trading venue into direct competition with PancakeSwap. Launched in 2020, PancakeSwap was built as a decentralized exchange for the BNB Chain ecosystem, similar to how Uniswap was built for Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DefiLama data showed that PancakeSwap boasted over $2.45 billion in total liquidity locked (TVL) with most of its TVL on Binance Smart Chain. Also, another $1.05 billion was locked up in staking facilities on the exchange at press time. The leading DEX on Binance’s blockchain also records hundreds of millions in daily trading volume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uniswap V3 could look to tap more than a million active user addresses on BNB Chain and secure a share of $5 billion in TVL on DeFi’s second-largest ecosystem. Currently, the Ethereum-based DEX has around $2.68 billion in TVL spread across ETH’s main chain, and layer 2 side chains like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Genesis filed for bankruptcy protection late on Thursday revealing $3.6 billion owed to the top 50 creditors.</li><li>Top unsecured claimants included Gemini, Babel Finance, VanEck, and Cumberland among others.</li><li>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss once again threatened legal against Genesis&#8217;s parent company DCG and CEO Barry Silbert. </li></ul>



<p>The Winklevii Founded Gemini was <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/genesis/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTQzOTA3OQ==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">named</a> a top creditor in a list of unsecured claims published by bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global. Genesis filed for bankruptcy late on Thursday roughly two months after the imposition of the crypto exchange FTX. </p>



<p>According to the court filing submitted in the Southern District of New York, Genesis owes over $3.6 billion to its top 50 unsecured creditors. The crypto lender also confirmed between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and liabilities. The filing covers Genesis Global Holdco LLC, Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd, and Genesis Global Capital LLC which served as the partner firm for Gemini’s beleaguered Earn product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thursday’s unsecured claims list noted that Gemini is owed $766 million. Two other creditors are owed a combined $692.2 million but both names were redacted in the court filing. Other members of the top 50 creditors category include Mirana Corp (owed $151 million), Babel Finance (owed $150 million),&nbsp; and VanEck New Finance Income Fund (owed $53 million) to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DCG subsidiary said the late filing was a “strategic action to achieve a global resolution to maximize value for all clients and stakeholders”. The filing comes a few months after the fall of FTX and uncertainty surrounding the lenders’ parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG)</p>



<h2>Winklevoss Threatens Lawsuit Against Genesis Parent Company DCG</h2>



<p>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss threatened to sue the crypto lenders&#8217; parent company DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert for lying to investors about the company’s financial health. Cameron tweeted on Friday that the bankruptcy filing “does not insulate Barry, DCG, and any other wrongdoers from accountability”. </p>



<p>Both parties engaged <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-barry-silberts-resignation-dcg/">embroiled</a> in a public spat ever since Genesis Global Capital paused withdrawals, essentially cutting off liquidity for Gemini’s Earn program and its 340,000+ users. The crypto lender supposedly buckled amid back-to-back exposure to crippled entities Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6/ Unless Barry and DCG come to their senses and make a fair offer to creditors, we will be filing a lawsuit against Barry and DCG imminently.</p>&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1616302998736756737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, Thursday’s filing raises questions regarding <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-confirmed-grayscale-gbtc/">Grayscale’s</a> Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product, another entity owned by DCG. Crypto participants have expressed worries that bankruptcy proceedings could have a domino effect on the company’s massive BTC holdings which exceed 600,000 at press time. </p>
