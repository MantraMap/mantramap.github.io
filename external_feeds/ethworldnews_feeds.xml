<ul><li>Court filings by the U.S. SEC claim that Jump Trading entered a secret deal with Do Kwon in 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>Jump Trading allegedly propped up Terraform Labs’ TerraUSD stablecoin a year before it collapsed.&nbsp;</li><li>The deal allowed TerraUSD to regain its dollar peg in 2021 in exchange for a discount on Luna purchases by Jump.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Chicago-based Jump Trading is once again in the crosshairs of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as recent court filings by the securities regulator highlight a secret deal between the high-frequency trading firm and the now defunct Terraform Labs involving the latter’s TerraUSD stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Jump Trading Made Over $1 Billion After Secret Deal With Do Kwon</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jump-trading-did-secret-deal-to-prop-up-terrausd-stablecoin-sec-says-11335951" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, recent court filings made by the SEC as part of its ongoing fraud lawsuit against Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon confirmed that Jump Trading was the unnamed U.S. trading firm that was listed in the initial <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-32.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">complaint</a>. The complaint alleged that when the TerraUSD stablecoin lost its peg to the US Dollar in May 2021, Kwon and Terraform Labs entered into a secret deal with Jump Trading to prop up its price. As per said deal, Jump purchased large amounts of TerraUSD which drove up the stablecoin’s price and helped it regain its peg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In exchange for helping restore TerraUSD’s peg, Terraform Labs allowed Jump to buy its Luna token at 30, 40, and 50 cents over the next three years. The agreed-upon price allowed Jump Trading to scoop up Luna tokens at a massive discount, which ultimately netted more than $1 billion for the trading firm. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/jump-trading-sec-unnamed-firm-terra/">Reports</a> of Jump&#8217;s involvement with Terraform Labs’ started circulating earlier this year after the SEC filed charges against Do Kwon and his crypto firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jump Trading’s role in helping TerraUSD regain its dollar pegs contradicts the claims made by Do Kwon about the stablecoin’s self-healing capability. The SEC has accused Kwon of making misleading statements about the capabilities of the stablecoin’s underlying algorithm while keeping investors in the dark about secret deals that actually propped up TerraUSD. As of now, Jump Trading has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the stablecoin or Terraform Labs’ collapse in May last year.</p>

<ul><li>BlockFi has planned to liquidate its crypto lending platform after determining that its the best course of action for creditors.</li><li>The bankrupt crypto lender’s decision comes after multiple unsuccessful attempts to sell the business.&nbsp;</li><li>The firm’s inability to secure a value-maximizing offer was blamed on the recent regulatory scrutiny of crypto entities.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>New Jersey-based <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-custodial-account-300-million/">BlockFi</a> has announced its plans to liquidate its cryptocurrency lending platform following several unsuccessful attempts to sell the business. The bankrupt crypto lender has concluded that selling the lending business is the best course of action for its creditors and customers who have been stranded since November last year. </p>



<h2><strong>BlockFi’s Claims Against FTX &amp; Alameda Will Make a $1 Billion Difference</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/blockfi-moves-to-liquidate-its-crypto-lending-platform-ccd50083" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, BlockFi has determined that selling the crypto lending platform will not generate enough value for the bankrupt firm’s creditors and customers. The firm laid out its reorganization plan in a recent <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi/Home-DocketInfo" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. As per the court filing, the Chapter 11 reorganization plan has been sent to the bankrupt crypto lender’s creditors and over 100,000 retail customers for a vote. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We believe that our Plan is the fastest way for clients to receive the highest recovery of digital assets and conclude the Chapter 11 cases as quickly as possible.”</p><cite>Statement from BlockFi</cite></blockquote>



<p>BlockFi’s decision to initiate the self-liquidation transaction comes after back and forth with multiple potential buyers regarding a sale since January this year. The crypto lender found that a sale wouldn’t generate meaningful value for the creditors and that directly distributing assets after liquidation would extract more value for said creditors. The bankrupt crypto lender also cited the recent regulatory scrutiny of crypto entities as one of the reasons for not being able to secure a value-maximizing offer from prospective buyers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The amount that will be distributed to BlockFi’s creditors will depend on the outcome of pending litigation against its counterparties. The crypto lender has nearly $355 million frozen on the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and an outstanding $671 million loan to FTX’s sister firm Alameda Research. The outcome of the lawsuits involving FTX and other counterparties, including Three Arrows Capital and crypto miner Core Scientific, will make a difference of over $1 billion in BlockFi’s recoveries and the subsequent repayment to its creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Lido Finance has enabled Ethereum withdrawals after its V2 mainnet went live earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The community behind the DeFi staking platform passed an on-chain vote to approve the transition to version 2.&nbsp;</li><li>Lido’s governance token has gained more than 12% following the latest developments.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Lido Finance, the largest <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-v3-ethereum-l2-network-metis/">Ethereum</a> staking protocol, has activated the withdrawal of staked ether from its platform. The activation of Ethereum withdrawals comes with the liquid staking protocol’s move to version 2, which was approved through a governance vote earlier today by the community behind the staking platform. </p>



<h2><strong>Lido Finance Community Approved V2 With Overwhelming Majority</strong></h2>



<p>The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Lido Finance approved the governance <a href="https://vote.lido.fi/vote/156" rel="nofollow noopener">vote</a> to decide the move to V2 with an overwhelming majority earlier today. According to the on-chain voting platform Aragon, 100% of the members who participated in the vote were in favor of the transition to V2. The on-chain vote, which began on May 12, 2023, received 0 votes against the proposal.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The launch of Lido V2 represents an architectural evolution of the Lido protocol, ushering in both the ability for stETH holders to natively unstake their stETH in-protocol for ETH. Simple, accessible, and timely withdrawals are a core part of a full-fledged staking product.&#8221; </p><cite>Isidoros Passadis, Lido DAO contributor </cite></blockquote>



<p>The Lido V2 mainnet launch was described by the protocol as its most important upgrade to date. The move allows Ethereum stakers to directly unstake ETH through the protocol. The upgrade to V2 also enabled the platform’s staking router, which allows for the development of on-ramps for new Node Operators, ranging from solo stakers to DAOs and Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) clusters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The activation of Ether withdrawals on Lido comes a month after Ethereum&#8217;s Shapella Upgrade went live. The liquid staking platform expects the in-protocol ETH withdrawal functionality to streamline the overall staking experience for users and address previous inconveniences related to the protocol’s security. The latest development had led to a bullish impact on Lido’s governance token LidoDAO. The token has gained more than 12% over the past 24 hours, reaching as high as $2.17 earlier today.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Court documents show that the SEC could slash its $22 million fine against crypto company LBRY for alleged violations, per filing made on Friday, May 12.</li><li>The watchdog said that LRBY broke U.S. securities laws by offering unregistered LCB tokens.</li><li>The lawsuit filed in March 2021 which later secured a $22 million fine against LBRY from a U.S. Judge in November could end in a reduced penalty worth $111,614.</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59774584/107/us-securities-and-exchange-commission-v-lbry-inc/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59774584/107/us-securities-and-exchange-commission-v-lbry-inc/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed</a> to slash $22 million in monetary penalties issued against crypto company LBRY following a March 2021 regulatory lawsuit. </p>



<p>In November, a court in New Hampshire ruled against LBRY and backed the SEC&#8217;s claims. The watchdog sued LBRY for $22 million in March 2021 over its LCB tokens, alleging that the crypto startup violated U.S. rules by not registering its financial offering with the commission.</p>



<p>LBRY is a blockchain-based filesharing and payment network that powers decentralized platforms with a primary focus on social and video platforms. The startup denied any rule-breaking and entered a two-year-long legal battle with the commission. </p>



<p>LBRY argued that the commission&#8217;s fine was excessive, citing Kik&#8217;s $100 million token offering and the subsequent $5 million settlement after unregistered securities claims were levied.</p>



<p>The regulatory scene in the U.S. soured significantly in the months that followed after the LBRY lawsuit as federal and state agencies unleashed a sizzling crackdown on crypto businesses in America.</p>



<p>On May 12, the SEC cited LBRY&#8217;s &#8220;lack of funds and near-defunct status&#8221; and filed documents to reduce its fine to $111,614.</p>



<h2>SEC Spearheads America&#8217;s Crypto Crackdown</h2>



<p>The commission has rattled crypto&#8217;s ecosystem with several enforcement actions since the case against LBRY. Ripple, another crypto player, has an unsettled legal showdown with the watchdog over the sale of $1.3 billion in XRP coins.</p>



<p>Entities like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-reply-coinbase-petition-in-10-days/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-reply-coinbase-petition-in-10-days/">Coinbase</a> have looked towards off-shore jurisdictions amid America&#8217;s stifling crypto regulatory landscape. Still, industry juggernauts like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong remain confident of doing business in the U.S. as players push for clearer crypto rules.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>This phishing scammer has stolen funds in Bitcoin, Ether, Shib, and USDST since at least June last year.</li><li>SlowMist analysis of on-chain data shows that at least $15 million in cryptocurrencies has been drained from HitBTC users.</li><li>The scammer mirrors webpages of decentralized apps and web3 tools like HitBTC, Coinone, and LedgerX before draining connected wallets of their value.</li></ul>



<p>A crypto phishing scammer has <a href="https://twitter.com/MistTrack_io/status/1658050314774384642?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/MistTrack_io/status/1658050314774384642?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stolen</a> over $15 million from victims&#8217; wallets by mirroring UI built by crypto exchanges like HitBTC and digital asset service providers, per crypto tracking and compliance company SlowMist.</p>



<p>The scammer operates four wallets that have been identified so far. SlowMist also estimates that the phishing scammer has used these wallets since around June last year, stealing users&#8217; funds in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Shina Inu (SHIB), and stablecoin USDT. </p>

<h2>Phishing Technique Clones HitBTC Exchange</h2>



<p>The phishing process clones a decentralized app&#8217;s user interface &#8211; HitBTC in this case &#8211; and lures victims into connecting their wallets by clicking &#8220;Approve&#8221;. Approving here gives the phishing contract &#8220;unlimited authorization for your <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=cashtag_click" rel="nofollow noopener">$USDT</a>&#8220;. </p>



<p>Next, victims are directed to deposit assets like they would on an actual exchange. The crypto phishing scammer designed their cloned platform to only support deposits via the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tron networks. </p>



<p>Finally, the victim confirms the transaction thinking they&#8217;re trading on HitBTC&#8217;s actual platform. In the background, the phishers drain users&#8217; wallets of their ETH and other crypto balances. This phisher&#8217;s scamming portfolio features several fake websites as well. </p>

<h2>Millions Lost To Crypto Phishers</h2>



<p>Phishers have raided unsuspecting victims since the internet evolved into a mainstream network used by millions. These illicit actors also target crypto users thanks to the liquidity coursing through decentralized finance and blockchain ecosystems.</p>



<p>The intersection between web2 marketing tools and web3 platforms also creates an opportunity for phishers to attack crypto users. Google ads were used to steal over $4 million from thousands of users. The data <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-phishers-millions-users-google/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-phishers-millions-users-google/" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed</a> a surge in shady Google ads promoting fake websites. </p>

<ul><li>Binance has announced that it will wind down its operations in Canada.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange cited Canada’s challenging regulatory landscape for the decision to exit.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance joins the likes of dYdX and OKX, which have decided to leave the Canadian market for similar reasons.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange is set to exit the Canadian crypto market. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-us-cut-cz-stake-in-the-exchange/">Binance</a> announced earlier today that it will be winding down its operation in Canada, citing the challenging regulatory environment created by the enhanced investor protection commitments that were introduced by the Canadian Securities Administrators.</p>



<h2><strong>Binance: Canada Is No Longer A Tenable Market</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1657099651210969088?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> from Binance, the crypto exchange is proactively withdrawing from the Canadian marketplace. The tweet blamed Canada’s new guidance related to stablecoins and investor limits published for crypto exchanges for the firm’s decision to exit the country. The regulations reportedly made Canada untenable for the firm to operate in. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange stated that Canada was a relatively small market, but held sentimental value given that it is the home country of founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao. The exchange explored reasonable avenues to protect its Canadian users, but all efforts were futile. In the tweet, the exchange thanked the Canadian regulators who collaborated with the exchange to address regulatory concerns. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>While we do not agree with the new guidance, we hope to continue to engage with Canadian regulators aimed at a thoughtful, comprehensive regulatory framework.”</p></blockquote>



<p>As for the exchange’s Canadian customers, the tweet clarified that they received emails containing comprehensive information regarding the impact of the latest development. Binance is confident that it will return to Canada once its regulators allow citizens to access a broader range of digital assets. With its latest decision, Binance joins fellow crypto exchanges OKX and dYdX, which announced their intention to depart Canada earlier this year due to the shakeup in regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A Basic Court in Montenegro’s capital Podgorica agreed to bail terms for Do Kwon and a second Terra executive identified as Han Chang-joon.</li><li>Kwon will be released after paying $437,,000 or €400,000 in bail but he cannot leave his apartment or exit the country.</li><li>Montenegro authorities charged the Terraform Labs founder with forgery after he was detained before he boarded a private plane to Dubai.</li></ul>



<p>TerraUSD creator Do Kwon will be <a href="https://www.pobjeda.me/clanak/prihvaceno-jemstvo-od-800000-eura-korejskim-drzavljanima" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pobjeda.me/clanak/prihvaceno-jemstvo-od-800000-eura-korejskim-drzavljanima" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released</a> in Montenegro after a court in the country’s capital granted his bail request.</p>



<p>Kwon’s lawyers proposed a bail of $437,000 or the equivalent of €400,000 during a court hearing on Thursday. The charges claim that Do Kwon traveled with forged documents after his arrest in March.</p>



<p>Local prosecutors argued that the two suspects have the financial means to escape Montenegro and have “zero interest” in staying in the country, an argument seemingly insufficient for the court.</p>



<p>A Basic Court in Podgorica will allow Kwon to stay at his apartment after he pays the bail. Han, a Terra executive detained alongside Kwon, will pay the same amount. Both defendants cannot leave their apartment or Montenegro and must answer all court summons per the terms of Friday’s bail ruling. Montenegrin prosecutors have three days to appeal this ruling. </p>



<h2>Do Kwon Jail Time</h2>



<p>Do Kwon who was about to board a private jet bound for Dubai before his arrest could spend five years in a Montenegrin prison cell if convicted. Another court hearing is scheduled for June 16 as authorities prepare to prosecute the Terraform Labs founder for allegedly forging travel papers.</p>



<p>Even if Kwon is cleared in a Montenegro court, possible extradition awaits for the crypto entrepreneur whose company obliterated $40 billion from the market last May.</p>



<h2>Wen Extradition?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear how prosecution in Montenegro will affect extradition requests from South Korea and the U.S. Both jurisdictions hope to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-do-kwon-extradition/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-do-kwon-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">arraign</a> Do Kwon, although investigators in South Korea argue that trying him in his home country is the best option. </p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) already filed civil fraud charges against the Terraform Labs founder. </p>

<ul><li>Binance US and its owner Changpeng Zhao have reportedly been looking for ways to reduce his stake in the exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>Zhao launched the crypto exchange’s American arm in 2019 and owns a controlling stake in it.&nbsp;</li><li>People familiar with the matter revealed that CZ has been trying to sell part of his stake since last summer.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance US, the United States-based subsidiary of the world’s largest crypto exchange, is reportedly seeking to cut the stake of its owner and founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The American crypto exchange is working with Zhao and exploring ways to reduce the crypto billionaire’s controlling stake in the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance US Hopes To Reduce Regulatory Heat By Reducing CZ’s Stake</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/binance-us-explores-ways-to-cut-founder-changpeng-zhaos-majority-stake" rel="nofollow noopener">The Information</a>, Binance US and Changpeng Zhao have been looking into ways to reduce the latter&#8217;s stake in the crypto exchange for quite some time now. People familiar with the matter revealed that Zhao has been trying to sell part of his stake since as early as last summer. Zhao launched Binance US in 2019, just two years after he founded the more popular international exchange. </p>



<p>The intensifying regulatory scrutiny of Zhao, Binance, and its American arm has prompted the exchange to expedite the divesting process. In light of the recent legal trouble involving <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-doj-probe-russian-sanction/">Binance</a> and Zhao, the executives at Binance US have discussed how limiting the exchange’s relationship with Zhao and the international entity may help take some of the regulatory heat off the American entity. Given that Zhao holds a majority stake in the US exchange, reducing his share may put the exchange in a more favorable position in terms of its relationship with U.S. regulators. </p>



<p>The top management of Binance US believes that Changpeng Zhao’s involvement in the lawsuit that was recently filed by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may prevent the exchange from securing certain regulatory licenses to ensure smooth operation in the US crypto market. Earlier this year, the CFTC charged Zhao with willful evasion of federal law and operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange.</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is helping Ukrainian law enforcement to pursue Russian crypto sanctions evaders.&nbsp;</li><li>Chainalysis is collaborating with agencies from both nations to track individuals suspected of concealing their wealth using crypto.&nbsp;</li><li>Regulators and policymakers in the US have highlighted the potential role of crypto in sanctions evasion and money laundering.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has collaborated with blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis to guide and train law enforcement agencies in Ukraine to carry out investigations and identify those evading <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-doj-probe-russian-sanction/">crypto sanctions</a> imposed on Russia. News of the international collaboration comes more than a year after Ukraine was invaded by Russia, prompting high-profile Russian nationals to scramble to conceal their assets. </p>



<h2><strong>The U.S. Is Sponsoring Crypto Investigation Tool For Ukraine</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-trains-ukrainian-law-enforcement-to-pursue-russian-crypto-assets-e005ba5?mod=business_minor_pos4" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies and investigators will be part of a week-long training camp that will be held in Frankfurt, Germany. The Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigation division will provide advanced, in-person training to Ukrainian investigators which will help them track down illicit crypto transactions and financial networks used by sanctioned entities in Russia. </p>



<p>The IRS has been playing an active role in probing potential violations of sanctions imposed in Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February last year. The tax agency is reportedly involved in 23 sanctions-related investigations at the moment. As part of the collaboration with Ukraine, the IRS will provide cyber training to the country’s National Police, the Economic Security Bureau, the Security Service, and the Prosecutor General’s Office.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>One key area is the identification and elimination of centers of support for occupation forces that raise funds for the purchase of things necessary for the war. We often see fundraising campaigns conducted with the use of cryptocurrency.” </p><cite>Yurii Vykhodets, Head of the Cyber Department, National Police of Ukraine</cite></blockquote>



<p>The IRS has revealed that it sponsored Ukraine’s use of Chainalysis Reactor, a crypto investigation tool designed by the blockchain intelligence firm. The agency has provided Ukrainian authorities with licenses to use the product, which will aid in the tracking and identification of those attempting to circumvent Russian sanctions. The collaboration comes in light of multiple warnings issued by regulators and policymakers in the U.S. regarding sanction evasions and money laundering by Russian nationals.</p>
