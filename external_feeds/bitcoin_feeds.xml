<h2>Africa&#8217;s Share of Global Blockchain Funding Still Under 1%</h2>
<p>According to the latest Emurgo State of Web 3.0 in Africa report, the African continent’s cryptocurrency market &#8220;grew by over 1,200% between 2020 and 2021.&#8221; In addition, four African countries, namely Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania now feature the in the world’s top 20 for crypto adoption.</p>
<p>As shown by the data shared in the <a href="https://www.emurgo.africa/reports/emurgo-web-3-0-research-report.pdf">report</a>, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa accounted for 70% of the $88.5 million in blockchain funding which the continent received in 2021. However, despite this and the fact that African blockchain venture funding growth &#8220;was 11 times more when compared to general funding growth,&#8221; the continent’s share of total global blockchain funding is only 0.5%. This figure is nevertheless expected to grow when more companies attempt to create solutions to solve problems faced by the continent’s residents.</p>
<p>However, despite the underlying technology&#8217;s promise, as well as the impact that crypto assets have had on African residents, the report reveals that as much as 20% of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have banned crypto assets. The rest have either imposed some restrictions or implicit bans. The Central African Republic is the only African country to designate bitcoin as a legal tender.</p>
<p>As noted in the report, many countries in Africa have not embraced crypto assets due to their perceived risky nature. The collapse of crypto giants like the exchange FTX and subsequent ripple effects have seemingly reinforced governments’ negative perceptions about crypto assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Mitigating Against Risks Arising From Regulatory Changes</h2>
<p>Therefore, in order to help the continent’s crypto industry get on the good side of authorities, the authors of the report urged industry participants to consider working closely with regulators.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the need for the regulation of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies increases, key stakeholders need to work closely with regulators. This will ensure that risks that may arise as a result of regulatory changes are adequately mitigated,&#8221; authors of the Emurgo State of Web 3.0 report said.</p>
<p>More transparent regulations, on the other hand, will ostensibly see blockchain’s use cases increase. This increase in use cases will in turn spur further investments in the industry, according to the report.</p>

A rejection would prevent the exchange from advertising and growing in the major European market and deal another blow to its efforts to do regulated business on the Old Continent.</strong></p>
<h2>Germany Rejects Binance Bid to Obtain Bafin License, Sources Claim</h2>
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bafin</a>) has informed Binance it will not be licensed as a crypto custodian, the German financial news magazine Finance Forward revealed in a <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> quoting sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The digital asset exchange, the world’s largest by trading volume, can only expand its business in Germany if it receives the regulatory approval, the publication noted. Without it, it’s not allowed to advertise, for example, and German regulators have already targeted other crypto companies for that, including trading platforms like Crypto.com and Uniswap.</p>
<p>Bafin declined to clarify the situation with a spokesperson saying the authority does not comment on individual companies. “While we cannot share details of our discussions with regulators, we are continuing to work to meet Bafin requirements,” a representative of Binance was quoted as stating. The spokesperson emphasized this is an ongoing process and also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures in place to continue our discussions with the regulators in Germany.</p></blockquote>

<p> has been under increased pressure from regulatory bodies in Europe and elsewhere. Authorities in Belgium <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> the exchange to cease all crypto services while prosecutors in France <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">launched</a> an investigation based on money laundering allegations.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">exited</a> the Dutch market, after failing to register as a crypto service provider, applied for deregistration in Cyprus, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">cancelled</a> its U.K. authorization. The company also withdrew its application for license in Austria, Finance Forward noted.</p>
<p>This week, news came out that the exchange is looking for a new banking partner for euro deposits and withdrawals after payment processor Paysafe <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-lose-euro-transfers-as-paysafe-drops-support/">announced</a> its decision to discontinue support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEPA</a> transfers to and from the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

The court filing, submitted on Friday, states that the IRS is seeking details pertaining to accounts that registered an annual trading activity of $20,000 or higher during the years 2016 to 2020.</strong></p>
<h2>IRS Gains Court Order for Kraken&#8217;s Customer Data in Crypto Tax Investigation</h2>
<p>Last February, the IRS submitted a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66785511/united-states-v-payward-ventures-inc/">court petition</a> to the Northern District of California, outlining its intention to thoroughly investigate Kraken&#8217;s financial records and data in order to uncover cryptocurrency users who may have neglected their tax obligations. The petition specifically requested access to Kraken&#8217;s &#8220;books, records, papers, and other data.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The IRS is conducting an investigation to determine the identity and correct federal income tax liability of U.S. persons who conducted transactions in cryptocurrency for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020,” the petition declared.</p>
<p>According to the IRS, the tax agency sent Kraken’s parent company Payward Ventures Inc. a summons in 2021 in order to get customer info for traders who used the platform during the 2016-2020 period. The government believes that it has a valid reason for requesting the materials listed in the subpoena. The presiding judge Joseph C. Spero ruled that the IRS is authorized “to obtain items of even potential relevance to an ongoing investigation, without reference to its admissibility.”</p>

<p>Consequently, Spero granted the IRS&#8217;s request and authorized an order for Kraken to disclose comprehensive user information, including full names, pseudonyms or user IDs, dates of birth, taxpayer identification numbers, physical addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses. This requirement encompasses all Kraken users who have engaged in transactions involving cryptocurrency assets, regardless of the transaction type, with a combined value equal to or surpassing $20,000 within any of the stated years.</p>
<p>In November 2017, Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/court-ruling-grants-the-irs-personal-data-of-14000-coinbase-users/">complied</a> with a federal court order in San Francisco that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-compelled-by-irs-to-provide-13000-customers-information/">compelled</a> the company to disclose customer data to the IRS. The ruling mandated Coinbase to provide the tax agency with identifying details of users who had engaged in transactions exceeding $20,000 between 2013 and 2015. The IRS had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-irs-may-get-approved-to-conduct-coinbase-tax-probe/">set its sights</a> on cryptocurrency tax evaders, and Coinbase became entangled in the pursuit for information. The IRS&#8217;s legal tussle with Coinbase was referenced multiple times in the court case against Kraken.</p>

He stressed that there is nothing more destructive to wealth than inflation, emphasizing that the Fed &#8220;must keep their feet to the floorboard to prevent a re-occurrence of inflationary pressures.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Brandt’s Advice for the Federal Reserve</h2>
<p>Veteran trader Peter Brandt has urged the Federal Reserve to remain hawkish and increase interest rates by another 100 basis points. Brandt has been a futures and FX career trader since 1975. He is a chartist and the author of the Factor Report. He trades a variety of markets, including Dow futures, bonds, corn, crude oil, European wheat, Osaka Dow, U.S. dollar, and sugar.</p>
<p>“The U.S. Fed was negligent for not aggressively raising rates in early 2021,&#8221; he tweeted Thursday. &#8220;Traders knew this, but the Ph.D.s had their heads up their butts.&#8221; He added: &#8220;But now, I congratulate the Fed as it wants to remain hawkish. The market is concerned about unemployment and possible recession. Those are the least of our worries.”</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;higher unemployment is the least of our worries,&#8221; Brandt opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is NOTHING more destructive to wealth than inflation. The Fed must keep their feet to the floorboard to prevent a re-occurrence of inflationary pressures. While the Fed was asleep at the switch in 2021, increasing rates another 100 basis points would do wonders to protect the nation&#8217;s wealth.</p></blockquote>

<p>In March, Brandt tweeted that people who criticized the Federal Reserve for risking a recession because of rate hikes “know not of what they speak.” He believes that a recession would be beneficial in the long term, claiming that “Only those who have lived with rampant inflation (including U.S. in 1970s) can truly understand the destructive impact on wealth of inflation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emphasizing that “The Fed should be slammed” for not raising interest rates by 300 basis points in early 2022, he stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The damage to personal wealth because of inflation is far more dangerous than a recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">paused</a> raising interest rates during its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in June after 10 consecutive rate increases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">more rate hikes</a> this year but at a &#8220;moderate pace.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Fed Chairman Powell on Rate Hikes</h2>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed the Fed’s hawkish stance on Wednesday during a central banker panel hosted by the European Central Bank in Sintra, Portugal. With the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting slated for July 25-26, Powell emphasized that the Fed is not done curbing inflation and hinted at the possibility of consecutive interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">paused</a> raising interest rates in June after 10 consecutive rate hikes.</p>
<p>“If you look at the data over the last quarter, what you see is stronger than expected growth, a tighter than expected labor market, and higher than expected inflation,” Powell detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>　That tells us that although policy is restrictive, it may not be restrictive enough and it has not been restrictive for long enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>Powell noted that Fed officials have not decided on the timing and magnitude of additional interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, he shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>　I wouldn’t take moving at consecutive meetings off the table at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>During an event held by Spain&#8217;s central bank in Madrid on Thursday, the Fed chair clarified: “We expect the moderate pace of interest rate decisions to continue.”</p>
<p>Last week, Powell said: &#8220;Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">has a long way to go</a>.&#8221; He further stated that a minimum of two more interest-rate hikes this year are likely necessary to steer inflation towards the Fed&#8217;s 2% target. The Fed chairman also rejected the possibility of a rate cut in the near future, <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-us-dollar-decline-will-be-far-greater-than-yellen-warns-fed-chair-powell-clearly-worried-about-financial-crisis/">stating</a> that while “it will be appropriate to cut rates at a time when inflation is coming down really significantly, we’re talking about a couple of years out.”</p>

Income derived from long-term investments in digital assets will also be relieved from healthcare taxes, the parliamentarians decided.</strong></p>
<h2>Investors in Slovakia to Pay 7% Tax on Income From Crypto Held More Than a Year</h2>
<p>Members of the National Council of Slovakia, the country’s unicameral legislature, have approved an amendment that will reduce the taxation of cryptocurrencies, local media <a href="https://e.dennikn.sk/minuta/3447018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. Income from crypto assets sold more than a year after their purchase will be taxed at 7%.</p>
<p>Thus, the tax rate for long-term crypto holdings will be lower than the regular income tax rates. Slovaks pay personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Slovakia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income tax</a> according to a progressive scale and the rate can be either 19% or 25%, for income exceeding a certain threshold.</p>
<p>The legislative proposal was submitted by the liberal Freedom and Solidarity party, the Democrats and the conservative Ordinary People and Independent Personalities party and backed by the We Are Family and Voice factions.</p>

<p>According to the updated law, gains from crypto investments will also be exempt from health taxes. Slovakia’s Ministry of Finance has estimated that the financial impact from the amendment will be around €30 million (almost $33 million) a year.</p>
<p>The tax exemptions come after earlier this month Slovak lawmakers sought to protect cash payments amid fears that the digital version of Europe’s common fiat currency, the euro, may eventually become the only means of payment across the eurozone.</p>
<p>The right to pay with cash for goods and services was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/right-to-pay-with-cash-enshrined-in-constitution-of-slovakia-amid-digital-euro-fears/">enshrined</a> in the country’s constitution through an amendment proposed by the right-wing and Euroskeptic We Are Family party. The latest legal changes will also exempt from taxation crypto payments for up to €2,400 ($2,600).</p>

<h2>Fednow System Launch Ignites CBDC Speculation</h2>
<p>The highly anticipated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/not-related-to-a-digital-currency-us-central-bank-addresses-concerns-over-fednow-payment-network/">Fednow system</a> is set to launch on July 1. Developed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, this payment system aims to provide &#x201C;24x7x365 settlement service&#x201D; and facilitate instantaneous payments. Extensive <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_faq.htm">information</a> on this subject has been released by the Fed, with significant involvement from the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Reserve&#x2019;s board members have conducted an evaluation and determined that the central bank is &#x201C;well positioned&#x201D; to tackle the nationwide implementation of instant payment infrastructure. It is worth noting that although Fednow offers immediate settlements, it does not adopt the blockchain-based approach.</p>

<p>The Fednow system utilizes <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/questions/does-fednow-use-blockchain">ISO 20022</a>, a worldwide standard for electronic message exchange between financial institutions established in 2004. ISO 20022 is widely employed by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/swift-is-experimenting-with-decentralized-technologies-to-allow-cbdc-interconnection/">SWIFT</a>, numerous financial organizations, and financial services. Its predecessor was ISO 15022. The ISO 20022 system adopted by the Fednow project functions as a shared financial language, enabling different banks, financial institutions, and systems to comprehend and exchange settlement information. It should be noted that the ISO 20022 system does not maintain a ledger for recording these settlements. Instead, relevant information is recorded and stored in databases or systems specific to the financial institution or organization involved.</p>

<p>Amidst conjecture and speculation, there are discussions about the potential evolution of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the Fednow system. However, in its current state, the infrastructure of Fednow is essentially comparable to the conventional payment rails utilized by existing financial incumbents. Is it possible for a CBDC to supplant it? Certainly, any system, including the Fednow and its underlying infrastructure, could be replaced by a different type of system in the future. At present, the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s Boston and New York branches have set in motion two distinct prototypes for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) &#x2014; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/atomic-settlement-new-york-fed-completes-first-phase-of-digital-dollar-experiment-called-project-cedar/">Project Cedar</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-bank-of-boston-mit-central-bank-digital-currency-research-open-source-code/">Project Hamilton</a>.</p>

<h2>Fednow and Ripple&#x2019;s Role Discussed as Fed Discloses &#x2018;Features and Enhancements Will Be Added in Future&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The list of prominent financial players embracing the Fednow system includes ACI Worldwide, Finzly, Jack Henry & Associates, Bryant Bank, Hawaiiusa Federal Credit Union, BMO Harris Bank, BNY Mellon, Bridge Community Bank, Citizens National Bank, Citi, Finastra, First Bank, Atlantic Community Bankers&#x2019; Bank, Capital One Financial, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and many others. Nearly 60 firms have received certification to utilize the Fednow instant payments system. All these firms are seamlessly connected to the extensive network of 4,844 insured commercial banks in the United States and can access the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s overnight banking rates.</p>

<p>Although the current implementation of the Fednow system does not utilize blockchain technology, there is speculation regarding the potential integration of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> or a stablecoin in the future. Some enthusiasts have drawn attention to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/apocalypse-fednow">remarks</a> on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) during his testimony before Congress on June 21. Powell stated, &#x201C;We would not support a central bank digital currency for individuals. If we did have a CBDC, it would be intermediated by banks.&#x201D; Supporters of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/w_thejazz/status/1674505875606896640?s=20">believe</a> that Ripple Labs or <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> itself <a href="https://twitter.com/xrpmickle/status/1674507141468549121?s=20">may be involved</a> in some capacity, while others go as far as to suggest potential long-term impacts on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s value.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the &#x201C;Economic Report of the President&#x201D; from the White House <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-administrations-economic-report-deems-crypto-assets-mostly-speculative-investment-vehicles/">emphasizes</a> that the Fednow system has &#x201C;the potential to realize many of the benefits that crypto asset developers have promised.&#x201D; In mid-March, the Fed explained that changes could be added to the Fednow system at any time. &#x201C;More features and enhancements will be added in future releases to continue supporting safety, resiliency and innovation in the industry as the Fednow network expands in the coming years,&#x201D; the U.S. central bank <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230315a.htm">disclosed</a>.</p>

<h2>Biden Wants to Eliminate Tax Loopholes for Crypto Traders</h2>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden talked about taxation for crypto traders during his economic policy speech dubbed &#8220;Bidenomics&#8221; in Chicago on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Does anyone here think the federal tax system is fair? Raise your hand,” Biden said, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>No matter how much money you make. We’re going to make it fair by eliminating loopholes for crypto traders, hedge fund managers.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We’re going to get billionaires to pay up a little bit, at least a minimum tax … No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher, a firefighter, or a cop,” he emphasized. “That’s the next phase of this fight: making the tax code fair for everyone, making the wealthy and the super-wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share, without raising taxes at all on the middle class.”</p>

<p>Many crypto proponents took to social media to comment on Biden&#8217;s speech. Gabor Gurbacs, advisor at investment management firm Vaneck, <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1674477262370926592">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reminder: The U.S. added $9 trillion in debt in the past ~3 years. The U.S. doesn&#8217;t have a revenue problem. It has a government spending problem. Not sure what President Biden is saying about eliminating tax loopholes for crypto traders. There are few to none.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ryan Selkis, founder &amp; CEO of crypto analytics firm Messari, <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1674513425626546179">wrote</a>: &#8220;At 80 years old, President Biden is one of the few people in D.C. who’s lived long enough to read through our 70,000-page tax code. But he’s also losing his marbles and seems confused: there are no &#8216;crypto trader&#8217; tax loopholes, and his policies are destroying capital gains anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although several major cryptocurrencies lost value in response to this news, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a> remains up by over 20% in just one day and more than 100% in a week.

<p>This recent upswing in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s value has prompted miners to direct significantly more hashrate toward the network. As of June 30, 2023, data reveals that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s hashrate stands at around <a href="https://archive.ph/2FYeO">5.6 exahash per second</a> (EH/s).</p>
<p>This is a substantial leap from May 11, 2023&#x2019;s rate of approximately 1.55 EH/s, which then saw a major spike on June 21st. Presently, on Friday, about 22 mining pools contribute hashpower to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, with Viabtc leading the charge with 603 petahash per second (PH/s).</p>

<p>Following Viabtc&#x2019;s contribution are Antpool, Zsolobid, F2pool, Pool Moscow, Trust Pool, and Poolin in descending order. Present statistics from Coin Dance reveal that as of June 30th, mining on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain yields a profit <a href="https://archive.ph/bjZoI">2.7% higher</a> than that of its SHA256 counterpart <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-595699 size-full" title="Bitcoin Cash Hashrate Gains Momentum: Miners Flock to BCH as Profitability Surges " src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Cash Hashrate Gains Momentum: Miners Flock to BCH as Profitability Surges " width="1280" height="300" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind-300x70.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind-1024x240.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind-768x180.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/coind.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Although <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s current hashrate is remarkably higher than it was a few weeks ago, it still falls short of the all-time high of 14.36 EH/s recorded at block height 622,407 on February 15, 2020. So far, the upward trend suggests that both the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s USD value and overall hashpower have endured, but only more time will confirm if this outcome will sustain.</p>

<h2>SEC Reportedly Finds Flaw in the Latest Slew of Spot Bitcoin ETF Applications</h2>
<p>Following Blackrock&#8217;s submission of an application for a spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), numerous companies swiftly followed suit and filed their own registrations for similar products. Despite the SEC&#8217;s approval of bitcoin futures ETFs, including a newly authorized leveraged option, the regulatory body has thus far refrained from granting approval to spot bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>According to insiders <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/sec-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-390336e8">cited</a> by Vicky Ge Huang of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the latest registrations submitted including Blackrock’s ETF are reported to fall short of meeting the SEC&#8217;s rigorous standards.</p>
<p>The SEC has reportedly revealed that the submitted applications for the ETFs are deemed inadequate, the WSJ report discloses. Allegedly, the SEC has communicated this to both Nasdaq and Cboe, the two firms responsible for filing the ETF registrations on behalf of Fidelity and Blackrock.</p>
<p>While a spokeswoman from Cboe informed the WSJ that they intend to revise and resubmit the registration to meet the SEC&#8217;s requirements, Nasdaq declined to comment, as disclosed by the reporter on Friday. As per the sources cited in Ge Huang&#8217;s report, “the filings aren’t sufficiently clear and comprehensive.”</p>
<p>An array of firms, including Blackrock, Bitwise, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-funds-joins-race-for-sec-approval-as-it-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Valkyrie</a>, Invesco, Fidelity, Ark Investment, and Wisdomtree, have already submitted their filings, signaling the growing interest in spot bitcoin ETFs.</p>

<p>Additionally, Grayscale Investments, the largest manager of digital currency assets worldwide, has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-investments-investors-help-convince-sec-approve-bitcoin-spot-etf/">striving to transform</a> the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected Grayscale&#8217;s application, prompting the firm to take <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-files-lawsuit-against-sec-over-spot-bitcoin-etf-rejection/">legal action</a> against the regulatory body.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s decision-making process sheds light on their concerns regarding market manipulation. When the SEC denied the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust last year, they <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2022/34-94080.pdf">cited the inability</a> to “prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts” or “protect investors” as the primary reasons for the denial.</p>
