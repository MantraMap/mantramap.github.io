										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto mixers or tumblers have recently become popular to increase privacy and security when using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Users may utilize crypto anonymously via crypto mixing services. But is it safe to use a crypto mixer for Bitcoin transactions? We&#8217;ll analyze crypto mixers&#8217; pros and cons in this article.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also see how to choose a reliable crypto mixer and what additional security measures are necessary when using one.</p>
<h2>Why Are Many People Interested in Crypto Mixers?</h2>
<p>Crypto mixers have become increasingly popular due to their privacy and security benefits. Crypto mixer services allow users to obscure the origin of their <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/investing-in-cryptocurrency-9-key-takeaways-for-efficient-investment/">cryptocurrency</a> funds by shuffling them through various other coins. This makes it virtually impossible to trace transactions back to their source.</p>
<p>Many see crypto mixers as a great way for individuals or businesses to remain anonymous when making transactions. Additionally, crypto mixers typically have legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>Among these use cases, we can mention preventing large transactions from driving down the price of a coin. Splitting down a large transaction is harder to notice and may help protect the asset&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>Crypto mixer services can also provide a level of security that is unavailable through normal cryptocurrency exchanges. Most exchanges need users to register and verify their identity, which puts their personal data in danger.</p>
<p>Crypto mixers help protect users with a safe way to exchange funds without revealing personal data. Their appeal also comes from the fact that they are often cheaper and faster than traditional exchanges.</p>
<h2>How Do Crypto Mixers Work?</h2>
<p>A crypto mixer is a third-party service breaking the link between the sender and receiver of cryptocurrency funds. It takes incoming coins from users and mixes them with other coins in its pool.</p>
<p>At this point, the mixer sends them to the designated wallet address, making it difficult to trace the coins’ origin. Users can also select their fee (usually a small percentage of the total coins sent).</p>
<p>Delaying the transaction further helps protect the anonymity of the sender&#8217;s identity and adds another layer of security. Most crypto mixers also offer a variety of other features, such as multi-signature wallets and escrow services.</p>
<h2>What Are the Benefits of Using a Crypto Mixer?</h2>
<p>We have identified several legit advantages associated with using a crypto mixer. The most obvious benefit is the ability to break the sender-receiver connection, helping to protect your identity and anonymity.</p>
<p>Other benefits include providing enhanced security against tracking and analytics tools hackers use to identify addresses and wallets. The trick makes it harder for anyone to track cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Finally, mixing allows you to maximize the use of your funds without having to invest in additional hardware or software. This way, users can avoid paying large transaction fees associated with withdrawing from exchanges or splitting large transactions.</p>
<h2>Are There Any Potential Risks Associated With Crypto Mixers?</h2>
<p>There are several potential risks associated with using crypto mixers. These include money losses due to technological issues, personal identification, and crypto mixer scams.</p>
<p>Specifically, users should know that some mixers may not mix the coins and could send them to a single address. Moreover, there is always the risk of technical issues, such as delays in transaction times or malfunctions of the mixer.</p>
<p>Do your homework and choose reliable crypto-mixing services with a great track record and customer assistance to reduce these dangers. You may also spread your funds across multiple mixers, reducing the risk of scams and identification.</p>
<p>Finally, check the terms and conditions of each mixer, especially before using it for any large transactions.</p>
<h2>Is It Legal to Use Crypto Mixers?</h2>
<p>While crypto mixers are not illegal worldwide, their usage may find strong regulation in certain countries.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mixing is a grey area in jurisdictions like the U.S. and Canada, with a laissez-faire approach alternated with sanctions. However, it is officially illegal in countries such as <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/trading-cryptocurrency-not-allowed-bangladesh-3120246">Bangladesh</a>.</p>
<p>In other regions, including the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26164/crypto-assets-new-rules-to-stop-illicit-flows-in-the-eu">European Union</a>, AML regulations require crypto transaction traceability, making using mixers legally complex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that crypto mixers aim to anonymize transactions, which means criminals may misuse them for illicit activities. Therefore, many governments have regulated the use of crypto mixers to protect against money laundering and other illicit activities.</p>
<p>In general, people need only to use crypto mixers in jurisdictions where they are legal. These regulations are rapidly evolving, so it&#8217;s important to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.</p>
<h2>How Can You Choose a Reliable and Trustworthy Crypto Mixer?</h2>
<p>Choosing a reliable and trustworthy crypto mixer is crucial for anyone looking to protect their digital privacy. Before selecting a platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do your due diligence and research the services offered.</li>
<li>Read reviews from past customers.</li>
<li>Check the company&#8217;s website for contact information.</li>
</ul>
<p>With objectivity, we&#8217;ve looked into three popular Bitcoin mixers that you may choose to consider when studying the topic. These are Yo!Mix, Coinomize, and Blindmixer.</p>
<p>Yo!Mix is a Bitcoin mixer featuring TOR and NoJs options, allowing users to remain anonymous when transacting. Yo!Mix offers services such as support for all addresses (SegWit, Taproot, Legacy, and Bech32) and <a href="https://yomix.io/">instant mixing</a> where applicable. You may use it to transfer at most 0.001 BTC with a minimum commission of 0.7%.</p>
<p>Coinomize is a mixer cutting the link between a BTC wallet address and any transactions made with the same coins. It uses <a href="https://coinomize.biz/">advanced technology</a> to ensure the anonymity of users&#8217; transactions.</p>
<p>When transacting, Coinomize hides the user&#8217;s identity by mixing their coins with other users&#8217; coins, concealing the funds’ origin. Additionally, it monitors all its transactions to remove any traces back to the original wallet address if necessary.</p>
<p>Blindmixer is a popular Bitcoin mixer known for its strong focus on privacy and security. The platform <a href="https://blindmixer.com/">uses</a> an advanced system to mix coins before sending them back to their original wallet addresses.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers low fees (from 100 SAT) with instantaneous transactions. The platform can also work in collaboration with existing e-commerce platforms.</p>
<h2>Can You Track Transactions that Used a Crypto Mixing Strategy?</h2>
<p>In many cases, it is possible to track transactions that have employed a crypto-mixing strategy. However, these strategies&#8217; complexity and technology can make this process difficult.</p>
<p>In order to identify mixed transactions, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2022/02/22/exclusive-austrian-programmer-and-ex-crypto-ceo-likely-stole-11-billion-of-ether/?sh=452be57a7f58">investigators</a> need to use sophisticated analysis techniques such as blockchain forensics and network clustering. These techniques analyze numerous data points such as transaction histories, wallet addresses, and IP addresses.</p>
<p>Investigators may also need to collaborate with other entities in the cryptocurrency space. Think, for instance, of an investigator working with exchanges and service providers to gain access to additional data sets.</p>
<p>If someone used a mixing service for a transaction, investigators might be able to identify the transaction through their records.</p>
<p>However, the general idea is that this process is possible but extremely time-consuming. Time consumption equals more money spent and forces investigators to consider the balance between costs and effort.</p>
<h2>What Additional Security Measures Should You Take When Using a Crypto Mixer?</h2>
<p>There are additional security measures to take when using a crypto mixer to maximize the security of your funds.</p>
<p>First, creating a new wallet address for each transaction is important. This will help prevent someone from tracing your transactions. Additionally, you should consider using a VPN when accessing the mixer to keep your IP address hidden.</p>
<p>You should also take into account the reputation of the mixer service. It is important to research and choose a crypto mixer tested by other users with reliable expertise.</p>
<p>Finally, it is essential to use strong passwords when setting up your account with the mixer. Even better, you may privilege a zero-logging provider of crypto mixers so that your info is never stored anywhere.</p>
<p>No matter what measures you take, there is always a risk when using cryptocurrencies. However, by taking these extra security measures when using a crypto mixer, you can reduce all the risks mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Conclusions: Is Using a Crypto Mixer for Bitcoin Transactions Safe?</h3>
<p>Using a crypto mixer for Bitcoin transactions may be complex in some countries, given the lack of uniform regulations. Therefore, it is important to understand the legal implications and risks of using a crypto mixer before opting for one.</p>
<p>Moreover, taking additional security measures can help ensure your funds remain secure when using a crypto mixer. This includes researching, using a VPN and strong passwords, and creating a new wallet address for each transaction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if the benefits of mixing Bitcoin outweigh the risks. In any case, ensure you understand all the regulations surrounding crypto mixers in your country before making a decision.</p>
<p>Taking these precautions can help ensure that your funds remain secure when using a crypto mixer for Bitcoin transactions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.arb.org.za/assets/section-iii-specific-categories-of-advertising-v2023.1.pdf">advertising regulatory body</a> (ARB) of South Africa has ordered influencers and providers of cryptocurrencies to explicitly state in their advertisements that buying cryptocurrencies carries the risk of capital loss.<br /><br />In its assessment from January 23, ARB noted that cryptocurrency advertisement providers must convey a fair message regarding the risks, advantages, and rate of return of the asset.<br /><br />According to ARB, advertisement vendors must explicitly declare that past success does not ensure future success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Advertisements must expressly and clearly state that investing in crypto assets may result in the loss of capital as the value is variable and can go up as well as down.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The regulator encouraged crypto asset providers to restrict credit-based <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cryptocurrency-market-recoups-1-trillion-mark-as-btc-surpasses-24000/">cryptocurrency</a> investment. According to the ARB report, influencers are required to give only genuine information regarding the crypto asset while they are pushing marketing.<br /><br />The South African regulator also asked cryptocurrency influencers and ambassadors to refrain from advising their audiences to trade or invest in any cryptocurrency asset.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A partner of Binance, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/signature-bank-pulls-back-from-crypto-transactions-below-100-000-binance-123012200061_1.html">Signature Bank</a>, has informed users of the exchange that it will no longer handle SWIFT transfers under $100,000.<br /><br />Another day, another Binance FUD story. This time, the breaking news is that Binance customers will no longer be able to send SWIFT payments under $100,000 through Signature Bank.<br /><br />The following was written by Binance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of our fiat banking partners, Signature Bank, has advised that it will no longer support any of its crypto exchange customers with buying and selling amounts of less than 100,000 USD as of February 1st, 2023. As a result, some individual users may not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to buy or sell crypto with/for USD for amounts less than 100,000 USD.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only 0.01% of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/jim-cramer-says-he-is-negative-on-xrp-ltc-doge-binance-announce-giveaway-of-1-btc-for-new-users/">Binance users</a> would be impacted by the removal of this service, the article claims. Binance announced that it would look for a solution to the problem.<br /><br />Since relatively few of Binance&#8217;s users use the SWIFT service, its withdrawal for smaller sums would not seem to have much of an effect on Binance.<br /><br />However, in this unsettling environment for cryptocurrencies, Signature Bank appears to be the most impacted firm. According to a Business Standard article, the bank was considering lowering its cryptocurrency business risk in the wake of the FTX crash.<br /><br />As it starts to withdraw from providing services to the cryptocurrency market, the bank reportedly stated in December that it planned to get as much as $10 billion in deposits from clients who own digital assets off of its books.<br /><br />The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued a warning to banks about the dangers of continuing to offer services to customers who are involved in cryptocurrencies, which led to the actions of Signature Bank.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethereum (ETH) surged on Saturday, climbing to its highest mark in last four months</li>
<li>At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,627</li>
<li>A total of 2.8 million ETH, or around $4.6 billion at the current exchange rate, have been taken out of circulation since the implementation of EIP-1559</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-sees-another-bull-favoring-element-as-on-chain-analytics-indicate-increased-blockchain-activity/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> surged on Saturday, climbing to its highest mark in the last four months. ETH/USD hit a high of $1,680 earlier before a slight retreat. At the time of writing, ETH was up 0.20% at $1,627. The EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) 1559 protocol has been actively burning ETH at a tremendous rate since it was first introduced in August 2021. According to EIP-1559, a percentage of every NFT deal, yield scheme, and even straightforward token transfer is destroyed. All of it is being burned. A total of 2.8 million ETH, or around $4.6 billion at the current exchange rate, have been taken out of circulation since the implementation of EIP-1559. According to Ultrasound Money, the Ethereum protocol has destroyed more than 16,364 ETH in the past seven days at an estimated pace of 1.62 ETH per minute. Due to the burn mechanism, more ETH is being burned than is being issued to miners. Since EIP 1559, supply growth has now decreased to -1.06% annually. As a result, Ethereum becomes more deflationary than Bitcoin.<br /><br /><strong>Key levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $2,300, $2,000, $1,700<br />Support Levels: $1,500, $1,300, $1,000</p>

Ethereum (ETH) price action closed slightly flat after mild drops over the end of the prior week, which might culminate in a Doji close on Sunday. Despite showing hesitation, the Doji pattern may portend a positive reversal in the coming sessions. <br /><br />However, for the time being, trader sentiment is divided. With a solid bullish close over $1,650, ETH might rise above $1,700 to the resistance level of $2,000. This may pave the way for ETH/USD to return to the $3,000 region. Alternatively, if the ETH price falls from current levels, it is expected to revert toward moving averages (MA 50 and MA 200) around $1,450 and $1,350.</p>

<p>ETH/USD has been consolidating in recent days, with the drop to $1,603 creating a base for the lows. Ethereum price rose over the $1,600 support level. The bullish picture remains intact, as evidenced by the RSI and the SMAs&#8217; upside turn. Their upward inclination may also imply that the current course will last a little longer. If buyers can break over the $1,700 resistance level, the $2,000 level could be the next objective.<br /><br />A decrease, on the other hand, might be halted merely by the moving averages of 50 and 200, which are around $1,580 and $1,350, respectively. To summarize, ETH&#8217;s newfound bullish surge may continue if the price closes above the $1,700 level. However, short-term profit-taking may occur to calm the RSI, making corrective drops more likely.</p>

<li>Bitcoin (BTC) is leading the weekly gains</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-btc-quells-downside-move-indicators-and-market-participants-have-this-to-say/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> is leading the weekly gains among the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market cap as its price soared 11.2%. Bitcoin rose as high as $23,375 on Saturday, per Trading View data, and at a current price of $22,983, it has increased nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. The last time that Bitcoin rose near current levels was in August 2022, well before November’s implosion of crypto exchange FTX sent the price of the biggest cryptocurrency in market valuation down below the $16,000 mark. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has risen as the large &#8220;whale tier&#8221; group of addresses holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC has accumulated 64,638 BTC worth $1.46 billion in the last 15 days, according to Onchain analytics firm Santiment. In a related development, crypto exchange Binance saw the biggest amount of hourly inflows since the FTX collapse on January 20. About 6800 BTC entered the exchange yesterday, followed by withdrawals of approximately 5000 BTC.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $30,000, $27,000, $25,000<br />Support Levels: $21,500, $18,500, $16,500</p>

<p>BTC gained ground after an early rebound from its January 18 low of $20,370. Although bullish continuation requires confirmation and a downside correction cannot be ruled out, the RSI is fixed northwards over 80 may indicate that buying forces continue to dominate in the near term. However, traders are expecting sideways action in the coming trading sessions as they wait for a full breakout.<br /><br />A continuation of the price rise for Bitcoin (BTC) could finally reach and test the resistance of $25,000 ahead of the $27,000 level. The psychological zone of $30,000 may be another hurdle for the bulls. Alternatively, a price decrease would test the daily moving average (MA 200) near $20,000 before returning to the current range&#8217;s floor of $22,000.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-trying-to-extend-consolidation-after-weeks-recovery-attempt/">BTC/USD</a> is consolidating just near the $23,000 mark, establishing a base for next move higher. Bulls had provided the impetus in prior sessions, rising far above the 4-hour MA 50 ($21,500) and on to the $23,000 mark. The MA 50 and 200 have turned upside and show positive momentum, while the RSI, which is now in the bullish zone, is in overbought territory.<br /><br />The BTC/USD pair may find immediate resistance near the $25,000 horizontal barrier. The pairs&#8217; climb higher may cause the price to retest the $30,000 level in the near term, and if that level is breached, traders may see a run-up into known bullish territory, with $40,000 as a potential goal. Alternatively, a push below the moving averages could cause the BTC price to fall.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/theta-price-analysis-theta-consolidates-ahead-of-major-move-amid-upcoming-tdrop-token-airdrop-to-stakers/">THETA</a>, the native token of the Theta network, is once again trading above the $1 mark. At the time of writing, THETA was up 12% in the last 24 hours and up 11.72% since the past week as optimism rises for the bulls&#8217; comeback in 2023. Theta Labs has announced the alpha release of Theta EdgeStore, a crucial part of its 2023 roadmap, building on the release of the EdgeStore demo and Theta Video API Edge Ingestors. Theta EdgeStore, a new component of the Theta Edge Node software, is run by tens of thousands of users around the globe and acts as an append-only, content-addressing, decentralized key/value storage network for the permanent web. While Theta Edge Nodes already support decentralized streaming and encoding or transcoding, with the addition of decentralized storage, the Edge Node hopes to offer a complete end-to-end decentralized service for video streaming, as well as any other type of file transfer or streaming. Theta anticipates a wide array of decentralized applications to be built on top of the Theta EdgeStore, such as permanent storage for the digital assets of NFTs like images and videos, among other use cases.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $3.50, $2.55, $1.50<br />Support Levels: $0.98, $0.70, $0.50</p>

<p>Following the crypto market rebound, THETA has made a robust comeback, with price action at the end of the week extending the strong rebound. The gains lifted the THETA/USD above the psychological level of $1.0. The current rebound is supported by near-term oscillators, with the RSI moving into overbought territory. If the rally continues, today&#8217;s high of $1.1031 around the MA 200 could serve as immediate resistance.<br /><br />Only a significant breakout above this resistance could rekindle the bullish bias beyond the $1.50 zone. The closing gap between the MAs will be closely monitored in the following sessions. Support levels are at the daily moving average (MA 50) at $0.85, which remains vulnerable to bearish pressure. If these levels are closely violated, there is a chance that the slide will be more severe and reach as low as $0.50.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/theta-price-analysis-consolidation-targets-breakout-on-theta-usd-ahead-of-june-30-mainnet-3-0-launch/">THETA price</a> surged at the close of the week on Saturday, January 21, towards the $1.1031 area, after briefly consolidating below $1.000 to find support close to the $0.9800 low, from which it later recovered. Since then, THETA has bounced back to trade above the $1.0 level.<br /><br />A breakout to the upside above the $1.1500 high would pave the way for the round figures of $2.0 achieved in May. On the other hand, a new wave of losses could stall close to the $1.00 psychological level before the MA 50. After the latest low at $0.9826, a bearish break may seek scope for a test of the MA 50.</p>

<p>This weekend&#8217;s crypto market rebound got another jolt on Saturday as <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-past-20-dive-a-correction-or-a-crash/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> blasted off to highs last seen in August 2022, with altcoins such as Aptos, Optimism, and Decentraland’s MANA also posting sizable gains.<br /><br />Bitcoin rose as high as $23,375 on Saturday, per Trading View data, and at a current price of $22,948, it has increased nearly 9% over the past 24 hours. The last time that Bitcoin rose near current levels was in August 2022, well before November’s implosion of crypto exchange FTX sent the price of the biggest cryptocurrency in market valuation down below the $16,000 mark.<br /><br />Saturday’s continued rally pushes Bitcoin’s seven-day gains to 20%, with a 34% jump recorded over the last 30 days. Bitcoin is nearly 68% below its all-time high price of over $69,000 reached in November 2021, but the recent gains show a recovery in the crypto market after a bearish 2022.<br /><br />Overall, the cryptocurrency market valuation has seen a 6.76% growth over the past 24 hours, with cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL, 18.40%), Tezos (XTZ, 13.04%), Ravencoin (RVN, 10.01%), and a handful of other altcoins posting significant gains.<br /><br />Aptos (APT) however, is skyrocketing compared to most of the rest of the crypto market on Saturday as it is up a whopping 60% to trade at $12.52 at press time.</p>
<h2>JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon Calls Bitcoin “A Hyped-Up Fraud</h2>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/jpmorgan-tests-blockchain-based-collateral-settlement-system/">JPMorgan</a> Chase CEO Jamie Dimon calls bitcoin <em>“a hyped-up fraud.”</em> The executive queried the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply cap, saying that he was expecting an image of bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto to pop up and laugh when bitcoin’s supply hits 21 million coins.<br /><br />The CEO of global investment bank JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, who has always been vocal in his criticism of bitcoin cryptocurrency and not the blockchain reiterated his skepticism about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Thursday by saying <em>‘’Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It’s a pet rock’’</em>.<br /><br />While he is positive about blockchain technology, the JPMorgan boss casts a negative light on cryptocurrencies: <em>“Crypto itself doesn’t do anything. It’s a pet rock.”</em> He then told the news outlet:<em> “I don’t care about bitcoin so we should drop this subject.”</em> He said.</p>

<p>According to reports, the S<a href="https://stellar.org/blog/representing-blockchain-on-the-commodity-futures-trading-commissions-global-market-advisory-committee">tellar Development Foundation</a> will join a new advisory council for the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In the new entity, the SDF will be in charge of blockchain and digital assets, advising the CFTC on these concerns.<br /><br />Along with Stellar representatives, officials from the Chamber of Digital Commerce, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/us-sec-opens-investigation-into-decentralized-crypto-exchange-developer-uniswap-labs/">Uniswap Labs,</a> and CoinFund will be on the side of the new digital economy. However, Stellar will be solely responsible for the blockchain&#8217;s direction.<br /><br />J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock have also joined the Global Market Advisory Committee, indicating Stellar&#8217;s optimism for beneficial collaboration with traditional financial market representatives. Stellar (XLM), as a decentralized cross-border money transfer provider in particular, wishes to give special attention to the issue of remittances and stablecoins. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ripple-rival-stellar-releases-impressive-annual-results/">SDF</a> intends to bring up the topic of stablecoins on the digital asset market and their uses in real life, including humanitarian relief, as part of their Stellar Aid Assist initiative on this occasion.<br /><br />Ironically, the event seems almost the exact opposite of what is going on in the other corner between Ripple and the SEC. It turns out that while Stellar, together with the traditional finance giants, oversees crypto policy under the wing of the CFTC, Ripple continues to fight the SEC in court. We have two competing companies, two competing regulators, and two opposing situations.</p>

<p>The SEC charged <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/nexo-crypto-lending-platform-adds-bitcoin-cash-support/">Nexo</a> on Thursday with failing to register its Earn Interest Product retail crypto asset lending product. Nexo agreed to pay a $45 million penalty to satisfy the charges brought against the company. Nexo has agreed to pay the SEC $22.5 million in fines, as well as state authorities $22.5 million in fines. <br /><br />Nexo faced regulatory scrutiny for its EIP in September 2022 from eight states in the United States, including California, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Washington, and Vermont. State officials said that Nexo sold its products without registering them as securities and without properly disclosing them to customers.<br /><br />According to the SEC, Nexo began providing its EIP in June 2020, allowing US investors to surrender their crypto holdings in exchange for a promise of interest. After the SEC filed similar accusations against another company in February 2022, Nexo discontinued marketing its product to new investors. According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-11">press release</a> issued by the SEC:<br /><br />According to the SEC’s order, in or around June 2020, Nexo began to offer and sell the EIP in the United States. The EIP allowed U.S. investors to tender their crypto assets to Nexo in exchange for Nexo’s promise to pay interest.<br /><br />The order states that Nexo marketed the EIP as a means for investors to earn interest on their crypto assets, and Nexo exercised its discretion to use investors’ crypto assets in various ways to generate income for its own business and to fund interest payments to EIP investors. The order finds that the EIP is a security and that the offer and sale of the EIP did not qualify for an exemption from SEC registration. Therefore, Nexo was required to register its offer and sale of the EIP, which it failed to do.<br /><br />Despite the SEC and state regulators&#8217; claims, Nexo is also the focus of a large-scale investigation in Bulgaria for suspicions of money laundering, computer fraud, tax evasion, and other offenses. Over 300 police officers searched the company&#8217;s offices in Bulgaria.<br /><br />Nexo also sued the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) for denying its application to become a virtual asset service provider (VASP) in the jurisdiction. Nexo&#8217;s plan to sue CIMA comes after the regulator denied the lender&#8217;s registration as a VASP due to regulatory and enforcement concerns. <br /><br />According to CIMA, <em>&#8220;Nexo posed a risk to market confidence, consumer protection and the reputation of the Islands as a financial centre.&#8221;</em> Nexo is requesting that CIMA&#8217;s judgment be reversed and that the lender be granted VASP registration.</p>

<p>After falling the previous day, Bitcoin rose once more to a comfortable level substantially above $21,000. The action caused bitcoin to rise to intraday highs of $22,456, which was last reached in September 2022.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-soars-to-new-heights-with-10-increase-as-miners-return/">lead cryptocurrency</a> was recently trading at over $22,276, up 5.76% over the previous 24 hours, as investors ignored the most recent consequences of the disgraced crypto exchange FTX and conflicting economic statistics. BTC kept following the more optimistic course throughout 2023.<br /><br />The Crypto market is showing a decoupling from equities. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1% this week, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) also fell by more than a percentage point. Equities markets also continued to lose ground this week.<br /><br />Investors struggled to square declines in housing starts and building permits with the publication of jobs data showing that the strong job market had not cooled, which showed a 15,000 weekly fall in Americans applying for unemployment. <br /><br />The former suggested that the economy is not cooling sufficiently to appease central bankers, which is bad news for cryptocurrency, while the latter implied the opposite.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hbar-price-analysis-what-to-watch-in-hbar-as-it-ticks-higher-hedera-set-to-launch-its-first-defi-project/">Hedera (HBAR)</a> is up 33% in the last 24 hours at $0.076 and up 51% in the last seven days. Hedera has been named the winner of The Innovation Awards in the category “Innovation in DLT, Blockchain, and Crypto” per a Dmagazine report. <br /><br />Avery Dennison, one of the most important material sciences companies in the world, confirmed Hedera’s attendance at the World Economic Forum this year. The same company is currently one of Hedera’s partners, which means the network is already attracting partners that are aligned with the WEF’s efficiency and sustainability plans.<br /><br />Over the past seven days, the Hedera network has set new milestones, processing more than 323 million transactions, averaging 535 TPS. It also reached a new throughput ATH of 8,061 TPS while Achieving transaction finality in 3.56 seconds (avg).</p>
<h2>Here Is What Analysts Say About the Bullish Scenario</h2>
<p>The resilience of bitcoin in the wake of the Genesis bankruptcy news didn&#8217;t come as a surprise to traders. The GBTC discount immediately widened again as the market seems to have been anticipating the Genesis bankruptcy filing for the previous 48 hours. <br /><br /><em>&#8221;Genesis declaring bankruptcy removes a cloud of doom from the market, allowing cryptocurrency investors to concentrate on the fundamentals,&#8221;</em> Markus Thielen, head of strategy and research at cryptocurrency services provider Matrixport stated.<br /><br /><em>&#8220;In 2023, there is a good chance for a breakthrough that might start a new bull market. The development of layer 2 solutions, ZK-rollups, privacy solutions, and many other emerging cryptographic capabilities excite us,&#8221;</em> Bitwise&#8217;s analysts under the direction of Chief Investment Officer Matthew Hougan noted.</p>
