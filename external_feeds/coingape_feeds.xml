The bullish rally is currently challenging a monthly resistance of $5, offering further growth potential for coin holders. However, can buyers undermine the overhead supply pressure to reclaim higher prices?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $5 resistance breakout may encourage the ongoing rally for a 20% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bullish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMA would increase the possibility for uptrend continuation </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the Convex Finance Token is $16.3 Million, indicating a 67.5% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/HdgsaXMN.png" alt="Convex Finance Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tradingview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the recent recovery, the convex finance coin pierced multiple resistances, which offered suitable support for buyers to sustain higher levels. Moreover, this bullish rally, backed by evident growth in volume action, indicates a sustained recovery in CVX price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 14, the coin price gave a bullish breakout from the resistance trendline of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>. This bullish breakout from the. Six-month-long wedge pattern indicates an early sign of trend reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, On January 17th, CVX price showcased a failed attempt to break the monthly resistance of $5. The long wick rejection attached to the daily candle indicates the sellers are aggressively defending this level.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/education/explained-what-is-physical-nft-and-how-to-sell-physical-items-as-nft/">Explained: What is Physical NFT? and How to Sell Physical Items as NFT</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, a daily closing about the $5 resistance will accelerate the bullish momentum for further recovery. The post-breakout rally may drive prices 20% higher to hit the $6 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if overhead selling pressure persists, the prices could remain below $5, which could increase the possibility of a bearish reversal.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> surged into the overbought region, indicating traders have overextended the buying activity. The indicator value of 85% accentuates that a price correction is needed to stabilize the bullish trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> during the potential retracement, the reclaimed EMAs ( 20, 50, and 100) would offer significant support to CVX price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curve Finance Coin Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $4.9</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $5 and $6</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $4.4 and $3.7</span></li>
</ul>

Morgan &amp; her husband Lichtenstein are at the center of a bizarre crypto fraud where they succumbed to arrests on suspicion of embezzling <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> worth $4.5 billion from a Hong Kong-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a>, Bitfinex.</p>
<h2>Razzlekhan&#8217;s New Job</h2>
<p>In order to work three days a week from the employer&#8217;s New York office, Morgan has requested the judge to relax the restrictions of her home confinement. Her attorney, Eugene Gorokhov, stated in the document filed on Tuesday in Washington that the government has no objections to the suggested revision.</p>
<p>According to Gorokhov&#8217;s <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-17/wall-street-rapper-charged-in-crypto-heist-lands-new-tech-job#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow">statement</a> in the petition, a job offer was made to Morgan in the position of growth marketing and business development specialist. And, even though the government is aware of the identity of the employer, Morgan requested anonymity for the sake of her own safety and to safeguard the identity of the employer as well.</p>
<p>While speaking on the continual cyber threats received by Morgan after the fraud came to light, he was quoted to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>That information is not noted in this public filing due to the fact that Ms. Morgan has been subject to disparaging comments and harassment on social media as a result of the intense media coverage of this case.</p></blockquote>

<h2>119K Bitcoins Stolen</h2>
<p>Back in 2016&#8211;even before 2017&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ico-initial-coin-offering/">ICO</a> boom period &amp; its following number of scams&#8211;a <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitfinex/">Bitfinex</a> hack saw 119,754 Bitcoins siphoned off in total; the heist was estimated to be around $71 million at the time before the value of cryptocurrencies surged. According to information provided by the DOJ, more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions were used to transfer the stolen Bitcoin and send it directly to a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">crypto wallet</a>, that later distributed the funds between Morgan and Lichtenstein.</p>
<p>On February 8, 2022, Razzlekhan, the self-proclaimed &#8220;Crocodile of Wall Street,&#8221; was taken into custody in Manhattan for her alleged connection to the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> theft. Following the development, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/u-s-department-of-justice/">Department of Justice</a> hailed it as a &#8220;major blow to cyber criminals looking to exploit crypto&#8221; and announced that it had seized Bitcoins worth $3.6 billion, making it the largest financial seizure in its history. Morgan, who has pled not guilty to the accusations if proven wrong can face up to 20 years of jail time.</p>

This reversal signs in price action and oversold outlook from technical indicator project debate coin price is likely to witness a minor pullback. Here’s how you may handle the upcoming pullback in <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bearish reversal from the $21500 resistance may tumble the coin by 14%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reclaimed EMAs(20, 50, and 100) could offer significant support during the a bearish pullback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $25.5 Billion, indicating a 5% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/i/iw5UihzW.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">on January 12th, the. Bitcoin price gave a massive Breakout from the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a> of the daily time frame chart. The post-breakout rally drove 15% higher to hit the $21,500 resistance. However, in the last three days, the daily charge shows higher price rejection from the mentioned level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These failed attempts from coin buyers to surpass the $21500 ceiling indicate a higher possibility of bearish reversal. In addition, the exponential recovery in the Bitcoin price since January 1st could use a temporary correction to stabilize the bullish trend. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the suffering Bitcoin mining industry continues to distress coin holders on a fundamental level. Moreover, the on-chain data provider Cryptoquant recently highlighted the Bitcoin mining difficulty had reached a new ATH of 37.59 Trillion amid the recent adjustment. If this progress prolongs in mining difficulty, the BTC price could struggle to maintain a sustained rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a potential pullback, the BTC holders should keep an eye on the following support levels, as said, could resume the prior recovery. Therefore, a reversal from the $21500 ceiling could dump the largest cryptocurrency by market cap to $20350, $19000, or $18200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakout from the falling wedge initiates a bullish rally to the higher swing top of the pattern, which is $25000 for Bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band</strong>: the rising BTC price constantly hitting the upper band of the indicator suggests the ongoing rally is aggressive for the time being, and thus a minor pullback is required to stabilize it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD</strong>: the large gap between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line indicate the BTC price is under buyers&#8217; control.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: 21207</span></li>

The name is taken from the folklore surrounding Robin Hood, who being an outcast, used to live in the forest of <em>&#8220;Sherwood&#8221;</em>.<b> </b>The new media organization would serve as a source for news and information pertaining to financial markets, economics, business and technology; as well as the culture of money.</p>
<h2>Robinhood&#8217;s Foray Into Media</h2>
<p>The company will be an extension of Robinhood&#8217;s brand and a means of attracting new customers, building on the success of Robinhood&#8217;s daily markets and business newsletter, Snacks. Headed by Joshua Topolsky, the founder and former Editor-in-chief of The Verge, the publication will soon become the new home of Snacks as well as other new products that will cover finance &amp; money holistically; along with associated subjects including <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>, technology, and geopolitics. Topolsky was previously involved in the establishment of the parent business Vox Media and served as the Chief Digital Content Officer at Bloomberg before leaving for Sherwood.</p>
<p>While speaking on the new development, Topolsky was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The next generation looks at money and the markets through an entirely new lens, they live at a different speed — and they want something more substantive in their diet.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></em></p>
<p>Joining in as the editor-in-chief and president of Sherwood Media, Topolsky further stated that he&#8217;s ecstatic to be a member of a team that has the unique opportunity, position, and perspective to construct a &#8220;news organization for the next wave&#8221;. And, while Robinhood will provide funding to assist the establishment of the outlet, the new president at Sherwood intends to develop business opportunities for the editorial items he is developing.</p>
<h2>How Does Robinhood Benefit?</h2>
<p>Beginning this year, Topolsky intends to fill dozens of open positions at the new company, including those for reporters, editors and content makers for social media. He plans to introduce new email items across various business and finance verticals in addition to Snacks. According to him, creating specialized newsletters on well-known corporations like Tesla and Disney would be one of his key initiatives to being with.</p>
<p>In 2019, Robinhood took its first step into the media sector when it acquired MarketSnacks, a startup that produced podcasts &amp; newsletters and was home to Robinhood&#8217;s current Snacks newsletter. Before Sherwood was established, Snacks did not report news about Robinhood in order to prevent any real or perceived conflict of interest. However, this time according to Topolsky,  Sherwood would cover its parent trading platform &#8220;where and when it makes sense&#8221; along with mandatory disclosures. With media being utilized as a potent customer acquisition and branding strategy, Robinhood looks to harness the power of Sherwood in capturing a larger market presence.</p>
<p>As things stand, the share price of Robinhood (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD/" rel="nofollow">HOOD</a>) is currently trading at around $9.41, which represents a 1% uptick in the day, in contrast to its 11% gain in the past five days.</p>

Amid the ongoing recovery sentiment in the market, an upside breakout from the pattern&#8217;s neckline resistance will release the bullish momentum. Here&#8217;s how this continuation pattern may influence the future price of the Terra classic coin.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the ascending triangle pattern bolsters a steady growth in bullish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the pattern’s neckline will trigger a directional rally for LUNC</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $124.3 Million, indicating a 47.7% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/rwWkG0Y5.png" alt="Terra Classic Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the majority of major cryptocurrencies have experienced exponential growth since 1st January 2023, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-classic/">Terra classic coin</a> price continues to struggle in uncertainty. For over two months, this altcoin has traveled in a sideways trend, struggling to surpass the $0.000185 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the lateral walk, the LUNC price has shown multiple failed attempts to break this resistance, indicating the sailors are aggressively defending this level. Moreover, the numerous higher price rejection candles present at the $0.000185 ceiling accentuate the intense supply pressure from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the ongoing recovery in the crypto market, an ascending trendline has emerged, which gradually supports the LUNC price to climb higher levels. Anyhow, a rising trendline and stiff resistance reveal the formation of an ascending triangle pattern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a bullish continuation pattern, the Terra classic coin holds a higher possibility of a $0.00185 resistance breakout. Thus, this bullish breakout may bolster coin prices to escape the ongoing uncertainty and an entry opportunity for interested buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential target for this technical setup from the breakout point is 38% higher to the $0.000258 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown from the support trendline will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index</strong>: a steady rise in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> reflects the rising bullish momentum in the Terra classic coin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the rising 20-and-50-day EMA slopes are on the verge of a bullish crossover, offering additional confirmation for the upcoming rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra Classic Coin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.000177</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ongoing recovery rally piercing another crucial resistance level of $0.057, the coin buyers obtain a higher footing to extend a bullish recovery. The GALA price maintains a strong sense of recovery by using each resistance breakout as a stepping stone to reach higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Gaming token jumped 17% from the recently breached $0.0467, indicating a strong follow-up of the recent breakout. Thus, with sustained buying, the coin price should rise 6.5% to hit the next resistance of the $0.057 mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing about the mentioned resistance will offer another entry opportunity for interested traders and higher gains in the coming days. In theory, the wedge pattern breakout has set a potential target to the higher swing top of the pattern, which for the GALA price is $0.09.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, on January 14th, the daily candle showed long wick rejection near $0.056-$0.053, indicating the prices are currently wavering at a high supply zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, the trader should be cautious of $0.57 resistance as any more rejection sign at this level could increase the chance of a bearish reversal. Anyhow, after such a massive price rally is minor pullback would be healthy to maintain a sustained</span></p>

However, he remains optimistic about technological developments in the market and an uptick in the crypto adoption rate in 2023 due to progress in regulatory frameworks and rules.</p>
<h2>More Insolvencies in 2023, But Outlook Remains Optimistic: Circle CEO</h2>
<p>During the World Economic Forum in Davos, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire on January 16 <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1615308180137086976" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said </a>crypto contagion will continue to impact the crypto market in 2023 as crypto companies and businesses will struggle to raise capital or survive.</p>
<p>He believes heightened scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement agencies put more challenges on some players and may cause distress for the crypto market. However, he remains optimistic about the crypto market in 2023, with regulations positioning cryptocurrencies in focus.</p>
<p>While regulating the crypto market will take time, the crypto market will learn to differentiate between good players and bad players.</p>
<p>Jeremy Allaire asserts that 2023 is about innovations happening on Layer-1 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a>, Layer-2 scaling solutions, and new technologies for privacy, security, and identity. The crypto market will not see technological innovations slowing down.</p>
<p>Commenting on the impact of USDC on the economy and markets, Allaire mentioned the release of the &#8220;State of the USDC Economy&#8221; report. The report highlights <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/usd-coin-usdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD Coin</a>&#8216;s (USDC) prospects in the payments industry and becoming part of the M2 money supply in the future.</p>
<p>According to the report, Circle backs USDC with U.S. dollar assets, with 80% reserves held in 3-month U.S. Treasuries and 20% in cash held at banks. By January&#8217;s end, Circle will move reserves into the Circle Reserve Fund, which is 100% owned by Circle, managed by BlackRock, and custodied by The Bank of New York Mellon.</p>
<h2>Crypto Regulations in 2023</h2>
<p>Major markets such as the U.S. need statutory definitions of digital assets to provide regulatory clarity for the crypto market. The U.S. Congress will proceed with signing several digital assets bills in 2023, resolving the crypto jurisdiction dispute between the SEC and the CFTC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, European Union will take the final decision on the Markets in the Crypto-Assets (MiCA) bill in April. However, the MiCA rules will not come into effect until 2024, but will increase crypto adoption in the region.</p>

However, the final vote will now have to wait until April.</p>
<p>An EU Parliament spokesperson told that the delay is &#8220;technical&#8221; and was most likely brought on by problems with translating the nearly 400-page document into the 24 official languages of the union.</p>
<h2><b>European Union Parliamentary Session got postponed</b></h2>
<p>The EU postponed the vote to February 2023 in November 2022. However, they feared that technical difficulties in the lengthy text would cause the licensing regime&#8217;s anticipated 2024 implementation to be delayed.</p>
<p>Following the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/is-ftx-crash-an-end-of-crypto-how-this-debacle-unfolded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure of FTX</a></strong>, EU officials stated that MiCA would have prevented such a collapse. However, the law contains a significant flaw that allows organizations like FTX, to continue serving EU clients without additional regulation.</p>
<p>The nearly 400-page text still needs to be officially approved by legislators. Also, the national governments that make up the EU&#8217;s Governing Council. Although European legislators have in principle approved the law, which also specifies reserve requirements for <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/stablecoin-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stablecoins</a></strong>, it has not yet received their official approval. All 27 of the member countries will be directly impacted by the law, but national regulators will largely be in charge of its implementation and interpretation.</p>
<h3><b>French Policymakers pushing for mandated crypto firms</b></h3>
<p>There have been other regulations delayed besides MiCA. Additionally, the same voting session in April will now be used to pass the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR). However, which is intended to be implemented concurrently with MiCA. The TFR mandates that all cryptographic transfers contain know-your-customer data for both the recipient and the receiver.</p>
<p>Ahead of MiCA, some European nations are pushing for stricter <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto regulation</a></strong>. However, as a result of the volatile year in the cryptocurrency markets. For example, French policymakers and central bankers are pushing for the mandatory licensing of <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/top-7-crypto-marketing-firms-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto firms</a></strong> in 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/airdrop-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airdrops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are one of the most common yet cunning tricks. Companies typically airdrop cryptocurrencies (or money) into a user’s wallet address in exchange for some activity, such as a new product launch, a new coin offering, or for promoting a brand. Crypto phishing scammers create elaborate clones of the profiles, websites, and emails of the company they wish to spoof; and people unknowingly get trapped. In July 2022, Uniswap, a popular decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, lost close to $8 million worth of <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> in a sophisticated phishing attack. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2>Malevolent browser bookmarks</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookmark managers are another phishing strategy you should be careful of. In 2022, many crypto scammers inserter JavaScript code into bookmarks through phishing pages and potentially gained access to a Discord user’s information and took over the permissions of a project owner’s account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2>Whaling</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whaling crypto attacks are directed toward senior executives. Even though the main goal of whaling is the same as any other kind of phishing crypto attack, the method used to pull this trick is a lot subtler. Tricks such as fake links and malicious URLs aren’t helpful in this instance, as criminals are attempting to imitate senior staff. Last year, toy giant Mattel fell victim to a whaling attack after a top finance executive received an email requesting a money transfer from a fraudster impersonating the new CEO. The company almost lost $3 million as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2>eth_sign phishing trick</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-scams-watch-out-for-these-5-scams-in-2022-23/">crypto phishing scam</a> allows a hacker to gain access to your private key and sign any transaction they choose. After connecting your wallet to a scam site, a signature application box may pop up with a red warning from MetaMask. After signing, attackers gain access to your signature, allowing them to construct any data and ask you to sign it through eth_sign.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2>Vishing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be familiar with the term “Honey trap”, right? Well, Voice phishing or vishing is a lot similar to it but instead of sweet talking you into the trap, </span><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-crypto-rug-pull-its-meaning-and-how-to-avoid-rug-pulls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scammers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> create a sense of panic and urgency. A cybercriminal calls a phone number and creates a heightened sense of urgency that makes a person take an action against their best interests. These calls normally occur around stressful times and the recipient can be tricked into giving away personal information.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="900" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/17174648/bank-crypto-shutterstock-1019x573-1.png" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="silvergate loss" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>Silvergate Capital, a bank that specializes in virtual currencies, reported a loss of $1.05 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022; although at the same time a year earlier, it had reported a profit of $18.4 million. As a result of a string of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bankruptcy/">high-profile bankruptcies</a> that shook the crypto industry and prompted a deluge of withdrawals at the bank, Silvergate lost $33.16 on a per-share basis, compared to a profit of 66 cents a year prior.</p>
<h2>Silvergate&#8217;s Net Loss At $1 Billion</h2>
<p>The California-based bank reported that it suffered large losses in deposits over the course of the quarter &amp; that it has taken measures to shore up its liquidity, including laying off almost 40% of its workforce. According to Silvergate&#8217;s official statement, the company anticipates a prolonged period of reduced deposits across the broader <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>.</p>
<p>Silvergate CEO Alan Lane was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>While we are taking decisive actions to navigate the current environment, our mission has not changed. We believe in the digital asset industry. To that end, we are committed to maintaining a highly liquid balance sheet with a strong capital position.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></em></p>
<p>According to Silvergate&#8217;s report, the company sold $5.2 billion worth of debt securities during the quarter and reported a loss of $751.4 million on the transaction. In addition to this, it reported an impairment charge of 134.5 million dollars related to the 1.7 billion dollars worth of securities that it plans to sell during the current quarter in order to lower its borrowings.</p>
<h2>The FTX Contagion</h2>
<p>The collapse of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> precipitated a run on Silvergate Capital Corp., which required the bank to sell assets at a considerable loss in order to satisfy the approximately $8.1 billion in withdrawals. As a result of the rush, the bank was obliged to liquidate assets. And, similar to others, Silvergate was shaken by the contagion caused by the failure of high-profile <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> firms in 2022, leading to a large decline in the industry, that reached its lowest in November.</p>
<p>Even with the unfavorable Q4 statistics, Silvergate&#8217;s (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SI/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMy_h8BaAw5prrgnaUampMmSHDYHPJURPPXfLOHwQFkrocPwoaRZH2VTpuN3rAn-aIqtqAeksc83PggnsIEog9Sms3B2y--u0-U7qOzZ83IludQaBcQjc9n8Zi6AMGIAstldyjYCm79KHnOUUsUt_pgUc68arPCQrROOnvC0gzTD" rel="nofollow">SI</a>) stock is currently trading at a pre-market valuation of $14, which is a whopping 5.8% increase in comparison to its 40% one-day decline, witnessed during the first week of January.</p>

<p>My Neighbor Alice is developed by Antler Interactive and is inspired by popular online games such as Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. <strong>My Neighbor Alice, <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-metaverse-games/">a metaverse game </a></strong>has won many hearts with its unique features and in-app purchase modes. Its advanced <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a></strong> and in-game <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Defi</a> features set it apart from other online games on the market.</p>
<p>My Neighbor Alice is a multiplayer game that introduces those who want to <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collect and trade NFTs</a></strong>, even if they are complete beginners, to the vast world of blockchain. To give its users the best of both worlds, the game offers a fun narrative for those who just want to play and a virtual ecosystem for players. Despite the fact that it was only released a few months ago, My Neighbor Alice has quickly become one of the most popular blockchain games.</p>
<h3><b> Key takeaways</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>My Neighbor Alice is a multiplayer game that introduces those who want to collect and trade NFTs.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>My Neighbor Alice targets two distinct audiences: gamers and Defi enthusiasts.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>The user can alter the shape, construct a house, or plant vegetation on a plot of land they have purchased from Alice</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>How does My Neighbor Alice work?</b></h3>
<p>In January 2021, a game test was conducted on the Steam website. The user can access a special island once they&#8217;ve signed into the platform. Work on it will be done by both humans and animals. Players are essentially unrestricted in their field of employment.</p>
<p>In addition to growing plants, you can also breed bees and fish. Expanding one&#8217;s territory is the primary objective of players. Similar to the well-known browser game Happy Farmer, this one&#8217;s gameplay mechanics will be simple. By exchanging rewards with other players, you can obtain the items you require. In-game currency can be converted into Alice tokens, which you can then sell, and <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/why-are-cryptopunks-so-popular-can-you-create-nft-collections-like-cryptopunks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collectible NFTs</a></strong> can also be sold to earn money.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to remember that although a certain function will require donations, the game itself does not. The target audience for the project is adults over the age of 18. However, the game is appropriate for all players over the age of 12.</p>
<h3>What Can Users Do in this Game?</h3>
<p>Users can do various things in the game. Some are:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Make items for the game</li>
<li aria-level="1">Build homes and other structures</li>
<li aria-level="1">Character development</li>
<li aria-level="1">Fulfill daily missions</li>
<li aria-level="1">Exchange their land parcels</li>
<li aria-level="1">Interrogate other players</li>
</ol>
<p>My Neighbor Alice is a classic farm game. Here, regular players will actually enjoy themselves if they enjoy an intriguing story and want to collect and trade NFTs. Additionally, playing this game will enable those who want to earn money to do so in a successful manner.</p>

<h2><b>What makes My Neighbor Alice unique?</b></h2>
<p>My Neighbor Alice targets two distinct audiences: gamers and Defi enthusiasts, making it a one-of-a-kind initiative in terms of game use cases. A multiplayer builder game, blockchain-based in-game assets, staking, and a loan economy for NFTs are among the technologies used to build its ecosystem. This is what distinguishes My Neighbor Alice from other games such as<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Decentraland</a></strong> or popular <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaverse</a></strong> platforms such as <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sandbox</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The novel feature of My Neighbor Alice also involves the deposit of a portion of each <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/most-expensive-nfts-ever-sold-heres-the-top-10-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT&#8217;s purchase price</a></strong> into a particular account connected to the NFT. Due to their inherent value, which guarantees that they always maintain a predetermined minimum value, NFTs can also be used as collateral in Defi lending applications.</p>
<h2>How to play My Neighbor Alice?</h2>
<p>Once the plot of land has been acquired from Alice or from the market, players are free to modify it however they see fit. They can alter the terrain&#8217;s appearance and add a variety of in-game decorations, including houses, lakes, animals, plants, and other things that can be bought separately. Both the in-game market and the NFT markets on other blockchains could be used to trade game items.</p>
<p>A reputation system in the game rewards players who are good landowners with growing benefits (up to participating in the Community Council). It will open up a variety of opportunities for players to collaborate and pool.</p>
<p>For instance, the game will allow players to take part in activities and competitions that are organized by the community. A decentralized forum will also be made available by My Neighbor Alice, allowing users to discuss game activities, determine the voting schedule for the Decentralized Organization, and look for new friends.</p>
<h2>Features of My Neighbor Alice</h2>
<p>The following are My Neighbor Alice&#8217;s four main characteristics.</p>
<h3>1. Avatar</h3>
<p>Like in other virtual games, players need an avatar to interact with other players and navigate the world of MNA. Players could further express themselves through their avatars thanks to the more than a thousand different outfits and accessories available.</p>
<h3>2. Digital Island</h3>
<p>Through six different types of Virtual Islands, players can expand their NFT empire.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lummested (Town)</li>
<li>Snowflake Island</li>
<li>Medieval Plains</li>
<li>Submerged Islands</li>
<li> Nature’s Rest</li>
<li>Sandy Coast</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. In-Game Asset</h3>
<p>Players in MNA can craft a variety of items to use in commercial endeavors and for land decoration. Additionally, there are more than a dozen catalogs in the market where players can shop for houses, pets, groceries, and fashion items for their avatars.</p>
<h3> 4. ALICE Token</h3>
<p>My Neighbor Alice made use of the ALICE coin, an in-game currency that token owners could use to make purchases and conduct other transactions in the Alice universe. Coins can be used to purchase play-to-earn rewards, in-game items and bets, and more.</p>
<h3><b>What is ALICE Token?</b></h3>
<p>The native token for the cooperative farm-building video game My Neighbor Alice is called ALICE. ALICE was developed using the ERC20 Token specification and is built on the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-is-vitalik-buterin-discover-eth-founders-home-net-worth-and-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a></strong> network. In the game, players can construct islands, invest ALICE tokens in virtual islands, hunt for new collectibles, and more. The game&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/5-reasons-why-nfts-sales-were-successful-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT Marketplace</a></strong> accepts the ALICE token. It allows users to exchange NFTs and make money off of their inventions.</p>
<h2><b>Uses of ALICE Token</b></h2>
<p>The following are some of the uses for the My Neighbor Alice token:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Buying game items</b>: You can use the in-game currency ALICE to purchase NFTs for avatars as well as in-game goods.</li>
<li><b>Play for rewards</b>: Participating in various in-game activities, such as tournaments, will earn you ALICE tokens.</li>
<li><b>Benefits of stake</b>: In the system, staking incentives can be obtained by using the ALICE token. It is meant to persuade users to hold tokens and support the ecosystem.</li>
<li><b>Dispersed administration</b>: Through the Community Council, which decides how funds are spent as well as game development and expansion, token holders may be able to take part in the decentralized governance process.</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>How to Purchase and Sell Land in My Neighbor Alice?</b></h2>
<p>A finite number of digital land plots make up the My Neighbor Alice universe. On the MNA platform, a portion of them is accessible to everyone. NFT tokens are used to represent every land parcel. The user can alter the shape, construct a house, or plant vegetation on a plot of land they have purchased from Alice or from the market.</p>
<p>Playing the game requires a purchased plot of land. Additionally, you can eventually rent it out or sell it to make money. You can also sell it in-game or on an outside NFT exchange. You must be the winner of the virtual lottery for the sale of land in order to buy a plot of land. Here&#8217;s what you need to do.</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Visit the website.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Connect a wallet on MetaMast.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Select the Binance SmartChain MetaMask network.</li>
<li aria-level="1">To register your address, put down 20 Alice tokens.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Verify the payment.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Wait 14 days until the bidding phase is over.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The user will be required to pay 20 tokens for the land plot if they are one of the lottery winners.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can either take tokens out of your account or keep them there until the next lottery if you&#8217;re unlucky enough not to have won the land plot.</p>

<h2><b>How to earn money from My Neighbor Alice?</b></h2>
<p>The interaction between players as they manage My Neighbor Alice&#8217;s economy leads to numerous earning opportunities, as will be explained below.</p>

Software wallets provide an alternative that is cost-free and easy to use. They can be downloaded as desktop or smartphone apps and can be either custodial or non-custodial.</p>

<h3><b>The DeFi Element</b></h3>
<p>The game My Neighbor Alice is much more than that. It functions as both a decentralized application and a yield farm. You can stake your ALICE tokens and add liquidity pools. The gaming platform&#8217;s revenue from asset sales and transaction fees is used to pay the stake rewards.</p>
<p>Defi features such as collateralization and buybacks are planned and will be implemented in accordance with the game development roadmap. Many incentives, such as high staking rewards, are aimed at the early birds in the game. However, as new gaming features are released, these will gradually decrease.</p>
<p>Another intriguing Defi feature of this game is collateral-filled NFTs. Players not only earn monthly interest on their NFT holdings, but they also receive instant liquidity when it comes time to liquidate these holdings.</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>The integration of smart contracts, NFTs, and enjoyable components in the form of games is one of the most alluring uses of blockchain technology. It&#8217;s a sizable, underserved market that is currently just starting out. If the current pattern of increasing NFT popularity persists, My Neighbor Alice may rank among the most well-known blockchain-based projects worldwide.</p>

However, the claims around the Common enterprises have become a real problem for the SEC in this case.</p>
<h2>XRP lawyer claims SEC is stretching too far</h2>
<p>John Deaton, XRP holders’ lawyer in <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Ripple Lawsuit</a> called out the experts which are predicting that SEC will secure a win here and claims that XRP is doomed now. He asserted that they are overstating the commission’s chances as their allegations are stretched too far.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1615104015532007430" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">XRP lawyer pointed out</a> SEC’s argument around Ripple stating it is a common enterprise. However, Ripple has already forced the commission to admit that holding XRP doesn’t gives a holder rights in RIpple. While Ripple owes nothing to XRP holders. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>While before anyone could file the amicus request, XRP holders with 3K affidavits stating the majority of first time buyers submitted their request in the XRP lawsuit. As thousands of the holders bought XRP for non-investment reasons, they received financial benefits independently of Ripple.</p>
<p>However, this amicus also challenged the expert witness which are allegedly hired by the SEC in order to issue a report against XRP. Meanwhile, at the time of deposition, the SEC expert presented a Twitter during cross examination by the defendants&#8217; lawyer.</p>
<h2>Is SEC still contradicting its argument?</h2>
<p>This brings to the main question of what is the common enterprise. XRP lawyer states that it can’t be Ripple and since the SEC abandoned their expert there is no “XRP Ecosystem” testimony before Judge Torres in the XRP lawsuit. While SEC’s briefs claim that XRP is the common enterprise itself.</p>
<p>However, the commission also claims that the XRP itself presented all the promises and inducements and efforts made by Ripple. This directly suggests that the SEC is arguing that Ripple’s native token single handedly satisfies both the second and third prongs of Howey.</p>
