<ul>
<li>New court filing reveals troubled FTX splurged $40 million on luxury meals and flights before its collapse.</li>



<li>A large chunk of the sum was spent on hotels, with one raking in $5.8 million within a nine-month period.</li>



<li>FTX’s bankruptcy filing has opened up a can of worms from which industry members are still reeling.</li>
</ul>



<p>A deep dive into FTX’s expenses nine months preceding the exchange’s collapse reveals a wild pattern of frivolous expenses that disappointed creditors.</p>



<p>As the bankruptcy proceedings against FTX drags on, a new filing has unmasked the nature of spending embarked upon by the exchange. The filings show that the embattled exchange blew over $40 million between January and September 2020 before succumbing to liquidity issues.</p>



<p>The filing disclosed that the company spent 5.8 million dollars at the luxury Albany Hotel in the Bahamas while 3.6 million and $800,000 were spent at the Grand Hyatt and Rosewood resort respectively. In total, FTX high-level employees spent nearly $15 million on accommodation in five-star hotels around the world.</p>



<p>Meals were a major expenditure for FTX in the nine-month period under review, with the filing showing that over $3 million were paid to catering services. Other forms of entertainment caused FTX a small fortune, while a staggering $4 million was spent on flights.</p>



<p>Another source of spending for the company was donations to local charities in the Bahamas. It is unclear how much the company donated to local aid groups in the small island nation, but pundits believe the bulk of donations will be returned as the Bahamian government tries to absolve itself of any <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-accepts-extradition-to-the-us-after-deadlock/">wrongdoing</a>.</p>



<p>The Financial Times reports that the Sam Bankman-Fried company struck a deal with an airline to deliver employees’ Amazon purchases to the Bahamas in record time.</p>



<p>Former employees have described FTX’s profligate spending as “<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sbf-bags-250-million-bail-could-face-up-to-100-years-in-jail-as-close-associates-plead-guilty/">cult-like</a>” and “moronically inefficient”.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-large-can-of-worms"><strong>A large can of worms</strong></h2>



<p>Caroline Ellison, a former top-level executive at Alameda Research, told the court that she collaborated with Bankman-Fried to “conceal” the extent of the firm&#8217;s loans and borrowing to investors. Ellison confirmed in her plea hearing Bankman-Fried and other top executives received loans running into billions of dollars.</p>



<p>FTX co-founder Gary Wang pled guilty to charges, saying that he was part of a plot to give Alameda Research “special privileges” by tweaking FTX’s code without disclosing the move to investors of the exchange.</p>

<p>Cardano (ADA), the 8th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a colossal price spike in the first week of January 2023. The move is auspicious for ADA, especially as many altcoins are still nursing losses carried over from 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-ada-whale-addresses-are-to-be-credited-mostly-for-the-price-swing"><strong>ADA whale addresses are to be credited mostly for the price swing</strong></h2>



<p>The price upswing is linked to a notable force in the market: <a href="https://zycrypto.com/even-as-whales-offload-ada-cardano-could-see-huge-price-boost-if-this-happens/">ADA whales</a>. Popular cryptocurrency market intelligence platform Santiment reported that barbel backtracks from sellers had been spotted.</p>



<p>It appears that ADA holders had dumped over half a million worth of ADA tokens within November and December of 2022, only to return to holding a notable size of the dumped coins.</p>



<p><em>“Cardano is enjoying a mini-surge at this hour, and addresses holding between 1M to 100M $ADA may be a main validator to watch for a price breakout. After dumping 568.4M coins the final 2 months of 2022, they have added back 217.2M $ADA to start 2023.” Santiment noted in a recent tweet.</em></p>



<p>While there’s no known factor fueling this backpedalling, investor behaviour, as highlighted by a previous report from Santiment, gives insight into what might be happening.</p>



<p>Apparently, investors holding between 10,000 and 1,000,000 ADA&nbsp; were imitating behaviours exhibited by investors during the 2019 bear market by accumulating assets.</p>



<p>This pattern took a pause within the last periods of 2021 when ADA’s price tapped $1.3 and turned into “net sellers” of ADA, up until ADA’s price was at $0.33 and dipped even lower within the last two months of 2022.</p>



<p>Santiment explains why investors might have taken the route they took and hints at the possibility of their return to the market by accumulation, a pattern which now seems to be unfolding.</p>



<p><em>“This suggests that these investors may be cautious about the potential of ADA and have been selling off their holdings. It will be interesting to see if these investors decide to start accumulating aggressively again in the future.” Santiment explained.</em></p>



<p>It is worth noting that many market players have collectively predicted that the cryptocurrency market is likely to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/global-recession-will-push-bitcoin-price-to-remarkable-highs-in-2023-bloomberg-analysts/">record an upsurge</a> in adoption. This is due to the expected economic recession that the United States is expected to experience this year.</p>



<p>As such, market players might be increasing their holdings in assets like ADA to hedge against inflation. However, whether that is the sieving factor behind ADA’s current accumulation by whales is not certain.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, at the time of this report, ADA is trading at $0.32. ADA’s performance in 2023 at this time is quite impressive. The asset is up over 29% within the last seven days and has recorded a favourable price increase every day since the 29th of December last year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crypto payments platform Wyre sets a new withdrawal policy allowing users to withdraw only 90% of their assets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The policy will include limits to specific assets, including a daily cap of 5 BTC, 50 ETH, and 20,000 USDC withdrawals. </li>



<li>Amidst growing concerns of bankruptcy, Wyre management expresses commitment to weather the storm.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The crypto winter has stretched longer than predicted by many experts and has made several web3 firms think outside the box to stay afloat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital asset payment platform Wyre has announced a new withdrawal policy in the wake of bankruptcy concerns hovering around the company. The new policy will allow users to withdraw up to 90% of their funds subject to their present daily limits. </p>



<p>The Francisco-based firm has <a href="https://twitter.com/sendwyre/status/1611774171050299392?s=21&amp;t=rGuB5tnGZGjAQr2ypXQlKQ">stated</a> that it is exploring strategic options to navigate the present bear market and it is in the <em>“best interest of the community.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“We are modifying our withdrawal policy. While customers will continue to be able to withdraw their funds, at this time, we are limiting withdrawals to no more than 90% of the funds currently in each customer account, subject to current daily limits,” </em>the company shared via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new policy also restricts daily withdrawals of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and fiat.  According to their website, there will be a limit of up to 5 BTC, 50 ETH, and 20,000 in DAI and USDC, while daily fiat withdrawals will be $150,000 and £140,000. </p>



<p>The company restated its commitment to simplify and expand global digital asset payments, adding that it will continue to “<em>explore strategic options” </em>to survive current market conditions. The announcement of withdrawal limits sparked panic within crypto spaces however some believe that the firm will weather the storm. </p>



<h2 id="h-wyre-s-issues-run-deep">Wyre’s issues run deep&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new company withdrawal policy comes amidst bankruptcy rumours and other operational issues. Last week, MetaMask made a shocking <a href="https://twitter.com/metamask/status/1611112520944701440?s=21&amp;t=SIG4AZVVwYwe3wFZdwbiEg">announcement</a> removing Wyre from its mobile aggregate which allows users to buy virtual assets via its extension. </p>



<p>The firm&#8217;s bankruptcy travails came to the fore last month by allegations by two former employees. The company denied the allegation stating that it will “<em>scale back” </em>to plan new strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyre has also carried out a management shakeup with Stephen Cheng elevated to the CEO whilst assuring that the company’s operations will continue and the community will be updated with new developments.</p>

<p>Coinbase announced Tuesday that it plans to lay off 950 staff members, about 20% of its workforce, to reduce costs &#8211; according to an internal memo. The exchange is blaming the current market conditions for its continued personnel reduction.</p>



<p>In June last year, Coinbase announced another layoff of a fifth of its employees. Besides, its CEO Brian Armstrong is attributing the move to the macroeconomic factors that played a role in last year’s market downturn.</p>



<p>‘‘<em>In 2022, the crypto market trended downwards along with the broader macroeconomy. We also saw the fallout from unscrupulous actors in the industry (referring to the collapse of the crypto derivatives exchange FTX). There could still be further contagion</em>,’’ Armstrong said in a coverage by CNBC.</p>



<h2 id="h-coinbase-joins-amazon-meta-and-salesforce-in-layoff-trends"><strong>Coinbase Joins Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce in Layoff Trends</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase is not the only company cutting headcount amid the bear run. Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce have equally downsized, saying they hired more staff during the heightened activity before the pandemic. Coinbase announced that the layoff could reduce up to a quarter of its overhead costs, with the overall cost averaging $170 million, including sendoff packages for the retrenched personnel.</p>



<p>The exchange, publicly listed on Nasdaq under ticker COIN, added that it expected to adjust EBITDA losses for the year to within the $500 million benchmark set in 2021.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s announcement comes as the industry continues to battle the contagion around the collapse of FTX and the bankruptcies filed by notable industry players, including BlockFi and crypto miner Core Scientific. According to Armstrong, the exchange is also planning to close down projects with a lower probability of success. The executive is less optimistic about the future but believes tightening regulations could sanitize the space.</p>



<p>‘‘<em>The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry</em>,’’ he said. ‘‘<em>We may not have seen the last of it – there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to ensure that they follow the rules. Long term, that is a good thing, But short term, there is still a lot of market fear,</em>’’ Brian commented.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are currently showing a slight recovery following a market plunge last year. Bitcoin is up 4% in the past week, while Ethereum has gained more than 10% in the same period.</p>

<p>Bitcoin bulls managed to shake off December’s dust, decisively pushing past $17,000 for the first time in over three weeks. The world’s most traded cryptocurrency was trading at $17,348, up over 2.41% in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>Ethereum led in gains surging by over 4.55% in the same period to trade at $1,330 Monday noon. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 15 groups by market capitalization also gained steam, led by Solana and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ada-leads-weekend-gains-as-cardano-eyes-super-bullish-milestones-for-2023-bitcoin-ether-little-changed/">Cardano</a>, up over 22% and 13%. Dogecoin, BNB and MATIC followed quietly, adding over 8%, 7% and 3.20% overnight. Overall, the global crypto market cap increased by 3.49% to tap&nbsp;$855.83B, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s surprising rebound comes after Friday’s positive nonfarm payment rolls data. While this data suggests an imbalance between labour supply and demand still exists, investors viewed cooling wages as a sign the Fed may slow its rate-hiking ambitions. Moreover, with the US inflation expected to remain stable in the coming week, economists have been pencilling in a 25 basis-point increase in the Fed’s benchmark rate, with some FED officials suggesting that a half-point hike is possible.</p>



<p>Fed’s monetary tightening is a big factor in Bitcoin’s price movement, contributing significantly to the cryptocurrency’s 64% decline last year. Observers have thus argued that the top crypto benefits immensely from the FED easing its monetary policy.</p>



<p>On January 4, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced that hedge funds significantly reduced their Bitcoin short positions “across the board” towards the end of 2022. Bitcoin futures open interest decreased by 1,086 from 14,124 on December 27 to 13,038 on January 4. This rate of decline suggests that investors should keep an eye on the conversion movement with long bets.</p>



<p>Confidence in the crypto sector has also been rekindling as authorities continue <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-feds-launch-ftx-task-force-to-trace-and-recover-stolen-investor-funds/">to crack down</a> on FTX officials and other rogue actors worldwide-suggesting regulations may soon follow. According to John Reed Stark, Former Chief of SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, the trend is likely to continue, bringing back crypto’s shine and allure.</p>



<p>Onchain, Bitcoin’s sentiment indicator, has turned neutral, with exchange signals tilting to extremely bullishness, according to data from the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock. 53% of BTC holders are also depicted as making money at the moment, with only 37% being in the loss.</p>



<p>While there is still room for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-could-get-as-low-as-9000-asserts-pundit-who-correctly-predicted-btcs-top/">Bitcoin to plummet</a>, traders expect the price to mount a mini rally towards the $18,200 resistance. According to Cryptoquant’s “Greatest_Trader”, “<em>the end of the current bear market won’t be expected unless the price surpasses the realized price, currently at $19.7K.”</em></p>

<p>For most crypto firms, 2023 continues right from 2022, following the collapse of former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire in November. In the past three months, layoffs in the sector have hit an all-time high as crypto prices drop to record lows.</p>



<p>However, of most concern has been the rate at which major crypto lending firms have been declaring bankruptcy, with most of them tracing back connections to FTX or Alameda research. Gemini, a US-based crypto exchange, is now on the brink of facing a similar situation.</p>



<h2 id="h-gemini-s-uncertain-future"><strong>Gemini’s Uncertain Future</strong></h2>



<p>In the past week, the exchange has come under the spotlight for its huge crypto holdings trapped in Genesis, which has had liquidity issues since the FTX collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gemini users have been unable to withdraw about $900M from the exchanges Earn program after the platform suspended the program due to Genesis halting withdrawals on November 16. Launched in February 2021, Gemini Earn is a service that promises interest payments of up to 7.4% APY compounded daily on cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Apart from facing a string of user lawsuits, the Winklevoss twins-helmed crypto exchange has been trying to get Genesis to release the $900M to no avail. On Jan 2, Cameroon Winklevoss penned an open letter to Barry Silbert (CEO of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis), <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gemini-accuses-dcg-of-being-behind-genesis-woes/">accusing him</a> of “engaging in bad faith stall tactic” aimed at delaying negotiations to resolve the Genesis-Gemini situation. However, Barry denied the allegations, shifting the blame to Gemini, who failed to respond to a proposal on December 29th.</p>



<h2><strong>All Quiet on The Western Front</strong></h2>



<p>Despite facing a huge setback regarding the Earn, Gemini seems to have continued procession exchange user withdrawals without trouble. However, crypto analytics platform Cryptoquant has pointed out some glaring disparities suggesting that all may not be well with the New York-based exchange.</p>



<p>In a Jan 6 report, Cryptoquant revealed that Gemini “is experiencing declining exchange activity” on virtually all fronts. According to the firm,  cryptocurrency reserves for BTC, ETH, and stablecoins have dropped significantly. BTC deposits from other exchanges and trading volume have slumped to record lows, a sign that users are trying to avoid the exchange. </p>



<p><em>“These trends were exacerbated around the time Genesis paused withdrawals,”</em> wrote Cryptoquant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Onchain data, however, depicts Gemini as an institution-oriented exchange which could be the main reason it has been able to hold up. Institutions are generally depicted as long-term investors and hence have the appetite for holding through market storms retail investors. Last June, the exchange cut about 10% of its workforce, citing unfavourable market conditions, which could also help it cut on spending in the current crypto winter.</p>



<p>While it is unclear how long turbulent market conditions are likely to persist, it will be interesting to see how Gemini will come out of its current situation even as other crypto firms continue to fold.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-traders-hold-their-breath-as-the-new-year-opens-heres-whats-going-on-in-bitcoins-ecosystem/">turbulent performance</a> in 2022 hasn’t deterred big players from predicting a promising run for the asset in 2023. Bloomberg is one such platform with a bullish outlook on Bitcoin and presents notable reasons why the asset is poised to see rapid growth in the new year.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloomberg-cites-the-global-recession-as-a-bullish-propeller-for-bitcoin"><strong>Bloomberg cites the global recession as a bullish propeller for Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>In its most recent cryptocurrency outlook, Bloomberg analysts go over the impact of the perceived global recession on Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the market.</p>



<p><em>“The rising potential for a severe global economic shutdown may be a top crypto performance factor in 2023. Our bias is that Bitcoin is most likely to come out ahead in most scenarios…” Bloomberg explains.</em></p>



<p>It is worth noting that many other notable voices share Bloomberg’s views in the cryptocurrency industry. As 2022 came to a close and predictions for the new year rolled in, many prominent traders and investors mirrored this bullish sentiment.</p>



<p>The founder of Altana Digital Currency Fund, Alistair Milne, is one such figure. Milne called $45,000 for Bitcoin, given that inflation favours the asset.</p>



<p>Pointing to the inverted yield curve, which shows long-term interest rates are less than short-term interest rates, being a possible indicator, the report says that economic growth will ebb and result in implications for all assets.</p>



<p>Bitcoin could return to $12,000 or go even lower to $10,000 as a result. This would mean that the asset, which trades at $17,353 at press time, could shed anywhere from $4,490 or $6,940 of its current price. Nonetheless, it is still bound to make an upward comeback, the report maintained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77025" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was also noted that another case scenario that might play out differently from last year is the Federal Reserve and central banks being forced to start “easing back on deflationary forces from declining asset prices.”</p>



<p>If this becomes the case, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-price-could-get-as-low-as-9000-asserts-pundit-who-correctly-predicted-btcs-top/">Bitcoin</a> could also follow another positive pathway.</p>



<p><em>“In this Fed pivot scenario, Bitcoin is poised to transition to a digital version of gold and perform like the metal and US treasury long bonds. A swift recovery in declining GDP and asset prices appear less likely.” </em>Bloomberg conclusively asserts.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and Ether traded without much fanfare Friday as the top crypto’s volatility continued its rapid decline. At press time, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market volume, was trading at $16,983 after a 0.23% uptick in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ether was exchanging hands at $1,272 after a 0.71% increase in the same period, according to CoinMarketCap data. Notably, the two cryptos continued to hold within a narrow range they have occupied since mid-December.</p>



<p>Other cryptos on the top-ten list of non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies continued to lose ground, with XRP, Dogecoin and MATIC plunging 2.90%, 3.78% and 2.77%, respectively, in the past day. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 0.74% to $830B, while the total crypto market volume dropped by 14.05%&nbsp;to $27.35B.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-leads-in-gains"><strong>Cardano Leads in Gains</strong></h2>



<p>Cardano managed to shake off the weakness, surging by 5.66% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.29 at press time. In the past seven days, ADA, the native token for the Cardano proof-of-stake blockchain, has grown by over 18%, making it the largest gainer among the top ten cryptos.</p>



<p>ADA’s growth has been attributed to a range of key factors, including the user trust that goes with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-to-test-cardanos-new-wallet-with-1000000-worth-of-ada-experiment/">consistent growth</a> of its ecosystem. Earlier this week, Cardano dApps completed 16 million transactions hitting a new milestone. On January 4, crypto payments giant processor CoinGate noted in a report that ADA entered the top ten most used cryptos list for the first time in 2022.</p>



<p>Large investors also seem to be helping buoy ADA prices as the token’s current prices offer attractive discounts. Crypto market intelligence platform Santiment Feed attributed ADA’s end-of-week mini-surge to aggressive buying by addresses holding between 1M to 100M ADA.</p>



<p>According to the firm, this group of investors have added back 217.2M ADA since Jan 1 2023, despite dumping 568.4M coins in the final two months of 2022. As per the firm, this cohort “may be a main validator to watch for a price breakout”, potentially sending the price back to $0.30.</p>

<h2><strong>FTX Contagion Continues To Shake Markets.</strong></h2>



<p>Although the crypto market seems to have priced in the events of the last two or so months, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-feds-launch-ftx-task-force-to-trace-and-recover-stolen-investor-funds/">FTX contagion</a> continues to unravel, suppressing crypto prices further. Crypto bank&nbsp;Silvergate Capital became the latest casualty announcing on Thursday it was cutting 40%&nbsp;of its staff after facing US$8.1 billion in withdrawals sparked by the FTX failure in November.</p>



<p>Genesis Global Trading, one of the leading lenders in the industry, also reportedly cut its headcount by 305 and is considering filing for bankruptcy, according to a report by Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. On Friday, Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis Global Trading, announced it is shutting down a wealth-management division called HQ due to, among other reasons, a “prolonged crypto winter.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Fidelity files three trademark applications, delving into the metaverse with huge plans. </li>



<li>The firm leverages key areas like virtual real estate investments, NFT trading, and marketplace services. </li>



<li>Fidelity’s belief in digital assets has not wavered even after the implosion of FTX, with the firm poised to create more impact in the sector. </li>
</ul>



<p>Investment giant Fidelity is set to make inroads in the metaverse as its latest efforts in the development of web3 to the delight of metaverse users.</p>



<p>The firm filed three trademark applications in the United States covering a host of web3 products and services including, virtual real estate investments, cryptocurrency trading, and NFT marketplaces, among others. The investment giant&#8217;s latest move has kept users gleeful as they await the offerings in the metaverse. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks">filings</a>, the company is also looking at investment services for mutual and retirement funds in the metaverse. Another area is the provision of educational services and multiple conferences in digital reality platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>conducting classes, workshops, seminars, and conferences in the field of investments and in the field of marketing financial services in the metaverse and other virtual worlds,” </em>read the filing.</p>



<p>A metaverse electronic payment will also be rolled out as the filing states, “<em>financial administration of credit card accounts in the metaverse and other virtual worlds.” </em></p>



<p>Digital asset trading services in the metaverse will incorporate NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and electronic wallet services alongside a financial management advisory service in virtual real estate and referral services.</p>



<p><em>“Electronic wallet services in the nature of electronic storage and processing of virtual currency for electronic payments and transactions via a global computer network; digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency digital token.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 id="h-fidelity-s-digital-asset-drive">Fidelity’s digital asset drive&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Fidelity Investment’s push in cryptocurrencies this year has been nothing short of excellent despite the heavy criticisms by some lawmakers on its recent crypto offerings and the market downturn. In April, the firm announced plans to offer companies and their employees access to Bitcoin (BTC) in their 401(k) retirement accounts. </p>



<p>The investment company also launched Fidelity Crypto, a service that allows retail investors to trade Ethereum (ETH)  and BTC at zero fees from their phones. In October, the company increased its digital asset division by hiring 100 employees instead of other top firms laying off staff.</p>

<p>Bitcoin continued to trend range bound on Saturday, riling investors who had to contend with lacklustre price volatility in the past 14 months. At press time, the top cryptocurrency was trading at $16,966 after a 1.11% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its biggest rival, Ethereum, also traded sluggishly at $1263- a level it has been toying at for the past two days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77010" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike the past year, where a clique of high net-worth investors like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bull-tim-draper-sticks-to-250000-price-prediction-for-btc-in-2023/">Tim Draper</a> and Ark Invest CEO Cathie woods made extremely optimistic calls for Bitcoin, it has increasingly become harder for investors to predict where crypto prices may be going as 2023 unravels. However, some sceptics are convinced that Bitcoin will plunge lower before the curve can flatten out in the coming days.</p>



<p>For instance, Gareth Soloway, the chief market strategist of InTheMoneyStocks, believes there is more room for Bitcoin to the downside. Speaking to Kitco News earlier yesterday, the pundit who correctly predicted Bitcoin’s 2021 top, noted that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundit-who-predicted-bitcoins-plunge-to-20k-lowers-bet-to-12000/">Bitcoin could plunge</a> to $9,000. </p>



<p><em>“I’m still looking at eventually $12,000 to $13,000 in a short-term target. I do believe it will go lower than that and pierce $10,000 and could go as low as $9,000 before all this is over.”</em> Soloway told Kitco’s, David Lin.</p>



<p>According to him, the Bitcoin chart was in the process of forming a “bear flag pattern” which, if validated, could see its price drop to the said level. He, however, stated that BTC was likely to see a minor rally in the near term.</p>



<p><em>“All we have to do is take out $17,000, and I actually think we are going to get a short-term rally to about $18,400. So actually, I’m very short-term bullish, but you can’t ignore the bigger pattern here, which is still bearish.”</em></p>



<p>Soloway’s predictions come even as the FTX debacle hammers the markets. In the past two months, firms linked to Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire have been folding, crushing investors’ risk appetite. To Soloway, however, whereas “there is still some flushing to do”, there was no doubt that all this was getting closer to ending.</p>



<p><em>“We are also getting close to potential regulation, which I think will be a huge asset for bitcoin and crypto as that will be an avenue for big money to start dabbling in crypto again,”</em> he went on. </p>



<p>Previously, Soloway has called for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-gareth-soloway-reveals-probable-trigger-for-bitcoins-ascent-to-500000/">Bitcoin at $500,000</a> in the long term as clear regulations for the crypto sector are passed, and adoption picks up. Since tapping an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, Bitcoin’s price has fallen over 75%, making it the fourth largest wipe-out of all time in the asset’s history.</p>

<p>MicroStrategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin reserves, has continued to splash cash towards BTC purchases ignoring cynics and the industry’s chaos created by the stunning collapse of FTX.</p>



<h2 id="h-microstrategy-buys-more-btc"><strong>MicroStrategy Buys More BTC</strong></h2>



<p>In a Dec 28 filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the business intelligence company disclosed it had purchased 2,395 bitcoins for approximately $43 million between Nov 1, 2022, and Dec 21, 2022.</p>



<p>More interestingly, it revealed that it sold 704 BTC on Dec 22 to help it take advantage of the various US tax benefits given bitcoin’s vanished value since it first started acquiring the cryptocurrency in 2020. Notably, it later bought back 810 bitcoins at $16,845 per coin on Dec 24.</p>



<p>The latest purchase now brings MicroStrategy’s holdings to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-fears-centralization-as-microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-hit-132500-btc/">approximately 132,500 BTC</a> acquired at a total cost of around $4.03 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $30,397 a coin.</p>



<h2><strong>Crypto Community Puzzled At BTC Purchases</strong></h2>



<p>Whereas calls to purchase BTC at current discounted prices have been rising among crypto users, not everyone is stoked by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy.</p>



<p>In the wee hours on Saturday, Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and former CEO, shared a Bitcoin performance chart from 2020, tweeting;</p>



<p><em>“The Bitcoin Strategy is winning for MicroStrategy.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tuOaasGcaPbzNpJ5f5j-QtThyQUNHB5b046QcKY2YFmfzFzNzTifDt6KiBMW6OMnwvZdcHcyIAYC-gjnm3-zZNW52sg-jCp5XMy5fF40ZQ_MPYlqIPLyTLQxytH2NmaQodAzl83dQxqh0fQnEE1XvWLak_j23CJfd1vOqNkavQUB70bCxEN0mP3tH3DHw5yG4HEA4ygMJg" alt="C:\Users\Newton\Downloads\Fl0vsS3WYAM85fc.png"/></figure>



<p>The tweet, which has since garnered close to a million views, has received mixed reactions, with most comments suggesting most crypto adherents have lost hope in his bitcoin acquisition strategy.</p>



<p><em>“Microstrategy Bitcoin holdings are down 45%, which is almost the worst performer here. This chart assumes he went all in on Bitcoin at the date provided. In reality, he&#8217;s just been averaging in as everything crashes which defeats the point of this graphic,”</em> Fellow trader Nebraskan Gooner commented on the chart. </p>



<p><em>“$MSTR is down 90% from the high, has over 1 billion unrealized loss on the bitcoin, and has over $700 million debt to get those BTC. If that&#8217;s winning to you then I don&#8217;t want to know what losing means to you,”</em> another wrote.</p>



<p>With Bitcoin trading at around $16,966 at press time, MicroStrategy’s stash would now be worth just over $2.24 Billion, translating to an unrealized loss of about $1.79 billion.</p>



<p>Moreover, apart from debts owed to creditors for the purchase of Bitcoin, shares of MicroStrategy have continued to tumble, dropping nearly 50% following the FTX debacle.</p>



<p>Despite the downturn, MicroStrategy, which turned to bitcoin in 2020 as a hedge against inflation, remains unwavering, with Michael Saylor stressing that they <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-reiterates-it-has-a-long-term-focus-on-bitcoin-despite-a-harrowing-year/">will never sell</a> their Bitcoin. Saylor, who has previously revealed he owns 17,732 bitcoins, believes that the world most traded cryptocurrency is “unstoppable” and that, ultimately “, Bitcoin is the separation of money and state”.</p>

<ul>
<li>The partnership is a win for the Ethereum-scaling network, having welcomed a major NFT project from Solana, y00ts.</li>



<li>Polygon’s native MATIC token added 3% in the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>Financial services giant Mastercard is collaborating with Polygon to bring together music artists, their fans, and industry mentors through a Web 3 accelerator program. Mastercard Artist Accelerator will launch in spring 2023 with a live-streamed artists showcase &#8211; per the announcement.</p>



<p>The program targets musicians, DJs, and producers with the tools to share their content on Web 3, including minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It includes exclusive access to special events and music releases. For the fans, the MasterCard Artist Accelerator features a limited NFT edition dubbed The MasterCard Music Pass, providing users with exclusive Web3 learning resources.</p>



<p>Commenting about the launch during the Consumer Electronics Show, MasterCard Chief Marketing and Communication Officer Raja Rajammanar termed the partnership as an opportunity to nurture budding artists. &#8220;<em>Music is a universal passion, inspiring, moving, and bringing us together; however, it can feel impossible for budding artists to break in. With the MasterCard Accelerator, we are expanding access and driving connections further with cutting-edge Web3 technology,</em>&#8221; he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-mastercard-artist-accelerator-program-targets-new-crop-of-artists"><strong>Mastercard Artist Accelerator Program Targets New Crop of Artists</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon Studios, the firm behind Polygon blockchain, is optimistic that the program will empower a new generation of artists using blockchain technology &#8211; also educate the public about the technology. &#8221;<em>Web3 has the potential to empower a new type of artists that can grow a fan base, make a living and introduce novel mediums for self-expression and connection on their terms,</em>&#8221; CEO Ryan Wyatt said.</p>



<p>The announcement has boosted the price of Polygon’s native MATIC token, up to an intraday high of $0.8104, according to data shared by CoinMarketCap. The price changed by +3% in the past day and +5.79% in the last week. MATIC ranks tenth among other cryptos, with a market capitalization of more than $7 billion.</p>



<p>Mastercard Artist Accelerator is a win for Polygon, one of the fastest blockchains, onboarding major brands like Starbucks, Nike, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-nfts-finally-coming-to-over-1-4-billion-instagram-users-matic-primed-for-huge-boost/">Instagram</a>. The blockchain is said to have paid $3m in grants to have Solana NFT projects, y00ts, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-is-losing-its-touch-with-nfts-as-major-projects-announce-departure/">moved</a> to its platform. Together with DeGods, another NFT platform on Solana, y00Ts generated some of the highest NFT sales on Solana, up to 70%.</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysts mirror the development of the market in 2023 in line with the current status and future landmark activities.</li>



<li>The SEC v Ripple case, stablecoin, DeFi regulations, and demystification of the FTX saga, among others, are pivotal in swinging the pendulum.</li>



<li>Network upgrades on Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains rolled out this year will also set the tone for web3 development.</li>
</ul>



<p>The new year has come with new speculations and insights over the market as experts mirror key factors that can shape the growth of web3 over the next 12 months.</p>



<p>The major area analysts have dwelt on is the market&#8217;s bearish trend. Is an end in sight? Last year was chaotic, with several top assets losing as much as 60% in value with no positive roads in sight. Market leader, Bitcoin, slumped over 55% last year and still hangs below $17,000.</p>



<p>On the bright side, inflation is on the decline, and many experts have predicted stocks and other assets to bounce back, so the bear season may soon be over.</p>



<p>The SEC v Ripple (XRP) case is now two years old, and the final decision would be a landmark case for both the SEC and Ripple. On the side of the SEC, a judgment declaring XRP as a security could reshape digital asset regulation in the country.</p>



<p>Some commentators believe that the case would have a wider reach with authorities going after centralized exchanges like Binance US, Coinbase, and Kraken. Lewis Cohen, an attorney specializing in web3 and digital assets, stated that the SEC wants to go all out of its wins against XRP.</p>



<p>“<em>If they got their way, most US token marketplaces could not allow users to buy and sell ‘crypto securities’ without registering as an exchange or getting an exemption,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>A win for Ripple will prevent a draconian push by regulators to describe digital assets as securities. Specifically, it will be a landmark <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-will-triumph-in-sec-battle-and-gary-gensler-will-resign-this-year-pundit-predicts/">moment</a> for the XRP Army, which believes its beloved asset is being held back by the SEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-upgrades-for-ethereum"><strong>More upgrades for Ethereum</strong></h2>



<p>After Ethereum’s Merge last year, which <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">transitioned</a> the network to a proof-of-stake model reducing its energy usage by 99%, Vitalik Buterin restated his commitment to continue leading the advancement of web3. The blockchain will implement a Shanghai upgrade in Q1 2023 to enable stakers to withdraw their Ethereum (ETH).</p>



<p>Since staking kicked off on the blockchain, users have staked about $20 billion worth of ETH, including newly generated ETH, and will be available for withdrawal in March. Ethereum is also poised to extend its leadership as the leader in NFTs and other projects as its closest rival, Solana, battles migrating projects and technical issues.</p>

<p>Indonesia is considering setting up a national crypto exchange to keep pace with the fast-changing financial landscape.</p>



<p>Citing a Wednesday report by Bloomberg, the exchange is expected to launch later this year before the country assigns the Financial Services Authority (FSA) control over such assets. Presently, crypto assets in Indonesia are policed by “Bappebti” -the country’s commodities futures trading regulatory agency responsible for regulating commodity contracts.</p>



<p>Confirming the plan on Wednesday, January 4, Bappebti acting head Didid Noordiatmoko noted that the move was part of the country’s broader <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesia-set-to-tax-crypto-transactions-and-investments-from-may/">financial sector plan</a>.</p>



<p><em>“The FSA will assume regulatory power over the assets over the next two years, by which time the exchange should be set up,”</em> said Noordiatmoko.</p>



<p>The statement comes even as lawmakers push for a regulation seeking to task the FSA with regulation strengthening supervision and oversight of crypto-assets which have been booming in the South East Asia nation. Lawmakers presented the draft law in September 2022 following the Terra-induced turbulence by cryptocurrencies and the need to tighten the regulation of crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>Despite adopting a strict anti-crypto stance in the past, partially due to local regulations and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesias-islam-council-bans-muslims-from-trading-bitcoin-deems-crypto-as-haram/">Islamic laws,</a> Indonesia has been loosening its noose, opting for progressive regulations as demand for crypto assets continues to soar. According to the country’s trade ministry, as of November 30th 2022, there were 16 million crypto investors compared to 11.2 million at the end of 2021. </p>



<p>Despite the ongoing crypto winter slashing trading volumes globally, statistics provided by the trade ministry showed that Indonesians traded 212 trillion rupiahs ($14.3 billion) worth of crypto in the first half of 2022. Presently 383 crypto assets and 10 local coins can be traded by Indonesians, with another 151 assets and 10 coins under evaluation by the Bappebti.</p>



<p>It is important to note that while trading in digital assets is legal in the country, the use of crypto payments as a form of payment is prohibited in Indonesia after the country imposed a blanket ban on the practice in 2017. That could change if the proposed law on moving crypto assets from the  Bappebti to the FSA is passed. </p>
