<p class="s4">Staking your cryptocurrency is an ideal way of earning a passive income while also supporting the network&rsquo;s operation. Though the idea is sound, it comes with certain disadvantages for the user who is staking - meaning, his share of cryptocurrencies would remain locked in a wallet for a period of time and would remain inaccessible, thus limiting the ability to use or trade them.</p>
<p class="s4">But innovation never sleeps and thus sprung the idea of liquid staking.</p>
<p class="s4">With it, two key players emerged, captivating the attention of investors and enthusiasts like LIDO and Cosmos. These innovative platforms offer a revolutionary concept known as liquid staking, which combines the benefits of staking with the flexibility of decentralized finance (DeFi). We will also discuss an upcoming player who&rsquo;s big into DeFi, a meme token called Big Eyes Coin.</p>
<p class="s8">What Is Liquid Staking?</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking provides a solution to this liquidity problem. With liquid staking, you can stake your cryptocurrency and still maintain its flexibility. Instead of locking up your funds, they are tokenized into "staking derivatives" that represent your staked assets.</p>
<p class="s4">Thus, liquid staking offers the best of both worlds: the ability to earn staking rewards and maintain liquidity, allowing you to use your assets in various ways within the crypto ecosystem. It provides more flexibility and accessibility compared to traditional staking, where your funds are locked up for a specific duration.</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking holds huge future potential, and investing in tokens that are at the forefront of this unique mechanism will reap huge rewards.</p>
<p class="s10">LIDO - Unleashing The Power Of Liquid Staking</p>
<p class="s4">Imagine you have some cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, or Kusama, and you want to earn rewards by staking them.</p>
<p class="s4">Here's where LIDO comes in. LIDO is one of the best platforms that help you stake your cryptocurrencies through liquid staking. With LIDO, you can stake your assets and receive something called st-tokens. These st-tokens represent your staked assets and are linked to them in a one-to-one ratio. So, if you stake 1 Ethereum, you'll receive 1 st-token.</p>
<p class="s4">The cool thing about LIDO's liquid staking is that it allows you to enjoy the benefits of staking, like earning rewards, while still having the flexibility to trade or use your st-tokens in the DeFi world. So, win-win for both the network and staker.</p>

<p class="s4">Stride, the leading liquid staking protocol within the Cosmos ecosystem, offers liquid staking for several Cosmos chains, including the Cosmos Hub. Stride allows users to stake their tokens and receive staking derivatives that can be freely traded or redeemed with Stride for the original tokens.</p>
<p class="s4">By adopting Stride's non-custodial liquid staking protocol, users maintain full control over their assets, providing greater flexibility compared to traditional staking methods. With over 80% market share in the Cosmos ecosystem, Stride contributes to the decentralization and security of the network while enhancing the liquidity and accessibility of staked assets.</p>
