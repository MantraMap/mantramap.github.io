<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum&#8217;s co-founder Vitalik Buterin presented a visionary perspective on the future of crypto wallets, with a primary focus on account abstraction. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234-1024x556.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="556" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234-1024x556.png" alt="image 1234" class="wp-image-203822" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234-1024x556.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234-300x163.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234-768x417.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234-1536x833.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234-750x407.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234-1140x619.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1234.png 1644w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Vitalik Buterin Envisions Future of Crypto Wallets: Account Abstraction Revolution 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to Buterin, the future will witness a widespread transition from the current externally owned account (EOA) wallets to smart contract-based wallets, aiming to simplify the management of digital assets.</p>



<p>Buterin&#8217;s idea revolves around the concept of account abstraction, which entails abstracting away the technical complexities associated with managing crypto wallets. He envisions a future where individuals can seamlessly interact with blockchain networks using smart contract-based wallets, making the process as simple as managing an email account.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ethereum.org/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ethereum</a> co-founder emphasized that by leveraging the capabilities of smart contracts, users will have the flexibility to define their own rules and access controls for their digital assets. This level of customization and automation will eliminate the need for users to manually perform various wallet operations, such as signing transactions or managing private keys.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Vitalik Buterin 1" class="wp-image-203823" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Vitalik Buterin Envisions Future of Crypto Wallets: Account Abstraction Revolution 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The proposed shift to smart contract-based wallets offers numerous advantages, including enhanced security and improved user experience. With smart contract wallets, users can set up advanced security features like multi-factor authentication and programmable spending limits, providing robust protection against unauthorized access and potential hacks.</p>



<p>Additionally, the abstraction of complex technical details allows users to interact with blockchain networks using familiar interfaces, making the management of crypto assets more accessible to a broader audience. This user-friendly approach aligns with Buterin&#8217;s vision of democratizing the crypto space and encouraging mass adoption.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="959" height="640" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1.webp" alt="Vitalik Buterin 1" class="wp-image-203827" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1.webp 959w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-768x513.webp 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vitalik-Buterin-1-750x501.webp 750w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" title="Vitalik Buterin Envisions Future of Crypto Wallets: Account Abstraction Revolution 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While the transition to smart contract-based wallets presents significant opportunities, challenges lie ahead. Buterin acknowledged the need for continuous research and development to address potential scalability and security concerns associated with widespread adoption. He emphasized the importance of community collaboration and urged developers to explore new solutions and improvements collectively.</p>



<p>Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s EthCC talk shed light on the transformative potential of account abstraction and smart contract-based wallets. If successfully implemented, this paradigm shift could revolutionize the way individuals interact with blockchain networks and manage their digital assets, making cryptocurrency wallets as user-friendly and intuitive as managing an email account.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Former FTX executive, Zhe &#8220;Constance&#8221; Wang, joins crypto venture capital firm Sino Global Capital.</em></li>



<li><em>Wang held executive roles at FTX, including Chief Operating Officer and Co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets.</em></li>



<li><em>Sino Global Capital had been an early investor in FTX, and Wang&#8217;s hiring comes after FTX&#8217;s collapse and bankruptcy.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zhe &#8220;Constance&#8221; Wang, a former executive at FTX, has joined the crypto venture capital firm Sino Global Capital, according to sources familiar with the matter.</strong></h5>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/ex-ftx-chief-operating-officer-constance-wang-joins-vc-firm-sino-global-capital#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, Wang held key roles at FTX, serving as the Chief Operating Officer and Co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, the exchange&#8217;s affiliate in the Bahamas. Her responsibilities included overseeing global business expansion, token listings, and public relations and marketing efforts. Wang&#8217;s move to Sino Global Capital comes after FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, leading to a subsequent investigation into its operations.</p>



<p>Sino Global Capital, founded in 2015 by Matthew Graham, has revealed that it was an early investor in FTX. The firm had also launched a $200 million fund with FTX as a significant investor. The collaboration between Sino Global Capital and FTX aimed to support the vision of FTX and assist in its growth as a prominent player in the crypto industry. The bankruptcy filing by FTX, however, had a significant impact on its operations and financial stability.</p>



<p>Following FTX&#8217;s collapse, Wang has spent most of her time in China, according to insiders. Her move to Sino Global Capital indicates her continued involvement and interest in the crypto space. Wang&#8217;s expertise and experience in executive roles at <a href="https://coincu.com/203002-blockfi-failure-due-to-neglect-risks-ftx-alameda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> make her a valuable addition to the venture capital firm, which focuses on investing in promising crypto-related projects.</p>

<p>While Wang&#8217;s new position at Sino Global Capital signals a fresh start for her in the crypto industry, <a href="https://coincu.com/201784-former-ftx-executive-election-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other former FTX executives</a> have also been making moves. Amy Wu, who previously led FTX Ventures, recently joined Menlo Ventures, a well-established venture firm based in Silicon Valley. Additionally, Brett Harrison, former President of FTX US, has embarked on a new venture, founding a startup that aims to provide a GPT-4-powered trading algorithm code generator.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest, awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to a range of charges. Prosecutors allege that <a href="https://coincu.com/198247-bankman-fried-pretrial-motions-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> misused customer deposits to finance risky investments and funnel money to American politicians. Several of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s former business partners have already pleaded guilty to various charges and are cooperating with investigators.</p>

<p>The bankruptcy of the company, once a prominent and widely-used platform for trading digital assets, sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community. The legal proceedings surrounding the collapse have underscored the challenges faced by crypto exchanges and highlighted the importance of regulatory compliance and financial stability in the industry.</p>

<p>The price of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency fell 0.6% over the past day to $29,855. Despite three key prospects that bulls are focusing on for long-term holding and accumulation, including the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bitcoin.org/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> halving event, potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and speculation about a rate cut next year, one analyst believes that downside pressure is being catalyzed by the possible sell-off of the U.S. government&#8217;s seized Bitcoin stash.</p>

<p>This possible sell-off of BTC was caused by an announcement on July 12 by the U.S. Department of Justice that stirred speculation by appearing to transfer $300 million in BTC to new addresses in two transactions. Independent digital asset analyst Konstantin Anissimov told The Block that &#8220;I think that this price reduction is mostly driven by futures prices showing bearish signals, mostly driven by news the U.S. government is allegedly preparing to sell close to $300 million worth of Bitcoin. I believe the market is expecting this to happen very soon.&#8221; He added that &#8220;the total daily volume traded in Bitcoin is less than $2 billion right now. My assumption is some of this is wash trading. So, a sell-off of $300 million worth of Bitcoin should and will result in a negative price movement.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, the analyst expects any dip to be short-lived and followed by a price correction. While Bitcoin traditionally presents an inverse correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index, it failed to appreciate in the wake of DXY&#8217;s recent decline of around 2.3%. &#8220;The BTC-DXY relationship will be hard to shake for long, though,&#8221; said Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto is Macro Now newsletter. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just that the U.S. dollar is the denominator in the most-quoted pair for the crypto asset, and when the denominator goes down in value, the ratio goes up, all else being equal, it&#8217;s also that a weaker dollar boosts global liquidity by giving U.S. dollar debt holders around the world more room to breathe.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to the official announcement from the platform, Linea, the Layer 2 network has announced that it has begun opening an NFT airdrop for early network participants.</p>



<p>On July 11, Linea <a href="https://coincu.com/201743-linea-mainnet-alpha-to-launch-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> mainnet alpha, a powerful Layer 2 (L2) network with unparalleled scalability with a growing ecosystem of over 100 decentralized applications, developer tools development and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Linea Voyager is a creative and artistic way to celebrate the launch of the mainnet. The NFT airdrop will begin on July 18, 2023.</p>

<p>This collection comes in five different editions. The first four editions, “Alpha”, “Beta”, “Gamma”, “Delta” will be airdropped to the top four tiers of participants, based on their ranking in the final Voyage leaderboard. The fifth edition “Omega” will be available for claim by all other participants.</p>



<p>Once the NFT drops have been completed, the Omega edition will be made available to all remaining participants.</p>



<p>Instead of following the path of competitors like Arbitrum and Optimism with a token airdrop, Linea has instead opted to distribute commemorative NFTs.</p>



<p>How to join the NFT claim:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>There are two claim paths for the Linea Voyage: an airdrop and a mint. For participants who finished with more than 2500 points in the final Voyage leaderboard (around 352,000 participants), Consensys will use its own NFT platform to airdrop the NFTs to the wallet addresses used for the Linea Voyage on Galxe.</em></li>



<li><em>All other participants (2500 points and below) will be prompted to follow a simple claim flow:</em>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Visit the claim page</strong></em>*<br>Once the airdrop to top tier participants is complete,a link to claim the NFT will be posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://linea.build/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Linea.Build</a>. This link will lead you to the claim page where you will be asked to connect the same wallet you used to participate in the Voyage.&nbsp;*</li>



<li><em><strong>Buy Ethereum and add it to your wallet</strong></em>*<br>In order to pay the gas fee to mint your NFT, you will need to have LineaETH in your MetaMask wallet. You can easily buy Ethereum directly from MetaMask by following&nbsp;<a href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5509477383963-How-does-the-new-format-for-buying-crypto-in-MetaMask-work-" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">these instructions</a>*.</li>



<li><em><strong>Bridge Ethereum to LineaETH</strong></em>*<br>You can easily bridge your ETH to LineaETH by following&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.linea.build/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea#bridging-eth-from-ethereum-to-linea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these instructions</a>.*</li>

<p>The listing on Crypto.com, in addition to other exchanges such as MEXC, Gate.io, SushiSwap, and RCP Swap, has caused the price of Moons to surge for a second consecutive day. According to Coingecko, the token has risen by 141% in a single day and is currently trading at $0.41.</p>



<p>The excitement surrounding Moons has been fueled by the news that the Kraken crypto exchange is considering a listing. Although Kraken has not confirmed their intention to list Moons on their platform, this possibility has caused many Reddit users to be bullish about the future of Moons. One Reddit user even commented, &#8220;It gets serious&#8221; in response to the news.</p>

<p>The listing on Crypto.com has sparked a frenzy on the already popular cryptocurrency subreddit (r/Cryptocurrency), which has over 6.5 million users. One post on the subreddit stated that &#8220;Crypto.com suddenly becomes the default for millions of Redditors&#8221;, highlighting the potential impact of this listing. Some users expressed their surprise at the success of MOON, with one writing &#8220;Did anyone else not expect to make it this far? Like I don&#8217;t know what to do, I didn&#8217;t plan for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moons are ERC-20 tokens launched on Arbitrum Nova by Reddit administrators in 2020 as part of their community points program. These tokens are distributed to users based on their activity in the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit and can be used for tipping between users. Moons are stored in a user&#8217;s Vault, an Ethereum-based digital wallet that was rolled out Reddit-wide last year.</p>



<p>Despite the news reports yesterday that Kraken staff were entertaining the possibility of listing Moons on their platform, the exchange has clarified that there is no such intention to do so, as of this writing.</p>

<p>The court&#8217;s decision comes after the state&#8217;s Financial Institutions Division ordered the company to cease all activities due to concerns over a shortfall in customer funds and allegations that the company used customer funds to meet withdrawal requests.</p>



<p>According to documents <a href="https://twitter.com/NevadaDBI/status/1681382351325253632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> with Nevada&#8217;s Department of Business and Industry Financial Institutions Division, Prime Trust&#8217;s financial condition has deteriorated to a critically deficient level, rendering the company in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business. As a result, the court has appointed John Guedry, the president of the Bank of Nevada, to take over the operations of Prime Trust.</p>



<p>This latest development follows the regulator&#8217;s actions in June when it filed to <a href="https://coincu.com/198262-prime-trust-faces-receivership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take over</a> Prime Trust and freeze all of its businesses, citing the company&#8217;s near insolvency. The court order was issued just hours after BitGo, another crypto custodian, terminated its acquisition of the company.</p>

<p>The court filing reveals that <a href="https://coincu.com/198735-swan-bitcoin-withdrawn-all-prime-trust-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Trust</a> owes its clients over $85 million in fiat currency while having only around $3 million in fiat currency on hand. Additionally, the company owes approximately $69.5 million in cryptocurrency to its customers, with $68.6 million in cryptocurrency available. The filing also accuses the company of using funds from its customer accounts to fulfill withdrawal requests from its &#8220;legacy wallets.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to the court order, the Financial Institutions Division stated that the court-appointed receiver would assume control of Prime Trust&#8217;s day-to-day operations and determine the best course of action to protect the interests of the company&#8217;s clients. The receiver will be responsible for assessing the overall situation and finding a resolution.</p>



<p>Prime Trust will have an opportunity to present its case and challenge the receivership petition during a hearing scheduled for August 22. The court order restricts the company&#8217;s employees and executives from interfering with the court&#8217;s decision.</p>



<p>The Nevada financial regulator&#8217;s swift action in placing Prime Trust into receivership highlights the importance of safeguarding users, the public and maintaining confidence in the emerging cryptocurrency market. The decision aims to address the concerns raised regarding the company&#8217;s financial stability and its ability to honor customer withdrawals.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that prior to these difficulties, Prime Trust was in talks for acquisition by <a href="https://coincu.com/197226-bitgo-wont-buy-back-prime-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitGo</a>. However, following the cease-and-desist order from the Financial Institutions Division, BitGo officially called off the acquisition, further adding to the challenges faced by the company.</p>

<p>The court&#8217;s decision to place Prime Trust into receivership marks a significant development in the company&#8217;s ongoing situation. The upcoming hearing in August will provide a platform for the company to present its arguments and potentially contest the receivership petition.</p>

<p>One of the major highlights was the discussion on the RANDAO + VDF random number conundrum. The Ethereum Foundation researchers shared insights into ongoing efforts to address the challenge of generating reliable and unpredictable random numbers on the Ethereum network. Various proposals, including the use of RANDAO (Random Number Distributed Autonomous Organization) and VDF (Verifiable Delay Function), were explored to enhance the security and reliability of random number generation.</p>



<p>Regarding SSV and DVT, the participants engaged in a lively debate on the necessity and potential benefits of implementing these technologies. SSV, aimed at reducing the computational load on Ethereum nodes, and DVT, focusing on secure storage solutions, were evaluated for their feasibility and impact on network scalability.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The CEO of the EminiFX Cryptocurrency and Forex Trading Platform was sentenced to 9 years in prison for the scam scheme.</em></li>



<li><em>Eddy Alexandre pleaded guilty to executing a fraudulent scheme through his platform to defraud more than 25,000 investors out of more than $249 million.</em></li>



<li><em>So the scam platform is operated in the form of multi-level marketing programs, encouraging old investors to attract new users to the platform.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/crypto-fund-fraudster-gets-nine-years-for-249-million-scheme#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bloomberg</a>, a federal court in Manhattan has sentenced Eddy Alexandre, founder, and CEO of EminiFX, to nine years in prison for executing a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme.</strong></h5>

<p>EminiFX is a cryptocurrency and forex trading platform. Accordingly, the platform is operated as a multi-level marketing program, encouraging old investors to attract new users to the platform.</p>



<p>The verdict comes more than four months after the crypto scammer pleaded guilty to merchandise fraud by the platform defrauding more than 25,000 investors out of approximately $249 million. U.S. District Judge John Cronan in Manhattan said it was a massive scam in the Haitian-American community.</p>



<p>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on February 10 that Alexandre <a href="https://coincu.com/166355-eminifx-ceo-pleads-guilty-commodity-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pleaded </a>guilty to one count of merchandise fraud and will forfeit approximately $249 million in proceeds from illegal actions.</p>



<p>Alexandre, who was arrested and charged in May 2022 for his role in EminiFX, initially pleaded not guilty but changed his plea on February 10.</p>

<p>Reportedly, Alexandre had previously promised investors that they would double their money within five months to attract more than 25,000 investors by offering an attractive return of 5% a week into his fraud plan.</p>



<p>However, Alexandre only invests a small portion of the user&#8217;s money, and the rest of the money is spent on himself (depositing millions of dollars in a personal bank account and splurging on a new BMW) or on expenses business-related fees (including office space and attorneys). Without a plea agreement, Alexandre faces up to 30 years in prison.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>All 61,216 ETH worth $116.3 million was moved by a <a href="https://coincu.com/201542-whale-deposit-35m-bnb-preparing-buy-arkm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whale wallet</a>.</em></li>



<li><em>After eight years of immobility, the wallet suddenly transferred all ETH to the Kraken exchange, causing the community to panic about a possible big sell-off.</em></li>



<li><em>According to speculation from the community, this is likely a wallet related to a member of the Ethereum Foundation or an early investor in the project.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On the morning of July 19, many crypto investors on Twitter were bewildered because the movement of an Ethereum whale wallet containing 61,216 ETH (worth $116.3 million) had resumed after eight years of sleep.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Concerns about the ETH mentioned above wallet increased when it immediately transferred all assets to the Kraken exchange, as noted by Etherescan.</p>



<p>Currently, the true purpose of this ETH whale has yet to be discovered. Many people quickly came to the conclusion that $120 million of ETH is about to hit the market.</p>



<p>In particular, this is a pre-mine wallet, meaning that this wallet received ETH before the ICO event of Ethereum in 2015. Therefore, there has been a lot of speculation about the owner of this wallet. It could belong to one of the founders of Ethereum, a private investor or a particular core member of the Ethereum Foundation.</p>



<p>There is also speculation that the owner of the wallet may have known in advance that news could be detrimental to Ethereum in the near future and decided to sell off the asset to hedge risks.</p>



<p>This argument is with foundation, when global authorities, especially the US, in 2023 continuously targeted many large cryptocurrency projects such as Binance and Coinbase. Besides, the disadvantage can be towards the second largest cryptocurrency in the Ethereum market since it switched to using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. The SEC chairman also made a statement that did not rule out the possibility that ETH is a security.</p>



<p>Others say the person behind the wallet may want to send ETH to Kraken to participate in staking. With the above amount of 61,000 ETH, staking can receive up to $ 3.5 million in staking interest per year, equivalent to $ 10,000/day.</p>
