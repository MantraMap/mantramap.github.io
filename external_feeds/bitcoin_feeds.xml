Watkins also argued that the few games which did gain traction &#8220;relied on the allure of making money&#8221; which is not a sustainable model. </strong></p>
<h2>Web3 Gaming Not a Passing Fad</h2>
<p>However, in his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News, the Digital Arms CEO insisted that the industry&#8217;s focus has shifted back to making games with experiences and benefits which cannot be matched by traditional gaming. This shift in turn means Web3 gaming &#8220;is really just getting started&#8221; and may not be a passing fad as claimed by some critics, Watkins added.</p>
<p>Concerning his platform&#8217;s reported collaboration with the firearms industry, the CEO disclosed that this was made possible by the fact that some of Digital Arms&#8217; founding members, including himself, are veterans of the gun industry. Watkins also shared his thoughts on Apple&#8217;s augmented reality headset and how this is likely to be a game changer for the Web3 gaming industry.</p>
<p>Below are Watkins&#8217; answers to the questions sent to him via Telegram.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): What benefits do gamers have when they buy in-game non-fungible tokens (NFTs) versus traditional in-game assets?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris Watkins (CW):</strong> The main advantage here is the true ownership and traceability of the assets. As Esports and the fanbase of popular leagues grow, the potential to buy and trade firearms used by your favorite Pro gamer is just one of the many exciting use cases.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: According to a recent <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/09/2624004/0/en/Worldwide-Blockchain-Gaming-Market-Size-Share-Cap-Predicted-to-Reach-USD-1-020-02-Billion-By-2032-at-68-9-CAGR-Growth-Polaris-Market-Research.html">report</a> by Polaris Market Research, the worldwide blockchain gaming market size is expected to reach over $1 trillion by 2032, up from an estimated $5.4 billion in 2022. What key emerging trends do you see that will shape the future of Web3 gaming?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CW:</strong> A prominent trend is the blending of real-world brands with the gaming scene, through either advertising rights or branded playable assets. Blockchain technology serves as the crucial link, unlocking new revenue streams for game developers via NFT licensing rights. As this trend progresses, I predict a surge in games integrating NFTs so seamlessly that players may not even realize they&#8217;re purchasing and trading these unique digital assets.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Over the last few years, the Web3 gaming industry has experimented with play-to-earn, play-and-earn and a bunch of other models to attract players. Even though some Web3 games have gained traction, we have not yet landed upon a sustainable model that appeals to both players and game developers. What makes you believe that Web3 gaming is more than just a fad?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CW:</strong> Games developed during the last bull run cycle often appeared rushed and lacked the essential element of fun. Those that did gain traction primarily relied on the allure of making money. This model is not sustainable in the long run as it depends on a continuous flow of players willing to spend. However, I’m seeing many emerging game developers creating high-quality, entertaining games with incorporated play-to-earn aspects. The focus is shifting back to making games that are fun to play and offer unique experiences and benefits that traditional gaming can&#8217;t match. In my opinion, Web3 gaming is really just getting started &#8211; exciting times ahead!</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Your company Digital Arms is reportedly the only NFT marketplace where gamers can buy, sell, and customize licensed digital firearms from the world’s leading brands. Can you explain why the firearms industry chose Digital Arms and why they can or can’t sell their IP on other NFT marketplaces?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CW:</strong> The founding members of Digital Arms and I have over 25 years of experience in the firearms industry. We&#8217;ve built trust with leading brands and they&#8217;ve chosen us to guide them into the blockchain and digital collectable arena. We uphold their brand with high respect and ensure it&#8217;s delivered in a manner that aligns with their company image. No other marketplace or platform has our unique understanding of the firearms industry. Hence, the need for a unique marketplace like Digital Arms. You wouldn&#8217;t go to eBay or Amazon to buy a firearm, right?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p><strong>BCN: Self-expression through customization has been a part of video games for as long as we can remember. It would seem like there is an attractive opportunity for the firearm and hunting industries in the Web3 gaming realm. What challenges, in your opinion, do such brands face in bringing digital firearms to Web3 games, especially considering the firearms industry is heavily regulated in most parts of the world?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CW:</strong> Maintaining a positive public image is very important to the firearms industry. The challenge is to ensure their products and branding are portrayed respectfully by game developers. As for firearm regulations, this is the exciting part. We are dealing with digital assets, not the actual firearm. Gamers in restricted regions now can own a piece of the brand. Digital Arms is producing limited edition, authentic IP-licensed NFT digital collectibles crafted from the original 3D CAD files used in the actual manufacturing of the firearm.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Do you think Web3 gaming could become an attractive revenue stream for firearms manufacturers — or physical goods brands, in general — in the near future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CW:</strong> Yes, 100%! It&#8217;s already happening and is not limited to just firearms but many other in-game items and equipment.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Apple has just launched an innovative augmented reality headset called Apple Vision Pro. What role could such devices, assuming they become popular among gamers, play in the evolution of the Web3 gaming industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CW:</strong> Apple is leading the way, that&#8217;s for sure! This development is going to change the way we interact and play games in the future. Augmented reality can create immersive gaming experiences, combining digital items, such as our firearm NFTs, opens up a new world of possibilities.</p>

Blackrock is seeking to launch a bitcoin product despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) efforts to crack down on unregistered crypto platforms and securities tokens. The asset management firm has also chosen Coinbase, the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange that was recently charged by the SEC for securities law violations, to serve as custodian for its bitcoin trust.</strong></p>
<h2>Blackrock Files to Launch a Bitcoin Trust</h2>
<p>The world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htm">filed</a> for the registration of Ishares Bitcoin Trust (the Trust) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday despite the regulator&#8217;s ongoing regulatory crackdown on the cryptocurrency sector. According to Blackrock&#8217;s filing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The Trust was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on June 8,” the asset manager explained, adding that Blackrock Fund Advisors is the trustee of the Trust and Coinbase Custody Trust Company is the custodian for the Trust’s bitcoin holdings. The sponsor of the Trust is Ishares Delaware Trust Sponsor, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of Blackrock Inc.</p>
<p>“The Trust issues shares only in baskets of 40,000 or integral multiples thereof,” the filing further details, adding: “Baskets may be redeemed by the Trust in exchange for the amount of bitcoin corresponding to their redemption value.” Moreover, Blackrock stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Individual shares will not be redeemed by the Trust but will be listed and traded on Nasdaq.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many people view Blackrock’s filing as bullish for the entire crypto sector. Some have argued that the largest asset manager’s filing for a bitcoin trust is actually a filing for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which the SEC has not yet approved. So far, the securities regulator has rejected all filings for spot bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>Some people were also surprised that Blackrock is seeking to offer a bitcoin product using Coinbase as custodian when the SEC is cracking down on the crypto industry and has filed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ceo-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-accusing-crypto-exchange-of-securities-law-violations/">charges</a> against Coinbase for securities law violations. Onchain Capital co-founder Ran Neuner <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptomanran/status/1669595919497478144">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did Blackrock really just apply for a spot bitcoin ETF using Coinbase, a U.S. company that the SEC claims is actually an unlicensed securities exchange operating illegally?</p></blockquote>
<p>Several individuals drew comparisons between Blackrock&#8217;s bitcoin trust and Grayscale’s bitcoin trust (GBTC). Grayscale has been actively seeking to convert its bitcoin trust into a bitcoin ETF but the SEC has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-files-lawsuit-against-sec-over-spot-bitcoin-etf-rejection/">rejected</a> its filing so far.</p>
<p>Digibuild CEO Robert Salvador <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertJSalvador/status/1669491511614906369">opined</a>: &#8220;This is no different than the Grayscale. This can be used to short bitcoin into the floor. This is a Trojan horse, not a real ETF. Don’t be lulled to sleep.&#8221; Cardano enthusiast Chris O <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOCcryptobro/status/1669492782904520704">described</a>: &#8220;Blackrock is a trust, but you can redeem it, so effectively working the same as an outright spot ETF. Probably packaged this way to justify their undoubted approval.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1669495679004147714">explained</a>: “To all those saying the Blackrock filing is a trust and not an ETF. Do you consider $GLD to be an ETF? Well, this is same thing. Lot of structures under &#8216;ETF&#8217; umbrella. Nothing like $GBTC. This is the real deal.&#8221; He <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1669493772672008195">stressed</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, it is a trust, but so is every other physical commodity ETFs like $GLD. Same structure. This is a real deal spot ETF filing vs GBTC.</p></blockquote>
<p>Venture Coinist&#8217;s Luke Martin <a href="https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/1669494085990727685">noted</a>: &#8220;$SPY &amp; $GLD are good comparisons here. Both are ETFs structured as trusts. Same thing here. Key difference is it&#8217;s redeemable. unlike $GBTC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), who has been pushing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to provide <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethers-security-status-remains-unclear-as-sec-chair-gensler-fails-to-answer-lawmakers-question/">regulatory clarity</a> for the crypto sector and has repeatedly criticized him for his enforcement-centric approach to regulating the crypto sector, <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1669489512840306688">emphasized</a>: “The SEC must not pick winners and losers based on inconsistent factors. I&#8217;ll be watching this closely.&#8221; Vaneck advisor Gabor Gurbacs <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1669499297790820353">tweeted</a>: “There are/were a number of earlier spot bitcoin ETF applications. Approve the active filings in order of first filing. That would be fair. But who are we kidding to expect fairness?”</p>

This withdrawal arrangement was approved on Tuesday by the U.S. bankruptcy court located in Delaware.</strong></p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Exchange Bittrex US Enables Customer Withdrawals</h2>
<p>On May 8, 2023, Bittrex US filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing liabilities ranging from $500 million to $1 billion and having over 100,000 creditors. Before the bankruptcy filing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sued Bittrex for running an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and for listing unregistered crypto securities.</p>
<p>Bittrex sent emails to its U.S. customers this week, following approval from the U.S. bankruptcy court to enable withdrawals. However, there is a caveat: users must update their know-your-customer (KYC) information and agree to the latest terms of service. Bittrex asserts that this step is “necessary to comply with state and federal regulations.”</p>

<p>Withdrawals opened on June 15, 2023, and the company has provided resources for identity verification, withdrawal instructions, and wire instructions. &#8220;Customers have until August 31, 2023, to withdraw any remaining funds,&#8221; Bittrex states. While cryptocurrency withdrawals are relatively simple, fiat withdrawals require the submission of an application to link a bank account. Additionally, there is a $25 wire fee for customers who choose to wire funds through Bittrex.</p>

DAI&#x2019;s market valuation on Friday, June 16, 2023, is approximately $4.394 billion, but the number of circulating DAI has decreased by 5.7% since last month.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoin Rankings Shuffle: DAI Ascends to Third-Largest Stablecoin Position</h2>
<p>In May 2022, terra usd (UST), now known as terra usd classic (USTC), decoupled from its $1 parity, causing its value to plummet by over 98%. As a result, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BUSD/">BUSD</a> emerged as the third-largest stablecoin asset. Additionally, the stablecoin token issued by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-law-enforcement-directs-paxos-to-freeze-more-than-11000-paxg-tokenized-gold-coins/">Paxos</a> held a position among the top ten largest crypto assets by market valuation for several months, until February 13, 2023, when the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paxos-receives-wells-notice-from-sec-nydfs-orders-issuer-to-stop-minting-busd/">instructed</a> the company to halt the minting of BUSD.</p>

<p>Since then, a substantial amount of BUSD has been redeemed, with data indicating that approximately 11.8 billion BUSD has been burned following the NYDFS order. However, up until this week, or around June 15, 2023, BUSD continued to hold its position as the third-largest stablecoin. Today, that is <a href="https://archive.ph/ANkYp">no longer the case</a>, as <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DAI/">DAI</a> has officially taken its place as the third-largest dollar-pegged token, boasting a market valuation of $4.394 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BUSD/">BUSD</a>&#x2018;s present market valuation is approximately $4.304 billion, which is approximately $89,993,165 lower than <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DAI/">DAI</a>&#x2018;s market valuation. Furthermore, DAI distinguishes itself from the two largest existing stablecoins, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC, as it requires collateral to be locked up in order to generate new DAI tokens.</p>
<p>The project is also characterized by over-collateralization, necessitating additional collateral for minting DAI, and redeeming DAI involves returning DAI tokens to receive the underlying collateral. In contrast, Tether and Circle act as central issuers for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC, backing the tokens with collateral held by the issuers.</p>

<p>DAI&#x2019;s minting and redeeming activity has leaned more towards the redemption side in recent times, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of stablecoins since February 2022. During that period, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DAI/">DAI</a>&#x2018;s market valuation was approximately $9.8 billion, but today it has decreased by 55.16%. In the past month, BUSD has experienced a 22.5% reduction, while DAI&#x2019;s circulating supply has dropped by 5.7%.</p>

The failed blockchain firm and its founder, Do Kwon, have asked the court to dismiss a case filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that they defrauded investors whom they sold unregistered securities. </strong></p>
<h2>Judge Reviews Status of the Digital Assets Sold by Terraform in SEC’s Fraud Case</h2>
<p>A judge in New York has considered whether the digital coins issued by Terraform Labs were securities during a hearing in the SEC’s case against the crypto company and its South Korean co-founder and CEO Kwon Do-Hyung, better known as Do Kwon.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the U.S. securities regulator charged the crypto entrepreneur and his company with defrauding investors and selling billions of dollars’ worth of digital assets that the commission deems unregistered securities.</p>
<p>The value of the cryptocurrencies in question, stablecoin terrausd and the token luna, collapsed in May, 2022, causing the crash of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform ecosystem</a> which had a domino effect in the crypto markets and space. An estimated 200,000 people had bought the coins.</p>

<p>In the complaint, the SEC maintains that the company and its founder misled investors about the stability of the U.S.-dollar pegged stablecoin, Reuters noted in a report. They also claimed the tokens would increase in value, the regulator alleges.</p>
<p>Terraform Labs and Do Kwon want U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan to dismiss the SEC’s case, arguing that the platform’s digital currencies do not fit the existing definition of securities in the U.S. and that the SEC lacks authority over the crypto industry.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Rakoff questioned whether Terraform&#8217;s offering of a so-called Anchor protocol, which promised up to 20% returns on terrausd deposits, shouldn’t be considered a security. He was quoted elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is something you created, that only people who had taken this first step could take advantage of. I don’t see why that’s not a securities contract at that point.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Judge to Rule on Terraform’s Request for Case Dismissal in the Coming Weeks</h2>
<p>Judge Rakoff said he will rule on the motion to dismiss the case in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, by July 14. During the hearing, SEC Attorney Devon Staren insisted the commission is “not doing anything new” but “simply applying the securities laws.”</p>
<p>The SEC took legal action against major crypto exchanges <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a> last week, arguing in the lawsuits that a number of tokens listed by the two trading platforms represent unregistered securities.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-moved-29-million-worth-of-coins-since-arrest-prosecutor-says/">Do Kwon</a>, who disappeared after the crash of Terraform’s cryptocurrencies last year, was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-says-interior-minister/">arrested</a> in Montenegro on March 23 of this year while attempting to leave for Dubai on a fake Costa Rican passport. He is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-to-stand-trial-in-montenegro-may-serve-time-before-extradition/">standing</a> trial in the small Balkan nation for traveling on false documents. Both South Korea and the United States seek his extradition.</p>

The news follows Coinbase&#8217;s current dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the firm&#8217;s staking-as-a-service product.</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase Rolls Out 4% Stablecoin Rewards for Global Customers, Except Hawaii Residents</h2>
<p>Coinbase is now allowing users to earn 4% rewards by holding USDC on the centralized cryptocurrency trading platform, according to a Thursday <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1669480042924228609?s=20">announcement</a>. “Grow your savings with a rewarding, secure digital dollar,” Coinbase announced. “Global Coinbase customers can now earn 4% rewards on USDC.” Coinbase explains that as little as $1 in USDC can be held on the exchange to earn rewards.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s most recent USDC rewards service comes in the wake of the exchange being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">sued</a> by the SEC. The complaint alleges that the firm “failed to register its staking-as-a-service program as required by securities laws.” Additionally, the Alabama securities regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/alabama-securities-regulator-issues-show-cause-order-to-coinbase-joined-by-9-other-states-over-unregistered-securities/">contends</a> that Coinbase violated state securities regulations by “offering its staking rewards program accounts to Alabama residents without a registration to offer or sell these securities.”</p>

<p>Regarding the recent USDC rewards service, Coinbase specifies that the annual percentage rate (APR) of 4% is subject to change. “The rewards rate is subject to change and can vary,” the exchange explained on Thursday. “Customers will be able to see the latest applicable rates directly within their accounts.”</p>
<p>The Coinbase rewards program is accessible in <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/usd-coin-rewards-faq">71 countries</a>, including the United States, but excludes residents of Hawaii. To participate, Coinbase customers must be verified at tier two, the exchange’s latest announcement concludes.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on Coinbase&#8217;s decision to offer 4% rewards on USDC amidst its ongoing dispute with the SEC? We&#8217;d love to hear your perspective in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Bakkt&#x2019;s general counsel stated that the platform will expand its coin offering once there is &#x201C;further clarity.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Bakkt Reacts to Regulatory Pressure, Delists Solana, Polygon, and Cardano</h2>
<p><a href="https://bakkt.com/">Bakkt</a>, the New York-based digital asset platform, <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/16/bakkt-delists-solana-polygon-cardano-regulatory-clarity/">revealed</a> Friday that it is delisting solana (SOL), polygon (MATIC), and cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>). The move comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensifies its scrutiny of cryptocurrency platforms and designates certain assets as unregistered securities.</p>
<p>The announcement of Bakkt&#x2019;s delisting of SOL, MATIC, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> was made by the company&#x2019;s general counsel and secretary, Marc D&#x2019;Annunzio, in an interview with Fortune. D&#x2019;Annunzio stated that the proactive removal would continue &#x201C;until there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Prior to Bakkt&#x2019;s decision, the digital trading platform Robinhood has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">chosen</a> to delist cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>), solana (SOL), and polygon (MATIC). Similarly, Tel Aviv-based Etoro has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etoro-to-delist-algo-mana-dash-and-matic-for-us-customers-amid-evolving-regulatory-landscape/">announced</a> the delisting of ALGO, MANA, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>, and MATIC for U.S. customers, citing the same reasons. Both Robinhood and Etoro said the firms are implementing proactive measures until regulatory clarity is established in the United States.</p>

<p>All the tokens that were previously listed on Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro and subsequently delisted have been classified as unregistered securities by the U.S. SEC. The SEC&#x2019;s enforcement lawsuits also identify <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-338.pdf">XRP</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2019/comp-pr2019-212.pdf">TON</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">OMG</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">POWR</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59">BTT</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2019/comp-pr2019-87.pdf">KIN</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59">TRX</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-32">MIR</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183">EMAX</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">ALGO</a>, and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">IHT</a>, among others, as securities.</p>

Bitcoin has moved below $25,000 for the first time since March, as the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Binance and Coinbase. The Federal Reserve has also paused its rate hike policy, with traders still unsure of what this could mean for markets.</strong></p>
<h2>Current Market Status</h2>
<p>The action taken by the SEC earlier this month has been the main source of bearishness, with the regulator moving to crack down on operators in the space.</p>
<p>Following this, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-inflation-cools-to-4-annual-rate-setting-stage-for-feds-decision-on-interest-rates/">inflation</a> in the United States fell to lower than expected, coming in at a low of 4%, briefly boosting the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>However, with the Fed opting to keep rates <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">unchanged</a> for now, market uncertainty has heightened, with traders processing the potential long-term impacts of tighter monetary policy.</p>
<h2>June Outlook</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rose back above $25,000 on Friday, as traders moved to buy the recent dip in price.</p>
<p>The world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency plunged to its weakest point since March 16 earlier this week, triggered by the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision.</p>
<p>Bulls that have returned to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in recent days would have done so due to prices being oversold, with the relative strength index (RSI) hovering below the 30.00 mark.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the index has now broken out of a ceiling at 43.00, and is tracking at 43.26, which has prompted a rise in momentum.</p>
<p>The next visible point of resistance is at the 50.00 mark, and 57.00 thereafter. Should bulls move beyond both of these, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will likely be trading above $27,500 in the next few weeks.</p>

Overall, the global cryptocurrency market cap was marginally higher, climbing by 1% as of writing. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> was an exception, dropping to a three-week low today.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) moved away from its lowest point in almost two years, as crypto bulls swept in to buy the recent dip in price.</p>
<p>Following a bottom of $0.00000653 on Thursday, SHIB/USD rose to a high of $0.00000682 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This rally resulted in the meme coin moving away from last Saturday&#x2019;s bottom at $0.00000600, which is the weakest point price has hit since September 2021.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the sell-off has eased, which came as SHIB began consolidating around a key support point of $0.00000635.</p>
<p>Overall, sentiment in the meme coin remains significantly bearish, with price strength tracking below the 30.00 level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is tracking at 25.62, after bouncing from a recent floor at 21.00.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>On the other hand, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, extended a recent downtrend, with the token falling to a fresh multi-week low.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD plunged to an intraday low of $0.4601 on Friday, a day after trading at a peak of $0.4833.</p>
<p>As a result of this decline, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> fell by nearly 4% in today&#x2019;s session, dropping to its lowest point since May 26 in the process.</p>

<p>In the last seven days the token has lost nearly 14% of its value, which comes after the price rose to a ten-week high on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Initially, it appears that bulls were likely capturing profits and liquidating their positions, however sentiment shifted, with bears using this as an opportunity to reenter the market.</p>
<p>Should this current trend continue, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> will hit a floor of $0.4200 in the near future.</p>

The attorney general stated that Coinex will pay $1.7 million in penalties and refunds and is barred from operating its platform in the state.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Exchange Coinex Settles Legal Battle With NY Attorney General</h2>
<p>In late February 2023, Letitia James, the attorney general (AG) of New York, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-attorney-general-sues-crypto-exchange-coinex-claims-trading-platform-offers-unregistered-securities/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Coinex, a cryptocurrency exchange. The allegations included the offering of unregistered securities and operating an unregistered exchange. As per the initial complaint, the AG&#x2019;s Office discovered that unregistered securities were obtainable from Coinex in New York.</p>
<p>A little over three months later, Coinex has <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-recovers-17-million-cryptocurrency-platform-operating">reached a settlement</a> with the AG, agreeing to pay $1.7 million in penalties and refunds. Consequently, the exchange is now prohibited from operating in New York, and Coinex has expressed its plans to withdraw from the entire United States. James emphasized that the primary objective of the AG&#x2019;s Office is to safeguard investors in New York, and she hopes that this settlement serves as a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Unregistered crypto platforms pose a risk to investors, consumers, and the broader economy,&#x201D; James said. &#x201C;Today&#x2019;s agreement should serve as a warning to crypto companies that there are hefty consequences for ignoring New York&#x2019;s laws. My office will continue to crack down on crypto companies that brazenly disregard the law, mislead investors, and put New Yorkers at risk.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In a parallel fashion in March, the AG&#x2019;s Office filed a lawsuit against Kucoin, adopting a similar approach. Notably, the state&#x2019;s chief law enforcement officer <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-attorney-general-files-lawsuit-against-kucoin-and-declares-ethereum-a-security/">classified</a> ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) as an unregistered security in that particular case. Furthermore, in May, the AG Office successfully <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-secures-43-million-cryptocurrency-company-defrauding">obtained</a> $4.3 million from Coin Cafe, a crypto firm based in Brooklyn, for its deceptive practices towards investors.</p>
<p>The crackdown led by James and her office has coincided with the heightened enforcement efforts initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the same period.</p>
