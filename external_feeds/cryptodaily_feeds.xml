			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee are demanding that SEC Chair Gary Gensler explain how Prometheum got approval from the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawmakers have petitioned both financial regulators for more information regarding the company&rsquo;s registration status.&nbsp;</p>
Republicans Demand Answers&nbsp;
<p>The Republican lawmakers on the Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Patrick McHenry, have questioned how the previously unknown entity was able to beat other, more established entities to obtain approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer for crypto. The members have directed their inquiries to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a letter signed by 23 House Financial Services Lawmakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several questions have been raised regarding the context of Prometheum&rsquo;s approval, especially since the approval came shortly after a joint hearing held by the House Financial Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on digital assets. The letter stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The timing of the approval raises concerns that it was aimed at demonstrating that legislation is not needed because there is a workable regulatory framework for the custody of digital asset securities.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

A Play By Gensler?&nbsp;
<p>The letter has also flagged serious concerns about whether the Securities and Exchange Commission put Prometheum up as a poster firm to shore up SEC Chair Cary Gensler&rsquo;s argument that no new laws were required to regulate the crypto space in the United States. The approval comes just before McHenry&rsquo;s committee is about to send the digital assets legislation to the house floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Prometheum executives have insisted there is nothing to be surprised about regarding the approval. They added that they followed the registration process step-by-step, just like other firms looking for approval. Prometheum&rsquo;s co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, has also insisted that the firm would go about demonstrating the right way to build a crypto platform that is also fully compliant with current laws and regulations. In response to the letter, the company released a statement, responding,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prometheum purpose-built its technology with the goal to develop a market infrastructure for digital asset securities that is compliant with the federal securities laws. This technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.&rdquo;</p>

Lawmakers Wary Of Prometheum&nbsp;
<p>The Republican lawmakers are the latest to call for more information and an investigation into the sudden approval of Prometheum, a company that has not done any trading as yet. Several other Republican members of the Senate have called for greater scrutiny of the prevailing situation. Republican lawmaker Thomas Tuberville has alleged that the company may have provided false testimony to Congress or violated several US Securities Laws. Meanwhile, Democrat lawmaker Ritchie Torres has requested an investigation of the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>
Prometheum&rsquo;s China Connection&nbsp;
<p>Prometheum has previously collaborated with the Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain Inc. to develop a blockchain trading software, a point that has been noted by lawmakers. While the collaboration has been concluded, reports have highlighted the involvement of a Chinese firm during Prometheum&rsquo;s early days. According to several reports, a Chinese entity owns a portion of the company and even has a representative, Feng Ziao, as a director at Prometheum. Lawmakers have also pointed to the connection between Wanxiang and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has led to significant concerns about national security and data privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kaplan&rsquo;s posts on social media have also garnered considerable attention. Kaplan&rsquo;s views closely align with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission and differ from those taken by crypto-space members. Kaplan has insisted that existing Federal Securities Laws are sufficient to regulate crypto. Kaplan and other top executives at Prometheum&rsquo;s connections with the Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA have also been discussed.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>GSR, the oldest market maker in the crypto space, is feeling the full impact of the ongoing bear market, with multiple top executives, including the CFO, departing the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company had also announced a staff cut in October 2022, terming them as a part of &ldquo;structural changes&rdquo; in the organization.&nbsp;</p>
Top Executives Depart&nbsp;
<p>As crypto&rsquo;s largest market maker retreats in the face of the bear market onslaught, several high-level executives, including C-level and department heads, are headed toward the exit. According to sources, the retrenchment is having a major impact on one of the industry&rsquo;s oldest and best-known players and one that is extremely prominent in the US markets. The most recent and maybe the most high-profile departure from the firm is its Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Hugh. Hugh joined GSR in 2021 and played a pivotal role in building the company&rsquo;s finance function. Hugh has so far not commented on his departure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other high-level executives leaving the company include GSR&rsquo;s Global Head of Product, Benoit Bosc, and its Director of Trading Operations, Aman Bhalla. Bosc had taken over the sales role from Michael Bressler, a highly experienced TradeFi executive from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Bressler had joined GSR in 2021, becoming the company&rsquo;s sales head in 2021. However, Bressler left the firm in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
Other Notable Departures&nbsp;
<p>Other notable departures from the company include Jake Dwyer. Dwyer had joined the firm in 2021 and was tasked with leading GSR&rsquo;s DeFi and venture initiatives. Trader Quentin Dubois and the head of Quant Trading, Romain Bernard, have also exited the company, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Director of Business Development at GSR, Jeff Stern, has also left the organization. All of these departures occurred this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Dwyer confirmed his departure from GSR, the others, including Bhalla, Bosc, Vince, Barnard, and Dubois, have not commented on the matter. A spokesperson from GSR commented on the matter, stating that the company will look to evolve with the fast-moving crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;GSR has been at the center of crypto markets for ten years &mdash; markets that are fast-moving and volatile. We owe it to our clients to continue adapting and evolving to keep pace with the speed of crypto, and we will continue to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spokesperson also confirmed the departures of Bosc and Bhalla. However, they added that they will continue in their respective roles until the end of August and ensure a smooth transition of their respective roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our business operations and strategy have naturally evolved to respond to changing market conditions, but there has been no restructuring.&rdquo;</p>

Crypto Winter Takes Its Toll&nbsp;
<p>GSR had laid off around 10% of its workforce in October 2022, adding that the layoffs were part of structural changes. In doing so, the company became the latest in a long line of crypto firms that had to curtail their growth and ambitions in the face of a crippling crypto winter. Companies and exchanges operating have sanctioned a wave of layoffs as they look to navigate the crypto bear market. The firm had undertaken an aggressive expansion drive, growing its workforce to over 200 and reaching a peak of 300 before the layoffs took place. A source familiar with the firm and its operations stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The executive team is mostly friends, and I think it threw off a lot of the momentum GSR built in the previous cycle. They hired a lot of corporate Wall Street executives that came in at the top of the bull market, which ended up costing the firm dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the c-suite executives have links with Winton, CEO Jacob Palmstierna&rsquo;s former employer, or Goldman Sachs, the former employer of Rich Rosenblum and Cristian Gil. Staff at GSR believes that the firm got too big too soon and the team needs to be better streamlined. A GSR spokesperson stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While last year&rsquo;s bear market created challenges for all crypto companies, our long-term belief in the space hasn&rsquo;t changed. We have continued investing and hiring in high-conviction areas and have maintained a world-class team of TradFi and DeFi talent that is uniquely positioned for another decade of growth.&rdquo;</p>

Scaling Back US Operations&nbsp;
<p>The firm is also focusing on scaling back its US operations. Multiple sources have attributed the retreat to a combination of a number of factors. These include a decreasing appetite for token listings, a high cost of talent acquisition, and concerns around regulations. According to a source, the company has also moved from its New York office, taking up a space in Jersey City instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one point, it was probably their largest office, and they have been scaling it down meaningfully. They have given up their New York office and have a smaller space in Jersey City.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto media outlet CoinDesk has cut its editorial staff by 45% as its parent company DCG prepares to introduce strategic investors. </p>
<p>Rumours that DCG is negotiating a sale of its crypto media outlet CoinDesk have been circulating for a while. Reports by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) claim that the crypto conglomerate was reportedly finalizing a $125 million deal to sell a portion of the company. DCG would reportedly retain a stake in the company.</p>
CoinDesk Announced Staff Cuts
<p>Reports by crypto news outlet The Block claim that CoinDesk let go of 45% of its editorial staff as its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), prepares for a partial sale of the company. DCG purchased CoinDesk in 2016 for $500,000. The company was established in 2013.</p>
<p>In an internal memo viewed by The Block, the firm was soon to have an &ldquo;all-hands&rdquo; meeting to discuss the layoffs.</p>
<p>In an email, Kevin Worth, CoinDesk CEO, told staff:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The purpose of the meeting is to inform everyone that today several roles, predominantly in our media team, were impacted by a reduction in force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an incredibly difficult message to send to everyone over email and yet I also wanted everyone at CoinDesk to know as soon as possible what is happening today. This was a required step to ensure a financially sound business moving forward and to set us on the path to close the deal to sell CoinDesk Inc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to The Block&rsquo;s report, which cites someone familiar with the matter, CoinDesk would let go of 45% of its editorial team or 20 people.</p>
DCG Will Retain a Stake in CoinDesk
<p>CoinDesk recently appointed financial advisers to &ldquo;help bring on new institutional and strategic investors&rdquo; alongside its parent company. DCG has faced severe pressure from crypto exchange Gemini over a dispute involving the &ldquo;Earn&rdquo; program. In July, Gemini announced that it had filed a lawsuit against DCG.</p>
<p>The reports from the WSJ indicated CoinDesk was in the final stages of a partial sale of the company to a crypto syndicate led by crypto investor Matthew Roszak of Tally Capital. As part of the $125 million deal, DCG would retain a share of CoinDesk.</p>

DCG would reportedly retain a stake in the company.</p>
CoinDesk Announced Staff Cuts
<p>Reports by crypto news outlet The Block claim that CoinDesk let go of 45% of its editorial staff as its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), prepares for a partial sale of the company. DCG purchased CoinDesk in 2016 for $500,000. The company was established in 2013.</p>
<p>In an internal memo viewed by The Block, the firm was soon to have an &ldquo;all-hands&rdquo; meeting to discuss the layoffs.</p>
<p>In an email, Kevin Worth, CoinDesk CEO, told staff:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The purpose of the meeting is to inform everyone that today several roles, predominantly in our media team, were impacted by a reduction in force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an incredibly difficult message to send to everyone over email and yet I also wanted everyone at CoinDesk to know as soon as possible what is happening today. This was a required step to ensure a financially sound business moving forward and to set us on the path to close the deal to sell CoinDesk Inc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to The Block&rsquo;s report, which cites someone familiar with the matter, CoinDesk would let go of 45% of its editorial team or 20 people.</p>
DCG Will Retain a Stake in CoinDesk
<p>CoinDesk recently appointed financial advisers to &ldquo;help bring on new institutional and strategic investors&rdquo; alongside its parent company. DCG has faced severe pressure from crypto exchange Gemini over a dispute involving the &ldquo;Earn&rdquo; program. In July, Gemini announced that it had filed a lawsuit against DCG.</p>
<p>The reports from the WSJ indicated CoinDesk was in the final stages of a partial sale of the company to a crypto syndicate led by crypto investor Matthew Roszak of Tally Capital. As part of the $125 million deal, DCG would retain a share of CoinDesk.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase has announced its official entry into the Canadian market in a strategic move that involved the integration of Interac payment rails.&nbsp;</p>
Expanding Horizons: Canada as a Crypto Hub
<p>On Monday, Coinbase executives Nana Murugesan and newly-appointed Lucas Matheson penned a joint announcement declaring Coinbase's decision to venture into Canada's crypto landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statement also addressed the various factors why Canada was chosen as the next Coinbase outpost, calling it the world's third-most crypto-aware nation, with a thriving local tech ecosystem that firmly positions it as a potential global leader in the crypto-economy. The duo pulled up the Ontario Securities Commission's survey highlights, which revealed that over 30% of Canadians are gearing up to explore crypto assets within the year.</p>
Pioneering Innovations for Canadians
<p>According to the statement, Coinbase will be presenting a slew of innovative offerings to cater to the Canadian market. The integration of Interac payment rails takes center stage as it would enable Canadian users to effortlessly deposit and withdraw funds (CAD) to and from their Coinbase wallets in an attempt to make the crypto experience more accessible to Canadians.</p>
<p>They also revealed the launch of Coinbase One, which is being touted to feature benefits like a 30-day trial period, zero trading fees, enhanced staking rewards, and priority support.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase Appoints New Canada Director
<p>In March 2023, Coinbase appointed Lucas Matheson as the Country Director for Canada. Matheson, who has experience leading operation and financial teams, will be focusing on Coinbase&rsquo;s offerings for Canadians by working with partners, government, and regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the regulatory front, the company has also signed an Enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking in order to highlight its dedication to regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firm has almost 200 full-time employees at the Canadian tech hub, thus making the most of local talent and fostering a user-centric platform tailored to Canadian citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Other Crypto Firms In Canada
<p>Other leading crypto firms have also turned to Canada, especially in the wake of growing regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Crypto exchange Kraken has demonstrated its commitment to Canada's financial sector by signing a pre-registration undertaking (PRU) with the Ontario Securities Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a few of them, like Binance and ByBit, have had to wrap up their Canada operations, citing an unfavorable regulatory climate in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, Coinbase's official launch in Canada, backed by Interac payment integration, Coinbase One, and a strong commitment to local engagement, ushers in a new chapter in Canada's crypto journey. This move is a testament to Coinbase's unwavering dedication to fostering financial empowerment through innovative crypto solutions.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) was more volatile early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 29369.12 level, representing the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 29072.96 to 29665.27.&nbsp; &nbsp;After steadily climbing to the 29665 area and reversing lower, BTC/USD appreciated from the 29227.79 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 28850 to 29462.90.&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical trading was recently evident when buying pressure strengthened around the 28754 area, a previous downside price objective associated with selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 areas.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon and Solana are two of DeFi&rsquo;s most popular altcoins. In 2023, both projects have grown their ecosystems, with Solana taking a slight lead over Polygon in terms of market cap. Now, however, a new cryptocurrency could outperform both.</p>
<p>Everlodge is a new DeFi project set to release in 2023. It has revolutionary utility and could offer returns of 280% during its presale. Here&rsquo;s why analysts are choosing Everlodge over Polygon and Solana.</p>
<p class="s6">Find Out How To Buy Everlodge (ELDG)</p>
Everlodge Brings Travel Properties To Web3 
<p>Everlodge is a DeFi property marketplace designed for luxury villas, vacation homes, and hotels. Its marketplace lets individuals buy, sell and invest in fractional real estate on the blockchain. To achieve this, a property is minted into an NFT and fractionalized.</p>
<p>For example, A $2 million luxury villa in Spain could be fractionalized into 20 fragments. Each can then be purchased or sold for $200,000, reducing the amount an investor needs for their investment.</p>
<p>Everlodge will also offer a launchpad designed for property developers. This launchpad will let developers raise capital from the Everlodge community to kick-start developments. Investors will then profit from getting involved in developments early to maximize their returns.</p>
<p>In addition to its launchpad and property marketplace, Everlodge will offer an exclusive rewards club. As part of the rewards club, investors will earn free nightly stays across properties throughout the Everlodge ecosystem. Several tiers will be available and will determine the properties and number of stays an individual gets. Members aren&rsquo;t obliged to use this timehowever. Instead, it can be sold on third-party platforms such as Airbnb to generate another income source.</p>
<p>Investors who co-own properties will be able to use their NFT as collateral to obtain other short term loans. This will give them access to more capital to quickly scale their property portfolio.</p>
<p>ELDG tokens will be used throughout the Everlodge ecosystem. They will grant holders a number of benefits such as staking bonuses, discounts on property and free stays at properties. Tokens will start at $0.01 when the Everlodge presale begins, and are expected to hit $0.035 before tokens are launched on mainstream exchanges.</p>
Experts Predict That Solana Will Pass $30 
<p>Solana&rsquo;s total value locked has consistently increased since the start of 2023. Over the last month, Solana&rsquo;s TVL has stayed above $1 billion. This indicates that confidence in Solana is starting to build following the project's crash in June.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Solana&rsquo;s value has also increased. In the last 30 days, Solana has increased in value by 22.44%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $23.59. Given its steady increase, experts believe that Solana will pass $30 in August.</p>
Confidence In Polygon Remains High Despite POL Proposal
<p>Polygon&rsquo;s price increases slowed over the last week after Polygon founders proposed an upgrade to Polygon's native token. This proposal has caused Polygon to decrease in value by 2.24%, andcreated confusion throughout the Polygon community.</p>
<p>The development team has proposed replacing MATIC tokens with POL. This new token would be used throughout the Polygon network, though investors are questioning why the upgrade needs to be made.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, confidence in Polygon continues to rise. PancakeSwap recently launched its v3 on the Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta, which is a huge win for the Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>Currently trading at $0.6897, analysts believe that Polygon will increase to $1 by the end of the year. Despite this increase, experts still predict that Everlodge will be a more profitable investment.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Amidst the wavering performance of well-known Memecoins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Pomerdoge (POMD) emerges as a fresh attraction. Currently, in its presale phase, Pomerdoge is quickly becoming the new memeCoin magnet, demonstrating the unending appetite for new ventures in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Let's take a closer look.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Pomerdoge (DOGE): Early Adopters and The Race to Buy POMD
<p class="s5">Pomerdoge is breaking new ground in the meme cryptocurrency arena, coupling the allure of meme culture with a dynamic play-to-earn gaming environment and a sound token structure. Although it bears some resemblance to Shiba Inu as an Ethereum-based meme coin, Pomerdoge's appeal lies in its unique offerings.</p>
<p class="s5">At the heart of Pomerdoge's distinctiveness is an integrated ecosystem, featuring an engaging P2E gaming platform and a bustling marketplace called Pomerplace. The gaming platform enables players from across the globe to compete and earn rewards, while Pomerplace provides a vibrant hub for trading in-game assets.</p>
<p class="s5">The driving force behind this multifaceted universe is the POMD token. Not just a means of exchange, POMD unlocks various rewards and special functionalities within the platform, which promotes user loyalty and sustainable growth for the project.</p>
<p class="s5">Financial pundits are forecasting an astonishing 5,000% surge in Pomerdoge's value come 2024. This is, in part, due to the current low price of $0.07 during the first phase of the presale.</p>
<p class="s5">By joining the presale, early adopters can cement their position in what promises to be an exciting new chapter in the world of meme cryptocurrencies. More than 100 million POMDtokens have already been purchased, and the number is increasing daily.</p>
Pitting Shiba Inu (SHIB)'s Limited Utility Against Pomerdoge(POMD)'s Offerings
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu burst onto the cryptocurrency scene with a bang as it tried to topple Dogecoin as the biggest meme coin. Shiba Inu has been a wild ride since then, with its value shooting up and crashing back down multiple times in the span of a few months.</p>
<p class="s5">Shiba Inu is now trading 88% below its all-time high at just $0.00001030. The euphoria and frenzy that once surrounded Shiba Inu seem to have dimmed, primarily because its intrinsic value appeared limited. Shiba Inu lacked a clear utility beyond being just a meme, rendering it no different from Dogecoin.</p>
<p class="s5">This is in stark contrast to Pomerdoge, which offers both a meme coin and an array of practical uses. As the Shiba Inu craze subsides, many investors are turning their attention towards Pomerdoge &mdash; a new and exciting project that offers investors the best of both worlds.</p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): Analyzing the Shift in Investor Interest
<p class="s5">The crypto realm is currently under a bearish spell, and Dogecoin is taking the brunt of it. Dogecoin is now a whopping 90% under its 2021 peak of $0.79, with a 2% decline in the last 24 hours alone.</p>
<p class="s5">Dogecoin may not tout cutting-edge technology, but it boasts a position within the top 20 coins on CoinMarketCap, largely thanks to its humorous origin and loyal following of supporters.</p>
<p class="s5">However, this lack of utility limits just how high Dogecoin can go. Analysts predict that Dogecon will continue to range in the tight trading window of $0.050 to $0.010 in the near term. It seems Dogecoin might have to wait in the wings for the next altcoin surge to steal the spotlight.</p>
<p class="s5">In comparison, Pomerdoge is now emerging as the new shining star within meme coins. As evidenced by the sale of 100 million tokens already, Pomerdoge is not affected by the current bearish market trends that have weighed down on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is in the news once again after a recent development revealed that he had allegedly used stolen customer funds to donate over $100 million to political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
FTX Founder's Troubles Deepen
<p>Federal prosecutors have filed a fresh indictment against Bankman-Fried, charging him with seven counts of conspiracy and fraud related to the collapse of his crypto exchange. According to the indictment, Bankman-Fried contributed over $100 million of funds stolen from customer accounts on the FTX exchange to donate to political campaigns in the run-up to the 2022 U.S. midterm elections to influence softer crypto legislations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange is already under legal scrutiny over charges of pilfering billions in FTX customer funds to offset losses at Alameda Research, his crypto-focused hedge fund.&nbsp;</p>
Political Leanings And Opaque Donations
<p>The 31-year-old entrepreneur, who previously pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, is now confronted with new allegations that he misappropriated customer funds for political donations.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried reportedly made substantial political donations in 2022, with a CBS News analysis suggesting the figure exceeded $40 million. Although the majority of these contributions were made to Democratic candidates and causes, he stated that Bankman-Fried had also supported Republicans through undisclosed "dark" donations.</p>
Lobbying Efforts And Hidden Agendas
<p>The indictment highlights Bankman-Fried's alleged use of FTX's influence and connections to push for cryptocurrency-friendly regulations. He purportedly directed fellow FTX executives to make donations aimed at circumventing contribution limits, with the goal of supporting legislation that would enable FTX to continue accepting customer deposits and growing its operations.</p>
<p>The indictment claims that Bankman-Fried orchestrated the donations in a covert manner, transferring funds from FTX's sister trading firm, Alameda, to the personal bank accounts of FTX executives. These executives would then make donations under their own names, evading restrictions on certain political contributions and enhancing FTX's political clout.</p>
Legal Maneuvering And Upcoming Trial
<p>While prosecutors initially charged Bankman-Fried with violating U.S. campaign finance laws, they later dropped this charge in light of the Bahamas' refusal to extradite him on that basis. Despite this setback, prosecutors have indicated their intention to file a new indictment that would clarify the allegations of an illegal campaign finance scheme as part of the broader fraud and money laundering charges.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ordered Bankman-Fried's incarceration prior to his scheduled trial on October 2. The decision was made based on probable cause to believe that he tampered with witnesses on two occasions. Previously confined to his parents' home in Palo Alto, California, on a $250 million bond, Bankman-Fried now faces a more restrictive situation in the lead-up to his trial.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust and some affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday. </p>
<p>Las Vegas-based cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this week after Nevada regulators placed it into receivership in June.</p>
Prime Trust Records Significant Deficit on Its Books
<p>Nevada&rsquo;s Financial Institutions Division (NFID) placed crypto custodian Prime Trust into receivership, took control of the business, and froze its operations and businesses. Regulators decided to step in after it determined the company was insolvent and could not serve its customers.</p>
<p>Prime Trust said in a filing that it has between 25,000 to 50,000 creditors and estimates its liabilities to be between $100 million and $500 million. The firm added its assets are worth $50 million to $100 million.</p>
<p>The Chapter 11 filing indicates John Guedry, the former president of the Bank of Nevada, will act as a receiver and lead the restructuring committee. Judge Susan Johnson of the Eighth Judicial Court of the State of Nevada will oversee the bankruptcy proceedings. Prime Trust will continue in their role as &ldquo;debtors-in-possession&rdquo; under the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing its bankruptcy, Prime Trust said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Company, under the supervision and direction of the Special Committee, continues to manage their businesses as &ldquo;debtors-in-possession&rdquo; under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It added,</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Company intends to file a number of motions with the Bankruptcy Court designed to facilitate the Company&rsquo;s orderly evaluation of all strategic alternatives, including potentially a sale of the Company&rsquo;s assets and operations as a going concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regulators claim Prime Trust misused customer funds to pay withdrawals since December 2021 after the firm lost access to several customer crypto wallets.</p>
<p>Prime&rsquo;s voluntary bankruptcy filing comes as no surprise. In a press statement, the NFID commented on its decision to place the firm under receivership:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Nevada Financial Institutions Division (&ldquo;NFID&rdquo;) was actively monitoring the solvency of Prime Trust, LLC (&ldquo;Prime&rdquo;) in anticipation of a potential acquisition or merger.&nbsp;Ultimately, Prime failed to safeguard assets under its custody and cannot meet all client withdrawals. As such, Prime has breached its fiduciary duties to its clients, in violation of Nevada trust laws. NFID&rsquo;s primary objective is to preserve any enterprise value remaining in Prime for the benefit of Prime&rsquo;s clients.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several of the company&rsquo;s affiliates, including Prime Core Technologies Inc., Prime Trust, LLC, Prime IRA LLC and Prime Digital LLC, also filed for bankruptcy relief.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Singapore&rsquo;s central bank has announced the release of a revised regulatory framework to ensure stability for single-currency stablecoins regulated in the city-state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The framework outlines requirements that issuers need to meet to be deemed as regulated by the monetary authority of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
Better Regulatory Clarity&nbsp;
<p>The revised framework was announced on the 15th of August and is primarily aimed at non-bank issued stablecoins that are pegged to the value of the Singapore Dollar, or G10 currencies, including the British Pound, Euro, and the United States Dollar, and whose circulation is greater than 5 million Singapore Dollars. The Monetary Authority of Singapore stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stablecoins are digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one or more specified fiat currencies. When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the &ldquo;on-chain&rdquo; purchase and sale of digital assets. MAS&rsquo; stablecoin regulatory framework will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore Dollar or any G10 currency that is issued in Singapore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the Singapore central bank&rsquo;s financial supervision deputy managing director, Ho Hern Shin, the framework helps to establish and facilitate stablecoin use as a credible digital medium of exchange and a bridge between the traditional and digital currency ecosystems. Shin also urged stablecoin issuers to prepare for compliance if they wished for their stablecoin to be labeled as regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Framework&nbsp;
<p>The revised regulatory framework lists several requirements for stablecoin issuers. These include redemption timelines, reserve management, disclosures, and capital requirements. According to the MAS, reserve assets will be subject to requirements depending on their valuation, composition, custody, and audit. Stablecoin issuers will also have to maintain a minimum base capital and liquid assets to stave off any risk of insolvency. Stablecoin issuers will also be required to return the par value of the stablecoins to holders within five business days following a redemption request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore also observed that only those issuers who could fulfill the revised requirements could apply to be regulated by the MAS. According to the country&rsquo;s central bank, this label would help distinguish regulated stablecoins from non-regulated ones in the market. It also warned that those representing a token or stablecoin to be certified by the Monetary Authority of Singapore would also be subject to penalties defined in the new framework. The penalties include prison time, fines, as well as the addition on an alert list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Penny Chai, VP of Business Development for Sumsub in APAC, reiterates the importance of crypto businesses prioritizing AML compliance processes:</p>
<p>"Singapore's aim to establish comprehensive regulations for stablecoins is a significant step towards fostering a secure and transparent digital currency environment - the move sets a noteworthy example for other jurisdictions. Stablecoins have surpassed $100 billion in market value, according to&nbsp;recent reports, therefore the need for regulatory clarity is paramount as the market continues to grow.Failing to adhere to this regulation could potentially result in fraudulent activities due to the inability to identify suspicious users, leading to financial penalties and substantial reputational harm for cryptocurrency businesses operating in Singapore and broader markets, APAC and further beyond. Companies must prioritise establishing crypto transaction monitoring tools and comprehensive AML compliance and verification procedures, both during the onboarding process and beyond."</p>
Attempts At Regulating Stablecoins
<p>The revised framework takes into account feedback from a public consultation held in October 2022. However, the MAS will still need to hold consultations, while parliament would need to pass amendments to enforce the revised framework. The MAS highlighted the risks involved in investing in crypto last year following the collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) and Luna tokens. The United States is also looking to pass regulations regarding stablecoins. The United States House Financial Services Committee had recently proposed a bill that would establish a federal regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill proposes that the United States Federal Reserve draw up requirements for the issuance of stablecoins while maintaining the authority of state regulators. The bill was modified after several democrats raised concerns that stablecoin issuers could simply bypass stricter federal oversight by opting to be regulated by state regulatory authorities.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius received permission to seek creditor approval for its proposed bankruptcy plan. </p>
<p>According to reports by Bloomberg and Reuters, bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network was granted permission by a US bankruptcy judge to send its proposed bankruptcy plan to its creditors. Celsius&rsquo; proposed strategy will see it exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy as an entity its creditors own.</p>
Creditors Have Sufficient Information to Vote on Bankruptcy Plan
<p>On Monday, during a US Bankruptcy Court hearing in Manhattan, Judge Martin Glenn approved Celsius&rsquo;s disclosure agreement and solicitation material, noting the firm had provided creditors with enough information to vote on its bankruptcy proposal.</p>
<p>Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2022, leaving customers with uncertainty over the outcome of their funds. The firm reached two settlements in July which will allow the lender to exit bankruptcy proceedings and return customer assets. In addition to its proposed bankruptcy plan, a confirmation hearing is scheduled for October to deal with Celsius&rsquo; reorganization plan. If all goes well, customers may see disbursements of their assets before the end of the year.</p>
<p>When Celsius filed for bankruptcy, it had 600,000 customers who invested around $4.4 billion in interest-bearing Celsius accounts.</p>
Fahrenheit Group to Take Control of Remaining Business Lines
<p>Under Celsius&rsquo; bankruptcy plan, retail customers will receive some crypto deposits, and the Fahrenheit Group will take over the lender remaining business line, including bitcoin mining and staking. The Fahrenheit consortium recently won the bid to acquire Celsius.</p>
<p>The lender suggests that most of its customers with interest-bearing Earn accounts will receive a 67% recovery. The recovery will consist of the return of liquid crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, equity shares in the new entity, and proceeds from the litigation against Celsius&rsquo; founder Alex Mashinsky and other executives.</p>
<p>Mashinsky was arrested and sued by US regulators and charged with seven counts of securities, commodities, and wire fraud, as well as a conspiracy charge to manipulate the lender&rsquo;s native token, $CEL.</p>
<p>During an appearance in federal court, Mashinsky pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.</p>
<p>The lender&rsquo;s creditors have until September 20 to submit votes on the proposal.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The SEC has taken decisive action against Crowe U.K. LLP, a pro-crypto London-based audit firm over the auditing of music streaming service Akazoo.</p>
<p>The firm's CEO, Nigel Bostock, and senior auditor, Matthew Stallabrass, who advocate for wider crypto adoption, have also been implicated for their roles in a flawed audit of the music streaming entity, Akazoo Limited. All parties involved have opted for a settlement with the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
Akazoo revenue overstated
<p>Diving into the details, the SEC's findings reveal that Crowe U.K. had given Akazoo's 2018 financial statements a clean bill of health. However, post Akazoo's public debut in 2019 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition entity, discrepancies emerged.</p>
<p>Akazoo's 2018 financial records boasted a whopping $120 million in revenue, a figure that was later debunked, revealing only trivial revenue figures. The SEC's probe highlighted that Crowe U.K.'s audit team lacked the requisite experience and training in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The oversight became evident when the team missed glaring warning signs, such as accepting fabricated agreements and dubious confirmation letters from Akazoo without the necessary scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
Failings and penalties
<p>The SEC's findings also spotlighted the roles of Bostock and Stallabrass. Bostock, as the lead for the Akazoo audit, was found lacking in his supervisory duties, documentation, and professional care. On the other hand, Stallabrass, responsible for reviewing the audit's quality, failed to conduct a comprehensive review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric Werner, the Regional Director of the Fort Worth Regional Office, commented on the situation, emphasising the role of Crowe U.K. in lending an unwarranted legitimacy to Akazoo, facilitating its entry into the public trading arena. He stressed the SEC's commitment to holding such gatekeepers accountable to prevent financial deceptions from infiltrating public markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the settlement, without admitting to any wrongdoing, Crowe U.K., Bostock, and Stallabrass have agreed to pay penalties amounting to $750,000, $25,000, and $10,000, respectively. They've also committed to refraining from any future violations related to the Exchange Act and Regulation S-X. Additionally, Crowe U.K. will voluntarily withdraw its PCAOB registration and introduce measures concerning new client acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Bostock and Stallabrass face suspensions from practising before the SEC as accountants, with potential reinstatements after five and two years, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The firm's CEO, Nigel Bostock, and senior auditor, Matthew Stallabrass, who advocate for wider crypto adoption, have also been implicated for their roles in a flawed audit of the music streaming entity, Akazoo Limited. All parties involved have opted for a settlement with the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
Akazoo revenue overstated
<p>Diving into the details, the SEC's findings reveal that Crowe U.K. had given Akazoo's 2018 financial statements a clean bill of health. However, post Akazoo's public debut in 2019 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition entity, discrepancies emerged.</p>
<p>Akazoo's 2018 financial records boasted a whopping $120 million in revenue, a figure that was later debunked, revealing only trivial revenue figures. The SEC's probe highlighted that Crowe U.K.'s audit team lacked the requisite experience and training in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The oversight became evident when the team missed glaring warning signs, such as accepting fabricated agreements and dubious confirmation letters from Akazoo without the necessary scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
Failings and penalties
<p>The SEC's findings also spotlighted the roles of Bostock and Stallabrass. Bostock, as the lead for the Akazoo audit, was found lacking in his supervisory duties, documentation, and professional care. On the other hand, Stallabrass, responsible for reviewing the audit's quality, failed to conduct a comprehensive review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric Werner, the Regional Director of the Fort Worth Regional Office, commented on the situation, emphasising the role of Crowe U.K. in lending an unwarranted legitimacy to Akazoo, facilitating its entry into the public trading arena. He stressed the SEC's commitment to holding such gatekeepers accountable to prevent financial deceptions from infiltrating public markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the settlement, without admitting to any wrongdoing, Crowe U.K., Bostock, and Stallabrass have agreed to pay penalties amounting to $750,000, $25,000, and $10,000, respectively. They've also committed to refraining from any future violations related to the Exchange Act and Regulation S-X. Additionally, Crowe U.K. will voluntarily withdraw its PCAOB registration and introduce measures concerning new client acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Bostock and Stallabrass face suspensions from practising before the SEC as accountants, with potential reinstatements after five and two years, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has included crypto in its annual risk review for the first time, stating that crypto presents key risks and that it needs closer supervision.</p>
FDIC seeks more control over crypto companies
<p>The crypto industry may not be entirely happy with being closely supervised by the likes of the FDIC given that it came about as an alternative to a slow-moving banking system that does not provide a helpful service to clients.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the FDIC has the reins of power and will do what it will do in order to try and bring crypto under the control of regulators that are regulating on behalf of the incumbent system.</p>
<p>Banks are already working with crypto institutions, and others are contemplating such a move. Therefore, in collaboration with its fellow federal banking entities the FDIC has stated in its report that it is ready to delve further into how banks are getting involved in crypto, and with this knowledge provide full supervisory guidance.</p>
Perceived risks to banks
<p>In its report the FDIC talks of the &ldquo;dynamic nature of crypto-assets&rdquo;, and their &ldquo;rapid pace of innovation&rdquo;. The main risks for the banking sector, as perceived by the FDIC is the possibility of &ldquo;contagion&rdquo; which could spread over into banks with exposure to the sector, and also the &ldquo;run risk&rdquo; for banks that hold stablecoin reserves.</p>
<p>The report went on to specify that all FDIC supervised banks must notify the agency of any crypto related activities that they have or that they are planning to engage in. Examples were then given of firms that had made misleading claims as to the eligibility of FDIC insurance for certain crypto-assets. The report ended with what the authors saw as &ldquo;heightened liquidity risks&rdquo; due to what they saw as the &ldquo;unpredictability&rdquo; of deposit inflows and outflows.</p>
Opinion
<p>The FDIC is an organisation staffed by those from the existing financial system, and therefore it is biassed towards the protection of the banks within that system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no conversation as to how more failing banks might impact any crypto companies that are dealing with them, or how obliging crypto companies, or the banks that seek to deal with them, to jump through ever more complex regulatory hoops, might end up squashing the dynamism and innovation of crypto.</p>
<p>The FDIC is there to insure the funds of bank customers should their bank fail. However, without the money to guarantee the savings of the clients of more than one or two big banks should they fail - it might be asked: what is the point of this organisation anyway?</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Base project RocketSwap has shared an emergency plan with users as it looks to recover from a brute force hack that saw the protocol lose around 471 ETH, valued at around $865,000, on the 14th of August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team behind the project also plans on reaching out to the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
The Emergency Plan&nbsp;
<p>The team at RocketSwap explained in a post on X on the 15th of August, stating that they planned to redeploy a new farm contract, following which it would be open-sourced on-chain. The team stated that they would also be relinquishing mining rights, mostly of RCKT, and also reach out to the hackers in an attempt to negotiate a return of the stolen assets, This approach was taken by Curve, and several other decentralized protocols following the Curve exploit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The emergency programme agreed upon by the team is as follows. We plan to redeploy a new farm contract by dropping the proxy contract and open-sourcing it on-chain. The new farm will advance the production reduction plan by 0.075 per block. The team relinquishes minting rights and retains only low-risk rights to allocate new pools. Locked initial liquidity and 80k tokens will be extended for 1 year. The team will continue to roll out LaunchPad, with further updates planned. Telegram groups will be reopened after stabilization. Call on hackers to return assets to victims.&rdquo;</p>

The RocketSwap Hack&nbsp;
<p>On the 14th of April, a hacker managed to steal around 471 ETH, bridging it from Base to Ethereum. The activity was flagged by blockchain security firm PeckShield. The hacker then created 90 trillion LoveRCKT tokens before transferring them to Uniswap, along with 400 of the 471 ETH initially stolen. PeckShield detailed the hack in a post on X, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;#PeckShieldAlert The @RocketSwap_Labs exploiter has grabbed ~471 $ETH and bridged them from #Base to #Ethereum, and then created the token $LoveRCKT, the exploiter already supplied 90T $LoveRCKT and 400 $ETH to #Uniswap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>RocketSwap eventually confirmed the news on the same day, with PeckShield and another blockchain security firm, CertiK, providing additional details about the hack a few hours later. The attack was attributed to a brute force attack on RocketSwap&rsquo;s server, with the protocol stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a result of the team&rsquo;s investigation, We are sorry to inform you that the team needed to use offline signatures when deploying the launchpad and put the private keys on the server. A brute force hack of the server was detected, and due to the proxy contract used for the farm contract, there were multiple high-risk permissions that led to the transfer of the farm&rsquo;s assets. We shut down the farm to prevent further damage. The team is currently working on an emergency plan, and the Telegram group has been banned for the time being. The loss of farm assets is only a concern, DEX is not affected in any way.&rdquo;</p>

Growing Headaches On Base&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase&rsquo;s layer-2 blockchain Base has faced several issues since commencing operations. LeetSwap, a leading decentralized exchange on the Base blockchain, suspended trading operations after flagging a security vulnerability in their factory, leading to the suspicion of compromised pool liquidity. The pause was done so that the team could investigate the issue further. PeckShield reported that around 340 ETH was exploited from liquidity pairs on Base, showing the gravity of the prevailing situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the pause in trading by LeetSwap, the BALD memecoin suffered a significant drop in value. The crash occurred after the token&rsquo;s developer withdrew 6800 ETH, valued at around $12.5 million, from the liquidity pools on LeetSwap, raising several eyebrows and compounding the list of issues faced by LeetSwap. Furthermore, Coinbase is also dealing with its own set of regulatory challenges after finding itself as a target of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered Coinbase to stop all crypto trading, except for that of Bitcoin. When Coinbase questioned the decision made by the regulatory body, Coinbase filed a lawsuit against the exchange.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coca-Cola has launched its new exclusive NFT collection on Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network during the &ldquo;Onchain Summer&rdquo; festival.</p>
Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Masterpiece Campaign
<p>On Sunday, August 13, one of the most recognizable consumer brands in the world, Coca-Cola, revealed its new non-fungible tokens (NFT) collection on Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 blockchain called &ldquo;Base&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The collection is a part of Coca-Cola's global &ldquo;Masterpiece&rdquo; campaign which was partially created by the brand&rsquo;s AI platform known as &ldquo;Real Magic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Masterpiece&rsquo; is not a story in which Coke appears&hellip; Coke is the story,&rdquo; commented Pratik Thakar, Global Head of Creative Strategy and Integrated Content for Coca‑Cola. &ldquo;True to the spirit of the brand&mdash;and not unlike the way a synchronized supply chain collaborates to seamlessly deliver ice-cold Coca‑Cola to consumers at just the right time&mdash;a diverse collection of artwork spanning multiple genres, geographies and generations comes together to uplift a slumping teenager. Creating human connection and bringing enchantment to everyday moments is what &lsquo;Real Magic&rsquo; is all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Masterpiece NFT collection showcases the artwork featured in the brand&rsquo;s campaign, including Andy Warhol&rsquo;s iconic 1962 Coca‑Cola painting, classical pieces of timeless artists such as Edvard Munch&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Scream&rdquo; and Johannes Vermeer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Girl with a Pearl Earring,&rdquo;, as well as works of emerging artists such as Aket, Fatma Ramadan, and Vikram Kushwah.</p>
Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer
<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s new NFT collection has been offered for a limited time and presented as a part of the Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer event:</p>

<p>&ldquo;@CocaCola is bringing their Global Masterpiece campaign onchain with iconic works from leading artists,&rdquo; Coinbase announced on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>Onchain Summer is Coinbase's month-long celebration of its Layer-2 Blochcian Base which became available to the general public on August 9. Each day, the festival offers numerous onchain mints, stories, and activities related to art, culture, music, gaming, and more. Coca-Cola is undoubtedly the most recognizable brand presented on the list of Base&rsquo;s partners so far.</p>
Coca-Cola and NFTs
<p>This is not the first time the world-renowned soft drinks brand has ventured into the NFT space. Back in 2021, Coca-Cola auctioned off exclusive NFT collectibles with the aim of raising funds for Special Olympics International. At that time, the first Coca-Cola&rsquo;s NFT loot box was sold as a single asset for over $575,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s engagement with NFTs is meaningful for the whole cryptocurrency industry. As one of the largest global consumer brands, Coca-Cola could introduce many of its customers to the world of digital art and Web3. Besides, the beverage giant will likely play a big role in promoting Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network Base.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coca-Cola has launched its new exclusive NFT collection on Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network during the &ldquo;Onchain Summer&rdquo; festival.</p>
Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Masterpiece Campaign
<p>On Sunday, August 13, one of the most recognizable consumer brands in the world, Coca-Cola, revealed its new non-fungible tokens (NFT) collection on Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 blockchain called &ldquo;Base&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The collection is a part of Coca-Cola's global &ldquo;Masterpiece&rdquo; campaign which was partially created by the brand&rsquo;s AI platform known as &ldquo;Real Magic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Masterpiece&rsquo; is not a story in which Coke appears&hellip; Coke is the story,&rdquo; commented Pratik Thakar, Global Head of Creative Strategy and Integrated Content for Coca‑Cola. &ldquo;True to the spirit of the brand&mdash;and not unlike the way a synchronized supply chain collaborates to seamlessly deliver ice-cold Coca‑Cola to consumers at just the right time&mdash;a diverse collection of artwork spanning multiple genres, geographies and generations comes together to uplift a slumping teenager. Creating human connection and bringing enchantment to everyday moments is what &lsquo;Real Magic&rsquo; is all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Masterpiece NFT collection showcases the artwork featured in the brand&rsquo;s campaign, including Andy Warhol&rsquo;s iconic 1962 Coca‑Cola painting, classical pieces of timeless artists such as Edvard Munch&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Scream&rdquo; and Johannes Vermeer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Girl with a Pearl Earring,&rdquo;, as well as works of emerging artists such as Aket, Fatma Ramadan, and Vikram Kushwah.</p>
Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer
<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s new NFT collection has been offered for a limited time and presented as a part of the Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer event:</p>

<p>&ldquo;@CocaCola is bringing their Global Masterpiece campaign onchain with iconic works from leading artists,&rdquo; Coinbase announced on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>Onchain Summer is Coinbase's month-long celebration of its Layer-2 Blochcian Base which became available to the general public on August 9. Each day, the festival offers numerous onchain mints, stories, and activities related to art, culture, music, gaming, and more. Coca-Cola is undoubtedly the most recognizable brand presented on the list of Base&rsquo;s partners so far.</p>
Coca-Cola and NFTs
<p>This is not the first time the world-renowned soft drinks brand has ventured into the NFT space. Back in 2021, Coca-Cola auctioned off exclusive NFT collectibles with the aim of raising funds for Special Olympics International. At that time, the first Coca-Cola&rsquo;s NFT loot box was sold as a single asset for over $575,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s engagement with NFTs is meaningful for the whole cryptocurrency industry. As one of the largest global consumer brands, Coca-Cola could introduce many of its customers to the world of digital art and Web3. Besides, the beverage giant will likely play a big role in promoting Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network Base.</p>

<p>The Singapore Red Cross recently announced that it will now accept donations in cryptocurrencies via a partnership with Triple-A.</p>
Singapore Red Cross Enables Anonymous Crypto Donations
<p>In an effort to secure contributions from a whole new generation, the Singapore Red Cross entered into a partnership with Triple-A to enable the option of anonymous crypto donations. According to a press release, the organisation accepts Bitcoin, Ether, Tether and USD Coin.</p>

<p>Secretary general and CEO of the Singapore Red Cross, Benjamin William, commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By accepting digital currencies, we open our doors to a new segment of donors who are tech-savvy and wish to make a difference through their digital assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enabling cryptocurrency donations also opens more opportunities for the new generation of donors who are&nbsp;au fait&nbsp;with digital currencies to consider philanthropy and helping the vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donors can contribute with the four above tokens or donate via a separate solution from a Binance digital wallet.</p>
<p>Currently, crypto donations are not tax deductible.</p>
