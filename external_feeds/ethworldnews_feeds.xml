<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>An exploiter stole around $2.5 million in cryptocurrencies from Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium.</li><li>The team confirmed that a hacker withdrew liquidity pool tokens from its admin wallet on Friday.</li><li>The hacker swapped the stolen digital assets from Solana to Ethereum, per on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. </li></ul>



<p>Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium was exploited on Friday for around $2.5 million in digital assets, the project confirmed via a Twitter thread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Solana DEX, the project’s admin wallet was compromised and liquidity pool (LP) tokens were withdrawn without the team&#8217;s authorization. Raydium said the exploiter assumed “owner authority” in order to drain funds from the LP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nansen confirmed that LP tokens were stolen from the Solana DEX, including some $⅙ million in SOL. Further investigations into the matter are underway, said the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of the attack, the attacker held around $2 million in crypto. On-chain investigator ZachXBT noted that the exploiter moved the assets from Solana’s network to Ethereum, the largest altcoin blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Raydium Hack Spells Further Turbence For Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem</h2>



<p>Raydium’s TVL exceeded $45 million despite today’s $2.5 million hack, per data seen on the DEX’s liquidity pool dashboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Friday’s hack on the DEX highlighted pressure in Solana&#8217;s decentralized finance ecosystem. Solana DeFi was thrown into uncertainty after the crash of FTX. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried back’s Solana development, including massive investments in projects like Serum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solana’s total value locked (TVL) fell below $300 million shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11. The Solana Foundation also lost tens of millions stuck on the crypto exchange after withdrawals were paused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFTC, SEC, and U.S. Attorneys from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) have since <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> Bankman-Fried with fraud and money laundering. SBF was remanded to Bahamas correctional facilities after a judge <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-fights-extradition-to-united-states/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-fights-extradition-to-united-states/" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> his $250,000 bail request. </p>

<ul><li>Audit Firm Mazars recently halted operations for massive crypto exchanges, including Binance, Crypto.Com, and KuCoin, following FTX&#8217;s Collapse, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>.</li><li>Previous audit reports have been taken down from their website. </li><li>Binance saw a withdrawal of $1B earlier this week following fears of investigations from the US Justice Department. </li></ul>



<p>Audit Group Mazars is halting any work with crypto clients such as Binance, the world&#8217;s current largest crypto exchange. The crypto sector has been under enormous scrutiny recently following the fallout of the significant crypto exchanges FTX and FTX.US. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg </a>report, previous audit reports are currently inaccessible on Mazar&#8217;s website, as the links are broken.</p>



<p>The accounting firm, Mazars, was hired by Binance to conduct a &#8220;proof of reserves&#8221; report. A Binance statement on Friday confirmed that Mazars had indicated they would temporarily pause all work with global crypto clients, including clients such as Crypto.Com, KuCoin, and Binance.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221208065048/https://veritas.mazars.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20221208065048/https://veritas.mazars.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">website </a>responsible for crypto audits appears to be shut down, and Mazars has not issued any further statements.</p>



<p>Most big crypto exchanges, such as Crypto.Com, KuCoin, and Binance, have worked with Mazars to provide audit reports on their reserves in November, following the fallout of crypto exchange FTX.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Binance saw a withdrawal amount of over $1BN as fear in centralized exchanges is at an all-time high. &#8220;Over the past week, Binance passed a stress test that should give the community extraordinary comfort that their funds are secure,&#8221; Binance said on Friday, confirming it was able to fulfill recent withdrawals &#8220;without breaking stride.&#8221;</p>



<p>The following outflow followed due to recent probes by the U.S Justice Department holding Binance under investigation on Money Laundering and Tax Avoidance charges.</p>



<p>Binance previously confirmed it holds more than $60B in assets, ensuring that the funds should be sufficient to honor all withdrawals. Still, it is yet to provide a disclosure of its liabilities. This figure has also been confirmed by Nansen Data which shows that Binance has over 55.6B in asset reserves.</p>



<p>According to a statement shared by Binance on Friday, the exchange confirmed that it has attempted to reach out to multiple large auditing firms, including ones in the Big Four, which are currently unwilling to conduct a proof of reserve for a private company.  Binance is still looking for a firm willing to do so. The exchange did not commit to a timeline on when this would be achieved. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The OKB token shot up in value after Twitter CEO Elon Musk followed OKX&#8217;s account, the crypto exchange behind OKB.</li><li>OKB&#8217;s price rose as high as 7% by press time on the speculations that Musk might unveil crypto payments for Twitter.</li><li>Elon Musk does not follow Binance, another crypto exchange that invested $500 million in equity for his Twitter takeover.</li></ul>



<p>OKX utility token pumped in asset value after traders noticed Elon Musk followed the company’s account on Twitter. OKB is the native token for the OKX cryptocurrency exchange. Users can trade with OKB, using the coin to pay for fees and digital asset transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OKB surged over 72% on the back of Elon Musk’s follow. The token traded for around $24 at press time, per data pulled from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/okb" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinGecko</a>. It’s unclear why Musk followed OKX on the social network. OKX notably advertises its partnership with European Football giants Manchester City on Twitter.</p>

<p>Some crypto participants on Twitter speculated that the OKX follow affirms upcoming web 3.0 payment integrations for the social network. Musk is a known supporter of Dogecoin, a popular crypto meme coin also known as DOGE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hopes that Twitter will roll out support for several blockchain networks only increased after Elon purchased Twitter for $44 billion. Crypto exchange Binance invested $500 million in equity for Musk’s massive Twitter buy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao previously said Twitter&#8217;s best bet was to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cz-twitter-cryptos-dogecoin-bnb/">integrate</a> multiple blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Musk also suggested that payments on Twitter were a “no brainer”.</p>



<h2>Twitter Announces NFT Trading</h2>



<p>Twitter announced NFT trading days after Elon Musk bought the company in October. The feature promised to allow NFT traders to view, buy, and sell digital collectibles from their Twitter timeliness. Twitter’s so-called “NFT Tweet Tiles” <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/musks-twitter-nft-trading-tweet-tiles/">rolled</a> out on October 27 in beta for select Apple iOS and web users.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Elon Musk Riles Journalist With Suspensions</h2>



<p>Crypto participants noticed the following amid online tension between Musk and several journalists on the social network. Users were outraged after Twitter suspended several accounts of reporters who cover the tech billionaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asides from journalists, Twitter also suspended several other accounts including ElonJet, a profile that tracks Musk’s private jet. Musk claimed these accounts failed to comply with privacy policies and doxxing laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Cryptocurrency market maker Wintermute was appointed to the committee for unsecured FTX creditors.</li><li>Wintermute and eight other members form the committee, according to a court document seen by EthereumWorldNews.</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. on November 11, 2022.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Crypto market maker Wintermute was appointed to the unsecured creditor&#8217;s committee for FTX, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. According to the court document seen by EthereumWorldNews, the committee comprises nine members including Wintermute and GGC, and an entity owned by Genesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankruptcy filing revealed over a million creditors of the collapsed crypto exchange. SBF&#8217;s firm reportedly owes the top 50 creditors around $3 billion. Alameda Research had $8 billion in liabilities on the exchange, per a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complaint</a> from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>



<h2>Unsecured Creditors Committee</h2>

<p>Appointing a creditors committee is common with Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws in the United States. After crypto lender Celsius filed Chapter 11 back on July 13, the bankruptcy court <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-creditor-committee-misconduct/">appointed</a> the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors days after on July 27.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Charged With Fraud</h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on December 13, 2022. Bahamas law enforcement received notice of criminal charges from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). </p>



<p>Prosecutors <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged</a> SBF with fraud and money laundering. The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also filed similar charges. According to the CFTC&#8217;s complaint, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reallocated</a> FTX customer assets to Alameda Research, his trading firm. </p>



<p>FTX CEO John Ray told Congress that Alameda exposed client funds to huge margin trading losses.  The CFTC alleged that Alameda&#8217;s liabilities on FTX exceeded $8 billion. Charges from the SEC also accused SBF of defrauding customers, lenders, and investors. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was spotted in police custody outside a Bahamas court on December 14, 2022. The judge denied his lawyer&#8217;s request for a $250,000 bail. SBF&#8217;s next court date is February 8, 2023. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Alameda&#8217;s liabilities with crypto exchange FTX were masked on the orders of Sam Bankman-Fried, CFTC officials alleged.</li><li>Nishad Singh, a top executive in SBF&#8217;s crypto empire, supposedly developed code that redirected Alameda&#8217;s billions in liabilities to a &#8216;weird Korean account’.</li><li>The CFTC, DOJ, and SEC all charged Bankman-Fried with several counts of fraud following his arrest in the Bahamas. </li></ul>



<p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried allegedly colluded with other top executives to obscure billions in Alameda liability on the now bankruptcy crypto exchange. The findings made by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said SBF diverted his trading firm’s liability to a “weird Korean account”.</p>



<p>According to the CFTC, Alameda Research blew up around May/June 2022 after the firm failed to meet margin calls and loan obligations. Crypto prices slumped around the same time due to Terra’s implosion. Celsius and Three Arrows Capital also collapsed shortly after, further crippling crypto asset prices and triggering mass liquidations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried told FTX executives to re-engineer Alameda’s assets and liabilities to “the weird Korean account” or “our Korean friend’s account”, per the CFTC’s filing. At the time, Alameda Research&#8217;s liabilities on the crypto exchange were estimated at $8 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A separate <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/ftx-executives-used-korea-account-to-mask-giant-alameda-liabilities?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> from Bloomberg alleged that Nishad Singh oversaw this process. Singh’s Github account deployed code linked to the so-called “Korean Account”. Sources previously claimed that SBF and Singh were in charge of the code used at the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alameda was afforded nigh-uncapped lending privileges via the Korean account, the CFTC filed. The federal regulator also alleged that an “allow negative flag” line of code <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/">allowed </a>Alameda to trade assets without actually holding sufficient funds or balances.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Founder Under Fire From CFTC, DOJ, and SEC</h2>



<p>Three U.S. authorities charged former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried with fraud and money laundering. Following his arrest on December 13, the U.S. prosecutors from the Southern District of New York (SDNY), the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/">SEC</a>), and the CFTC all filed <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">charges </a>against SBF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bankrupt crypto tycoon was remanded at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services (BDOCS) after a judge denied him bail. SBF will appear before a judge on February 8, 2023, as part of the prosecution and extradition process. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Alameda Research also had unlimited access to customer accounts among other special privileges at the FTX crypto exchange.</li><li>The CFTC&#8217;s complaint against Sam Bankman-Fried cited insider information, chat logs, and internal conversations as evidence for its lawsuit.</li><li>Charges were also filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. </li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said that Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading behemoth, was insolvent as of May/June 2022 despite allegedly using customer funds to finance debts and loans.</p>



<p>On Tuesday following SBF’s arrest, the CFTC filed a formal complaint against Bankman-Fried for committing fraud among other crimes. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">filed </a>charges against SBF on December 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the CFTC, Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives gave special access to Alameda. SBF’s trading firm was exempt from liquidation rules thanks to specific code written into FTX’s trading engine, per the complaint. The regulator added that Alameda could also open positions and order transactions without insufficient asset balances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alameda could borrow without limit on FTX, said the CFTC. The filing noted that Alameda’s borrow limit, or lack of it, included customer deposits and user assets.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>On at least one occasion during the Relevant Period, Alameda had reached a previously-set borrowing limit for its FTX account. In response, Bankman-Fried directed FTX personnel to raise the borrowing limit to a level that would be unlikely to ever be exceeded. On information and belief, FTX personnel ultimately raised Alameda’s borrowing limit to be many tens of billions of dollars. Alameda’s borrowed funds could also be withdrawn from FTX. These features, in combination, allowed Alameda unlimited ability to borrow and withdraw digital assets directly from FTX Trading to put towards its off-platform activities.</p></blockquote>



<p>Despite using customer funds to backstop billions in Alameda’s losses, the CFTC alleges that SBF’s trading giant was unable to repay loans and meet margin calls by May/June 2022. Notably, Terra’s $40 billion implosion happened around the same time. </p>



<p>The filing <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-new-ftt-tokens/">spurred</a> discourse around claims that Bankman-Fried and FTX played a role in crashing Luna and Three Arrows Capital after Su Zhu and his 3AC co-founder Kyle Davies published a barrage of Twitter threads blaming SBF for their fortunes. </p>

<h2>Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether Are Commodities: CFTC</h2>



<p>Part of the CFTC’s complaint gave insight into the regulators&#8217; approach toward classifying some cryptocurrencies. “Certain digital assets are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT) and others are commodities”, said the CFTC. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="680" height="319" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC.png" alt="CFTC: Alameda Used FTX Customer Funds To Stave Off Insolvency In May/June 2022 9" class="wp-image-580143" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC.png 680w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC-300x141.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CFTC-269x126.png 269w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" title="CFTC: Alameda Used FTX Customer Funds To Stave Off Insolvency In May/June 2022 19"></figure>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-chief-gary-gensler-cftc-cryptos/">reportedly</a> backs classifying Bitcoin as a commodity. However, the SEC under Gensler <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-pos-security-gary-gensler/">suggested</a> that Ethereum, and by extension ETH, should fall under U.S. Securities laws&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clear crypto regulations in the U.S. remain elusive despite the CFTC’s argument and the SEC’s rhetoric. Crypto participants have long blamed a lack of regulatory guidance for crypto as the underlying factor behind some failures in the digital asset industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the FTX Congressional <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/" rel="noreferrer noopener">hearings</a>, bipartisan lawmakers suggested a myriad of regulatory paths total bans on crypto, inclusive regulatory policies, and completely isolating blockchain technology from America’s traditional financial ecosystem. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao pointed to FTX&#8217;s collapse as a reason for increased scrutiny of the digital asset industry.</li><li>Zhao&#8217;s internal meme to Binance staff said the crypto exchange &#8220;will survive any crypto winter”.</li><li>Outflows from Binance crossed $6.1 billion in assets while inflows exceeded $6.5 billion in the same 24 hours, Nansen data showed.</li></ul>



<p>According to Binance CEO Chanpgeng Zhao, crypto winter is far from over and bumpy days lay ahead for the digital asset industry following the collapse of FTX, a now-bankrupt crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao who is known as CZ by crypto participants and mainstream media shared his thoughts in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. CZ told colleagues and staff to expect amplified scrutiny on crypto companies. Zhao also expects that industry leaders like Binance will have tough questions to answer as the FTX debacle unfolds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on December 13, a few before he was scheduled to testify before Congress. United State prosecutors affirmed that SBF was indeed arrested ahead of a formal indictment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">charged</a> with eight counts including fraud on customers and investors, money laundering, and campaign finance violations. Bankman-Fried was arraigned before a judge and denied bail. His lawyers argued for a $250,000 bail bond.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Binance Prepared For ‘Stress Test’ Says CZ</h2>



<p>CZ’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/binance-ceo-zhao-warns-bumpy-road-ahead-in-message-to-his-staff?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">memo</a> echoed previous rhetoric that Binance boasts liquidity to match withdrawal demands. The crypto exchange “will survive any crypto winter”, said Zhao to staff. Indeed, massive outflows from Binance highlighted mounting skepticism for centralized crypto exchanges and their reserves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nansen data showed withdrawals of over $6.1 billion in Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets from Binance in 24 hours. Data also showed $6.5 billion in inflows within the same period. CZ remained adamant that Binance customer assets are held 1:1.</p>

<p>Zhao used “FUD” and “stress test” to describe the spotlight on Binance following FTX’s crash, where top executives like SBF stand accused of stealing customer funds to finance debts and expenditures at Alameda.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FUD brought &quot;stress test&quot;, which in turn helps to build the credibility for exchanges that passes the test. <br><br>If you want to hold your own coins, feel free to use <a href="https://twitter.com/TrustWallet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@TrustWallet</a>.

<ul><li>FTX CEO John Ray has testified before the U.S House Committee on Financial Services</li><li>John Ray criticized former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for his unacceptable business practices.&nbsp;</li><li>The new management has recovered over $1 billion of the lost funds.&nbsp;</li><li>Sam Bankman-Fried has blamed John Ray and his team for jeopardizing the funds of FTX US customers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>John Ray III, the current CEO of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWAnrigAO3I" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">testified</a>&nbsp;before the U.S House Committee on Financial Services earlier today. This much anticipated congressional hearing was originally meant to feature former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried as well, but given that he is currently under arrest in The Bahamas, Mr. Ray has given lawmakers and creditors some key insights into the controversial business activities that transpired at what was once the world’s second-largest crypto exchange.</p>



<h2><strong>Unacceptable management practices at FTX</strong></h2>



<p>According to John Ray, FTX had “unacceptable management practices” which ultimately led to its collapse. The current CEO revealed that there was literally no record keeping within the company whatsoever. The man who was brought in to clean up the controversial Enron scandal, testified that he had never seen such an utter lack of record keeping at a company.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The owners, business, and senior management had virtual control of all the accounts and could move money or assets as they desired, undetected by customers.” John Ray stated.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>As for the funds lost due to the poor management that went on with FTX and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-knew-more-about-alameda-research-than-let-on/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alameda Research</a>, Mr. Ray stated that the funds lost were in excess of $7 billion. He added that his team had successfully recovered more than $1 billion of those funds. John Ray has estimated that it will take several months to secure the bankrupt exchange’s assets. The lack of proper financial records will be a major hindrance in this process. “‘I don’t trust a single piece of paper at this organization,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried’s congressional testimony</strong></h2>



<p>The former CEO was also expected to testify before the congressional committee. The testimony was canceled following his arrest by Bahamian authorities last night. However, a transcript of his intended testimony was published by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/?sh=2f1ecc3c3c47" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>&nbsp;earlier today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to SBF’s testimony, “American customers were protected, at least until Mr. Ray’s team took over.” The document further reveals that FTX US had separate order books and funds from the parent company. Sam Bankman-Fried was confident that the customers of the American subsidiary could be made whole immediately since FTX US is still solvent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried on Tuesday.</li><li>The unseal indictment order detailed eight counts including fraud, conspiracy, and violation of U.S. Campaign Finance Laws.</li><li>Other authorities like the CFTC and SEC filed charges against Bankman-Fried following his arrest by Bahamian law enforcement. </li></ul>



<p>The United States of America charged FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried on eight counts including in the Southern District of New York. United States Attorney Damian Williams previously announced SBF’s arrest in the Bahamas ahead of formal criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An indictment document unsealed on Tuesday revealed eight charges against SBF built around the operations of crypto exchange FTX, and Alameda research.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Counts Against Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<ul><li>Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on Customers&nbsp;</li><li>Wire Fraud on Customers&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud on Lenders</li><li>Wire Fraud on Lenders</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Commodities Fraud</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering&nbsp;</li><li>Conspiracy to Defraud the United State of America and Violate the Campaign Finance Laws</li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23450344-unsealed-indictment-in-us-v-bankman-fried-22-cr-673-abrams-as-sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-heads-to-sdny-echoes-of-onecoin-and-un-bribery-cases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indictment</a> means that Federal prosecutors have evidence that Sam Bankman-Fried used deceived customers and investors alike. U.S. Attorneys filed that SBF used customer funds from the FTX exchange to finance Alameda’s trading position and loan obligations. This means that customer deposits and assets were exposed to substantial losses worth billions. </p>



<p>Bankman-Fried notably denied defrauding customers of their crypto assets during several public interviews. SBF also claimed that Alameda had limited access to assets deposited on the FTX exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>U.S. prosecutors filed that Bankman-Fried knowingly comingled funds between FTX deposits and Alameda.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>BANKMAN-FRIED agreed with others to defraud customers of FTX.com by misappropriating those customers’ deposits and using those deposits to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research, BANKHAN- FRIED&#8217;s proprietary crypto hedge fund, and to make investments.</p></blockquote>



<p>FTX CEO John Ray’s scathing testimony before House Committee on Financial Services <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankruptcy-documents-fraud/">echoed</a> concerns from users and authorities alike that FTX, under SBF’s leadership, funded Alameda with stolen FTX user deposits. SBF was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-testify-senate/">scheduled</a> to testify at the same hearing prior to his arrest.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Authorities Crackdown On Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Southern District of New York (SDNY) have both <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/">charged </a>Sam Bankman-Fried for the collapse of FTX. Another regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), announced a lawsuit against the former crypto billionaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SBF was arrested in the Bahamas on Tuesday. At press time, it’s unclear if or when extradition to American soil will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">USA Damian Williams: Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY.  We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.</p>&mdash; US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1602451395910803457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>SEC vs Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>According to the SECs <a href="https://t.co/w2kZOfN7He" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filing</a>, SBF deceived equity investors of FTX Trading Ltd while also defrauding retail customers as well. The commission noted that Bankman-Fried raised over $1.8 billion from around 90 U.S.-based investors between May 2019 and November 2022. </p>



<p>The SEC said SBF branded himself as a “responsible leader of the crypto community” while “orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud”.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform. But from the start, Bankman-Fried improperly diverted customer assets to his privately-held crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research LLC (“Alameda”), and then used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tuesday’s filing noted that Bankman-Fried continued funding Alameda with FTX customer deposits when his trading giant was unable to meet loan obligations after the crypto crash in May 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SECs filing argued that Alameda was bolstered with FTX customer assets in order to keep up appearances and maintain access to cash injections from investors and lenders. Also, the charges <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankruptcy-documents-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that company assets were used to fund personal loans to SBF and other top FTX executives.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>But Bankman-Fried did not stop there. Even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Through the summer of 2022, he directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for “loans” to himself and other FTX executives.</p></blockquote>



<p>SEC prosecutors further opined that Sam Bankman-Fried remained active in decision-making at Alameda despite appointing Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco as joint heads of the company. The allegations threw more doubt on claims from SBF that he had little knowledge of day-to-day operations at Alameda. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bankman-Fried remained the ultimate decision-maker at Alameda, even after Ellison and Trabucco became co-CEOs in or around October 2021. Bankman-Fried directed investment and operational decisions, frequently communicated with Alameda employees, and had full access to Alameda’s records and databases.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was the first to face charges following FTX’s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankrupt-sam-bankman-fried-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collapse</a> in November 2022. The fallen crypto tycoon was in custody and awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. at press time. </p>
