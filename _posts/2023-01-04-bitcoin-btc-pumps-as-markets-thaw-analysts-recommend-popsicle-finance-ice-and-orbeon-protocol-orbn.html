<p class="s7">With the crypto winter giving way to the few but sure signs of spring, Bitcoin is expected to lead the coming bull run. Optimistic analysts predict a price jump of 341% for the premier cryptocurrency by the end of 2023. While most analysts predict a 47% rise for the same period. However, Bitcoins pump will fall below those of Popsicle Finance (ICE) and ORBN, with analysts predicting a 6000% pump for ORBN during its presale. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Bitcoin (BTC)</p>
<p class="s7">Bitcoin(BTC) is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. It is also the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization at $319.37B. During the bull run that spanned late 2020 and the first quarter of 2022, the price of Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of $68,990.90. </p>
<p class="s7">However, the second quarter of 2022 was the beginning of a crypto winter that has lasted until the year's end. Currently, Bitcoin's price is around $16,600, and Bitcoin has continued to trade around this level. </p>
<p class="s7">Nevertheless, it is not all doom and gloom for bitcoin investors. According to analysts, the only way for Bitcoin in the coming year is up. These forecasts signal the end of the winter and herald the coming of a much-anticipated bull run.</p>

<p class="s10">Popsicle Finance (ICE)</p>
<p class="s7">Popsicle Finance(ICE) is a project that provides a platform for users to manage liquidity across various chains while ensuring they get the highest yields possible. Popsicle Finance believes that all chains should be interconnected.</p>

<p class="s7">In the past 30 days, Popsicle Finance has experienced a 185% bull run. The predominant sentiment for this coin is bullish. Popsicle Finance is expected to hit around $0.50 by the end of 2022 and increase by an additional 228.02% to $1.54 by the end of 2024.
