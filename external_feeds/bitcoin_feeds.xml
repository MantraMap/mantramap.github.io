The cryptocurrency continues to hover around a key support level, without either bulls or bears taking control. Ethereum was also marginally higher.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) returned to the green on Saturday, as traders of the cryptocurrency rejected a breakout of a key price level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $29,253.52 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday peak of $29,517.77 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move comes as the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap began to consolidate, following a recent move above $30,000.</p>

<p>Bitcoin surged earlier this week, as markets reacted to Moody&#x2019;s downgrading the credit rating of several U.S. banks.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s consolidation occurred just as the relative strength index (RSI) flatlined around a support point near 49.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at a reading of 48.70, with earlier gains in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> somewhat fading.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also marginally higher to start the weekend, snapping a three-day losing streak in the process.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD peaked at $1,855.07 so far during Saturday&#x2019;s session, following Friday&#x2019;s low at the $1,839.57 level.</p>
<p>This is the first time since Tuesday that ethereum has climbed higher, and comes as profit taking from this week&#x2019;s high seems to have ended.</p>

<p>In order for momentum to once again shift, ethereum will need to break out of a ceiling at 50.00 on the RSI.</p>
<p>Price strength is currently tracking at 47.45.</p>

While some providers have already applied patches, others are still vulnerable.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitforge Vulnerabilities Disclosed</h2>
<p>Fireblocks, a cryptocurrency assets security and consulting company, has publicly disclosed Bitforge is facing a set of wallet vulnerabilities potentially affecting millions of customers. While the Fireblocks team discovered these issues back in May, it just announced their existence in a <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/#small-leaks-billions-of-dollars-practical-cryptographic-exploits-that-undermine-leading-crypto-wallets-32268" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a> titled &#8220;Small Leaks, Billions Of Dollars: Practical Cryptographic Exploits That Undermine Leading Crypto Wallets&#8221; as part of the Blackhat 2023 conference.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities attack the Multi-Party Computation (MPC) algorithms of several vendors. The first vulnerability is related to GG18 and GG20, two protocols qualified by Fireblocks as &#8220;pioneering for the MPC wallet industry&#8221; and &#8220;widely adopted by companies in the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/gg18-and-gg20-paillier-key-vulnerability-technical-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploit</a> allows criminals to exfiltrate the private key and take control of the cryptocurrency in the attacked wallet. Fireblocks also presented a proof-of-concept for this attack.</p>
<p>Similarly, the second vulnerability deals with Lindell17, a signing protocol. Fireblocks states this exploit &#8220;originates from Lindell17 implementations deviating from the specification of the academic paper and ignoring or mishandling aborts in case of failed signatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/lindell17-abort-vulnerability-technical-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerability</a> was discovered in the Zengo wallet and later confirmed to work against Coinbase Wallet as a Service (WAAS), as in open-source protocol implementations. Zengo and Coinbase have already patched their wallets to deal with this exploit.</p>
<p>Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer at Coinbase, thanked Fireblocks for the timely disclosure, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/new-bitforge-cryptocurrency-wallet-flaws-lets-hackers-steal-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling</a> Bleeping Computer that &#8220;while Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Vulnerability Checker</h2>
<p>Due to the number of wallets potentially affected by this set of vulnerabilities, Fireblocks has built a utility to allow wallet providers and users to check if their wallets can be exploited using these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>At the time, only <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> and Zengo are listed as secure against the Lindell17 exploit. Fireblocks <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/BitForge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that not all wallet providers are shown because &#8220;it&#8217;s part of the DNA of the industry to work together to be stronger out of the public eye rather than calling companies out publicly and harming their credibility.&#8221;</p>

The leader suggested that the optimism which ensued after Tinubu’s government floated the naira has now given way to pessimism.</strong></p>
<h2>The Naira&#8217;s Woes</h2>
<p>The president of the Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Aminu Gwadabe, has reportedly asked the Nigerian government to consider banning the crypto giant Binance. Gwadabe insisted that the crypto exchange platform is partly to blame for Nigeria’s persistent currency woes which have now seen the naira fall to a record low versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The remarks by Gwadabe suggest that both the Bola Ahmed Tinubu government and some key players in Nigeria&#8217;s foreign exchange market are seeking to loosen the top crypto exchange’s stranglehold on the Nigerian market. To illustrate, sometime in early June it was widely<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-regulator-labels-binance-affiliates-local-operations-illegal/"> reported</a> that the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission had banned Binance Nigeria Limited, the crypto exchange’s supposed affiliate.</p>
<p>However, following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cz-says-binance-has-issued-a-cease-and-desist-notice-against-nigerian-scammer-entity/">revelations</a> that Binance Nigeria Limited had no relationship with Binance, the SEC was forced to issue another <a href="https://sec.gov.ng/warning-against-investing-with-binance/">prohibition order</a> which barred any entity using the name Binance from operating in the East African state. The regulator also warned residents against using the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p>Meanwhile, in remarks published by the People’s Gazette, Gwadabe highlighted Binance’s perceived dominance and how this poses a threat to the Nigerian economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you know about Binance, you will know that Binance trading is becoming the anchorage of both the investors and exporters window and the parallel market, which is unfortunate. So, we have to do something that can stop Binance. It’s a competition. We need to ban Binance and the only way to do so is if you have liquidity,&#8221; explained Gwadabe.</p>
<p>The ABCON president added that the optimism which ensued after Tinubu’s government floated the naira, has now given way to pessimism.</p>

Over a dozen Russian banks are going to take part in the trials with real transactions and users scheduled to commence in mid-August.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia Prepares to Pilot Operations With New Digital Ruble</h2>
<p>Financial authorities and institutions in the Russian Federation are gearing up to start testing the country’s central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) in actual <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-launch-digital-ruble-transactions-with-real-users-in-august/">transactions between real users</a>. The trials are set to begin on Aug. 15.</p>
<p>Around 600 people and 30 companies will participate in the initial stage of the pilot, First Deputy Chair of the Central Bank of Russia, Olga Skorobogatova, unveiled at a press conference, quoted by the crypto news outlet Bits.media.</p>
<p>After verifying all operations conducted by the first group, the number of participants will be increased, she added. The tests will be carried out in 11 Russian cities, including Moscow where digital ruble transactions will be launched in the public transportation system.</p>
<p>The capital city’s subway has been a testing site for innovations, noted Maxim Liksutov, deputy mayor for transport. Local authorities plan to launch ticket sales for digital rubles in the Moscow metro and eventually introduce CBDC payments in other types of urban transportation, he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Skorobogatova revealed that 13 Russian banks will join the digital ruble pilot. During the briefing, First Deputy Chairman of the Board of Sovcombank, Sergey Khotimsky, said that commercial banks are also going to compete with the digital ruble platform, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will try to do the same as it was in the case of cash, when banks created services and introduced mechanisms to make non-cash money more profitable and interesting. And we will continue to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Khotimsky emphasized that Russian banking institutions would like the bank account to remain Russians’ main account. Officials have previously made it clear that the digital ruble, as the third form of Russian fiat, is meant to complement, not replace, paper cash or electronic bank money.</p>
<p>Legislation regulating the introduction of Russia’s central bank digital currency was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-passes-digital-ruble-law/">adopted</a> by both houses of parliament in July. Also last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-signs-digital-ruble-law-allowing-cbdc-payments-in-russia/">signed</a> the digital ruble bill into law opening the way for CBDC payments in the country.</p>

In a recent article, Brooks and Calomiris call for regulations to allow stablecoin issuers to have the clarity needed for the assets to thrive.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoins Might Help the U.S. Dollar Maintain Its Reserve Currency Status</h2>
<p>Brian Brooks, former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, and Charles Calomiris, former chief economist of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/stablecoins-can-help-keep-the-dollar-the-worlds-reserve-currency-yuan-china-ef1047c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> an op-ed article explaining how stablecoins could contribute to maintaining the status of the dollar as a reserve currency.</p>
<p>Brooks and Calomiris detail that stablecoins can be significant tools in the fight against worldwide de-dollarization, serving as catalysts for the demand for dollars for citizens in developing countries, even when their governments do not support dollarization per se.</p>
<p>They cite Argentina and Venezuela as examples of countries facing extremely high inflation levels with governments taking measures to cut dollar dependency, but whose citizens use dollars to protect their incomes and savings from losing value while stored in their national currencies.</p>
<p>In this sense, they explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faced with the dismal prospect of saving their wages in local currency stored in local bank accounts, more citizens of high-inflation countries are opting to use dollar-backed stablecoins as a synthetic savings account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, referring to the recent decline in the usage of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, Brooks and Calomiris explain the problems that a de-dollarized world might bring the U.S., stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A de-dollarized world would damage the U.S. The dollar’s reserve status reduces U.S. borrowing costs, which is crucial in an era when government borrowing and spending are at a record high and still climbing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Regulation Seen as Necessary</h2>
<p>Brooks and Calomiris raise a timely issue: regulation is necessary for these instruments to thrive and grow. They refer to the bill backed by Rep. Patrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, as a significant part of the puzzle to bring stablecoins to the mainstream level.</p>
<p>They stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is why Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry’s bill to regulate stablecoins is vital. It would establish federal and state oversight for stablecoin issuers, impose qualifications for reserve assets, and implement rules on redemptions and public disclosure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-house-financial-services-committee-passes-stablecoin-legislation-after-a-few-fireworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> the Clarity for Stablecoins Act with bipartisan support.

The business intelligence firm now holds 152,800 bitcoins, acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion, and it has plans to buy even more.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Microstrategy&#x2019;s Stock Outperforms Bitcoin, S&P500, Nasdaq, Gold, Silver</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The stock of business intelligence firm Microstrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) has risen 206% since the company adopted its bitcoin strategy, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor stated on Twitter Friday. He tweeted:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Three years ago today Microstrategy announced that it had adopted bitcoin as its Primary Treasury Reserve Asset, purchasing 21,454 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for $250 million, or ~$11,653 per bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Microstrategy adopted its bitcoin strategy on Aug. 10, 2020. In comparison, during the same time period, bitcoin has experienced a 145% increase, while the S&P 500 has risen 33% and the Nasdaq 25%, according to a chart Saylor shared on Twitter. Meanwhile, gold has seen a decline of 5%, and silver has decreased 19%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Blackrock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, is a major shareholder of Microstrategy. In February, Blackrock disclosed that it owns 760,000 shares of Microstrategy Incorporated, which represents 8.1% of the company. The asset manager is also trying to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">launch</a> a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Earlier this month, Microstrategy disclosed that it now holds <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-increases-bitcoin-holdings-to-152800-btc-plans-to-buy-more-with-750-million-stock-sales/">152,800 bitcoins</a>, acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion, or $29,672 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The company is also planning to buy more <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> with stock sales of up to $750 million.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Saylor explained in August 2020 that his company&#x2019;s bitcoin strategy &#x201C;seeks to maximize long-term value&#x201D; for shareholders. He described the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency as &#x201C;a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash.&#x201D; The executive added: &#x201C;Since its inception over a decade ago, bitcoin has emerged as a significant addition to the global financial system, with characteristics that are useful to both individuals and institutions.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

Bittrex and Bittrex Global agreed to pay $24 million. The SEC&#x2019;s director of enforcement alleged that for years, Bittrex worked with token issuers to &#x201C;scrub&#x201D; their online statements &#x201C;to evade the federal securities laws.&#x201D;</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bittrex Settles With SEC</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-150">announced</a> Thursday that crypto trading platform Bittrex Inc., its co-founder and former CEO William Shihara, and Bittrex&#x2019;s foreign entity Bittrex Global GmbH have reached a settlement with the regulator. The SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-crypto-exchange-bittrex-with-operating-unregistered-exchange-broker-and-clearing-agency/">charged</a> Bittrex entities and Shihara in April.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Specifically, the SEC explained that Bittrex and Shihara &#x201C;agreed to settle charges that they operated an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.&#x201D; Meanwhile, Bittrex Global &#x201C;agreed to settle charges that it failed to register as a national securities exchange.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The securities watchdog stated that as part of the settlement, subject to court approval, the defendants consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the securities laws. Moreover, the SEC detailed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bittrex and Bittrex Global agreed to pay, on a joint and several basis, disgorgement of $14.4 million, prejudgment interest of $4 million, and a civil penalty of $5.6 million, for a total monetary payment of $24 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&#x2019;s Division of Enforcement, commented: &#x201C;For years, Bittrex worked with token issuers to &#x2018;scrub&#x2019; their online statements of any indicia that they were investment contracts &#x2014; all in an effort to evade the federal securities laws. They failed.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The SEC has taken several enforcement actions against major crypto firms this year, including <span style="font-weight: 200;"> </span>and Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN). The Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase, which attempted to have the charges against it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/">dismissed</a> last week, claimed that the SEC &#x201C;overstepped&#x201D; its statutory authority. The regulator reportedly asked Coinbase to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-sec-asked-coinbase-to-delist-all-crypto-assets-except-bitcoin-prior-to-filing-lawsuit/">delist</a> all crypto tokens except bitcoin in order to comply with securities laws. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who has been slammed for his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-call-on-sec-to-stop-regulatory-assault-on-crypto-following-xrp-ruling/">enforcement-centric approach</a> to regulating the crypto industry, believes that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a> except bitcoin are securities. He also said that crypto is a highly speculative field that is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-says-crypto-is-a-highly-speculative-field-rife-with-fraud/">rife with fraud</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The SEC has also revealed its plan to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">appeal</a> the Ripple decision made by District Judge Analisa Torres regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. The securities watchdog believes that some parts of the Ripple ruling are &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-says-xrp-ruling-in-ripple-case-wrongly-decided-signals-appeal/">wrongly decided</a>,&#x201D; according to Gensler.&#13;<br />

That’s valid in particular for cross-border trade and de-dollarization, said Mohamed El Yattioui, professor at the American University in the Emirates.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS Bloc to Benefit From Inducting New Members Like UAE and Saudi Arabia, Academic Says</h2>
<p>“The role of BRICS has been increasing during the last years and in the last decade,” Mohamed Badine El Yattioui, doctor of political science and assistant professor of international affairs and strategy in the College of Security and Global Studies at the American University in UAE, told Russia’s Tass news agency.</p>
<p>The academic emphasized that “for the United Arab Emirates, it’s important to become part of the BRICS group,” which currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. He believes that the expansion will allow the bloc to put pressure on the West to recognize changes in the system of international relations.</p>
<p>The admission of the UAE and other candidates will help BRICS to “push the Western countries towards accepting some modifications of the new world order, especially those regarding international trade, international political economy in general, currency and leaving the dollar,” El Yattioui elaborated.</p>
<p>The professor highlighted that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have strong economies and high gross domestic product (GDP) and are offering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a> many opportunities, especially regarding energy. “It is in the interest of BRICS to have them inside the group,” he remarked.</p>
<p>Enlargement was one of the topics discussed by the foreign ministers of BRICS member states in Cape Town, South Africa, in June. The meeting was also attended by diplomats from 12 other nations that have expressed intentions to join the group of the largest developing economies.</p>
<p>This year’s BRICS summit is scheduled to take place on Aug. 22–24 in Johannesburg. The hosting country’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">unveiled</a> that the organization’s leaders will talk about its expansion. A total of 23 nations have so far submitted formal applications for membership, she said.</p>

Last month, Custodia started serving external business customers in select U.S. states, offering U.S. dollar deposits and government money market fund services, with bitcoin custody pending launch. The launch comes after overcoming regulatory pressures and challenges with the Federal Reserve Board. </strong></p>
<h2>Custodia Bank Debuts Services</h2>
<p>Many crypto and narrow banking proponents have awaited the arrival of <a href="https://custodiabank.com/">Custodia Bank</a>, a financial institution that is tech-forward and customer-centric. “We&#8217;re grateful to our partners, who appreciate our approach of complying with banking laws and regulations; to Wyoming for its enabling laws; to our team and investors; and to the law-abiding digital asset industry,” <a href="https://twitter.com/custodiabank/status/1690012708513390592?s=20">said</a> CEO Caitlin Long. Custodia says the bank&#8217;s regional bank-style risk management program, along with its dedication to following regulations, sets it apart from competitors.</p>
<p>Services now available include U.S. dollar deposits and U.S. government money market fund services, tailored to U.S.-based business customers. This includes digital asset businesses, fintechs, banks, corporate treasurers, trusts, pension funds, and start-ups. The bank&#8217;s strategy is to eventually serve customers worldwide, providing enhanced regulatory clarity and minimized transactional risk with its unique reserve model.</p>
<p>Custodia operates under the first special purpose depository institution (SPDI) legal and regulatory framework in the United States. This approach allows the bank to offer a full suite of financial services for both U.S. dollars and digital assets. Demand deposit accounts are protected under a 100% reserve requirement, and the bank offers API solutions for programmable accounts, payments, settlement, and future custody products, Custodia’s website <a href="https://custodiabank.com/">discloses</a>.</p>
<p>Custodia Bank&#8217;s journey to this point has been marked by challenges. In December, they informed the U.S. Federal Reserve of their intention to complete a specific task list and followed through despite it no longer being required. Independent reviews, new partnerships, and the development of new services to meet market needs were all part of the process, Custodia detailed on Friday.</p>
<p>In January 2023, the Federal Reserve Board <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-bank-custodia-denied-membership-in-us-federal-reserve-system/">issued a denial</a> for Custodia&#8217;s application to become a member of the system, citing “significant safety and soundness risks” related to crypto assets and an insufficient risk management framework. The denial reflected <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-look-at-the-feds-recent-custodia-bank-denial-and-the-central-banks-push-back-against-narrow-banking/">broader regulatory skepticism</a> towards digital assets and narrow banking techniques. However, Custodia&#8217;s perseverance and alignment with Wyoming&#8217;s innovative legal framework for SPDIs have allowed them to navigate these challenges and emerge as a regulated bank.</p>
