<p>Over the previous 24 hours, Litecoin (LTC) had a 28% increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After several weeks of significant losses for cryptocurrencies, Tron falls behind LTC's price increase, falling behind 12.7% in the last week. Litecoin continues to lead the crypto market, leaving Tron and other cryptocurrencies behind. But there still might be hope for TRX.</p>
<p>Stop investing in dino-coins like Tron and Litecoin and research new coins such as The Hideaways (HDWY).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is There A Chance For Tron Revival?</p>
<p>With a market value of almost $4.7 billion, Tron (TRX) was trading at $0.051675 and had experienced a negative 4.5% increase over the previous day. The oversold reading on TRX's RSI appeared bullish. This gave TRX a good impression since it suggested that the trend would soon reverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, during the past week, TRON's development activity has seen positive progress, which is a good indicator of the coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remaining metrics, however, were against a price increase. Over the past week, TRON's NFT ecosystem has seen a downturn as its overall NFT trade count and trading volume in USD decreased after peaking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As bears surround TRX, it might struggle to reach a price reversal in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Litecoin Shoots Up 28.9%</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) is the 13th largest cryptocurrency in market capitalization. Users are starting to think of LTC as a store of value as the coin's trading volume has increased by 123.12% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>LTC Foundation stated last week that over 60 million Litecoins had been kept in deep freeze for over a year, guaranteeing bullish signs to investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reach the $5 billion market cap, Litecoin will decrease its fresh issuance of LTC from 12.5 to 6.25 for every transaction. Veterans are claiming LTC as the next Bitcoin due to the coin being a low-risk investment.&nbsp;</p>
