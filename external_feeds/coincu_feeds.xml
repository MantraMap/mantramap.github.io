<p>On Tuesday, crypto data firm Kaiko published research showing Binance.US currently accounts for only 1.5% of the total weekly trading volume of U.S. crypto exchanges, down from 8.2% at the beginning of this year and a peak of 22% at the end of March.</p>

<p>Binance.US is currently facing a number of challenges, with its banks and payment partners cutting off support, its liquidity drying up, and customers consistently withdrawing money from the platform.</p>



<p>Coinbase Global, also sued by the SEC, has also seen its market share drop from 56.5% at the start of the year to 51% at the end of June.</p>

<p>Both companies have found themselves directly in the crosshairs of the SEC, having been named in high-profile cases only a few weeks ago. The SEC&#8217;s action against Binance, on the other hand, names its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, as well as BAM Trading, the operating firm of Binance.US, which is an affiliate of the worldwide exchange.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/196704-coinbase-facilitated-to-challenge-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> has lambasted the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to respond to issues posed in the United States Court of Appeals as part of its continuing legal dispute with the agency. The business said that the SEC&#8217;s silence, protracted delays, and enforcement actions continue to weigh on the crypto sector and that SEC head Gary Gensler is well on his way to irrevocably harming a US public company and an entire industry.</p>

<p>On the other hand, exchanges such as LMAX, Bitstamp, and Kraken are gaining market share in the US.</p>



<p>Binance, the global platform, has also lost more than half of its market share in euro-denominated crypto deals this year. Binance said last week that it is leaving the Netherlands after failing to register with the country&#8217;s banking regulators. Meanwhile, French officials paid an on-site visit to the business, which is being investigated for suspected unlawful supply of digital-asset services and aggravated money laundering.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The recent lawsuits by the SEC against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase have had a big impact on the industry.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The recent lawsuits by the SEC against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase have had a big impact on the industry. The SEC is one of the most powerful regulators in the world, and their actions against two major players in crypto caused a big drop in the market. A week later, the market still hasn&#8217;t recovered.</strong></h5>



<p>The lawsuits against <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196317-binance-is-under-siege-in-europe/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/196317-binance-is-under-siege-in-europe/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance </a>and Coinbase are a major turning point for the cryptocurrency market. Almost all assets have fallen, and users have withdrawn their funds from major exchanges.</p>



<p>The SEC accuses these &#8220;mastodons&#8221; of trading in unregistered securities. This is the first time the US regulator has been so hostile to such big players in the crypto world. The lawsuits will have far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency market, especially for projects whose tokens are now classified as securities by the SEC.</p>



<p>The SEC has named several dozen tokens as securities in these court cases, which has caused mixed reactions from the community.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hdkRtXB3z3TTcMu822gzQgzZnK2D9NqOQmA4guf6hPUekw3aQqLsreXJ6GoL5SZaQwqNIq6N7GTcwvIBWam5rNvYZDjVjxhXRSM9SW8f09NIyNzHaihPtvBjQRsxqu2Qn3Pp3Nn8WnLrurfRhjdK0X4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hdkRtXB3z3TTcMu822gzQgzZnK2D9NqOQmA4guf6hPUekw3aQqLsreXJ6GoL5SZaQwqNIq6N7GTcwvIBWam5rNvYZDjVjxhXRSM9SW8f09NIyNzHaihPtvBjQRsxqu2Qn3Pp3Nn8WnLrurfRhjdK0X4" alt="SEC&#039;s Crypto Securities List Consequences" title="SEC&#039;s Crypto Securities List Consequences 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The SEC uses the Howey test to analyze assets against the term &#8220;security,&#8221; which consists of three points:</p>



<ul>
<li>An investment of money</li>



<li>In a common enterprise</li>



<li>Reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others</li>
</ul>



<p>Most of these coins are PoS tokens, with Dash being the only Proof of Work coin. The SEC&#8217;s stance is clearly against staking tokens and staking providers registered in the US, as stakers receive profits from others&#8217; transaction fees. This falls under point 3 of the Howey test and is similar to dividend mechanics.</p>



<p>Many of the coins on the list are old coins that were added to the list after lawsuits related to crashes, scams, or ICO pyramid schemes. It also includes 13 mirrored assets, tokenized shares using Mirror Protocol.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:26px"><strong>Consequences for the Crypto World</strong></h2>



<p>The addition of many high-profile projects to the crypto securities list has damaged their reputation. Being on this list is not good news for projects that are still alive, as many unexpected actions could follow. Many of these tokens are underperforming the market, and there is a significant drop in their value. CryptoRank has created a <a href="https://cryptorank.io/watchlist/747c0b6bd3ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watchlist</a> to track their performance.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lnopL-S_BAjZyiZHlKtn5ZpRSwtlGDIlKXy87gK1XrDlzPd4blw2jryA0agrcg1UtNA0TCN7MPrZ9hd0f1Igak0SWC4Jqx3JrUZTZiHuE_R2fUahSWwboBCfY89s6DLmkFYxOi3npuCcbW5bjL-Jmd8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lnopL-S_BAjZyiZHlKtn5ZpRSwtlGDIlKXy87gK1XrDlzPd4blw2jryA0agrcg1UtNA0TCN7MPrZ9hd0f1Igak0SWC4Jqx3JrUZTZiHuE_R2fUahSWwboBCfY89s6DLmkFYxOi3npuCcbW5bjL-Jmd8" alt="SEC&#039;s Crypto Securities List Consequences" title="SEC&#039;s Crypto Securities List Consequences 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:26px"><strong>How can you make the most of the watchlist?</strong></h2>



<p>It is always good to stay informed. But it is even better to know how to apply this information. If you trade in a US jurisdiction, be wary of these coins. Their appearance on the SEC’s list is a big red flag. But if you don&#8217;t believe in SEC’s threats and want to cash in on this Black Swan moment, there are several tokens on this list that have lost significantly in price but remain strong and independent projects (MATIC, SOL, ATOM, etc.).</p>



<p>* * *</p>



<p>Many well-known projects now face the need to adapt to a new environment where their token is considered a security. This has triggered a fall in the price of these assets, but the worst is yet to come. Reputational costs, delisting from major exchanges, and investors&#8217; fear of buying tokens can all affect projects&#8217; long-term development plans.</p>



<p>Many US-based crypto exchanges have already begun delisting those coins and tokens. Retail investment providers, such as eToro and Robinhood, have also delisted them. This will lead to a massive outflow of American investors&#8217; funds.</p>



<p>While the SEC&#8217;s power is only possible in the US, many foreign regulators and international institutions are eager to adopt the SEC&#8217;s expertise. We should not be surprised if similar lawsuits or crypto-securities lists arise in other countries.</p>



<p>The total capitalization of all coins called securities is about $100B, which is around 10% of the market. This could have a negative impact on the performance of the entire market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:26px"><strong>What Can We Do Now?</strong></h2>



<p>As long as the SEC&#8217;s stance on digital currencies remains negative, it is difficult to predict what the regulator will do next. However, the regulator is unlikely to soften its stance dramatically in the near future.</p>



<p>The legal battle may drag on for months, and the outcome is not clear at all. What we can say for now is that the &#8220;free development&#8221; period of the cryptocurrency sector is coming to an end, and now all projects will have to adapt to the new conditions, changing their usual development models.</p>



<p>It is worth being wary of coins on this list, especially for US residents and users of US crypto exchanges. Take care of the safety of your assets, but be sure to do your own research.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Azuki, the leading NFT project, warned users to be aware of phishing links and frauds posing as the project.</em></li>



<li><em>The team also indicated that it had taken all necessary procedures to safeguard the account and would remain in contact with the FBI.</em></li>



<li><em>The FBI will continue to look into Azuki&#8217;s earlier Twitter account theft.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following the hack of the Twitter account of the popular NFT project Azuki, the team <a href="https://twitter.com/Azuki/status/1671268950280372226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warned</a> users before the Las Vegas event.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The NFT project reminded users to be wary of phishing links and scams pretending to be the project.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Due to the highly anticipated Azuki event in Las Vegas, Twitter and team accounts will be a target for hackers. Phishing links and scams disguised as Azuki will be on the rise. Your security is top priority for us. Here are some tips to stay safe.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team also stated that it had taken all necessary precautions to protect the account and will continue to be in touch with the FBI. The FBI will continue to actively investigate Azuki&#8217;s previous social account theft.</p>



<p>Azuki has attracted the attention of NFT collectors around the world and has quickly become one of the most valuable collectibles on the market. Early this year, the leading NFT project&#8217;s Twitter account was <a href="https://news.coincu.com/163024-azukis-social-account-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked</a>, resulting in the loss of crypto assets. After a takeover of the project&#8217;s account, the stolen funds were moved to a cryptocurrency mixing platform.</p>

<p>Hackers have taken advantage of Azuki&#8217;s Twitter following to spread information about dangerous phishing websites. They established bogus links to The Garden, the project&#8217;s metaverse gateway, enabling users to stake their claim to the land.</p>

<p>According to PeckShield, hackers in the assault on the NFT project&#8217;s main social media account traded the stolen cash for a total of 618 ETH (one 468 ETH, the other 150 ETH) and moved it to crypto mixer Tornado Cash. At the same time, the phishing address stole 196 NFTs, including 74 Otherdeeds, 56 Beanz, 12 Doodles, 2 MAYCs, and 41 PudgyPenguins. So far, the address has been sent to 234 ETH.</p>

<li><em>The Monetary Authority of Singapore has proposed a common protocol for the use of cryptocurrencies on a distributed ledger.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol allows for specified conditions when transferring digital money across different systems.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has released a <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/pbm/pbm-technical-whitepaper.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/pbm/pbm-technical-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whitepaper </a>proposing a common protocol for the use of cryptocurrencies, such as tokenized bank deposits, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), on a distributed ledger. </strong></h5>

<p>The protocol allows senders to specify conditions when transferring digital money across different systems, such as validity periods and types of shops. The whitepaper was developed in collaboration with international monetary organizations, financial institutions, and FinTech firms and covers technical specifications for the protocol&#8217;s lifecycle and business and operating models.</p>



<p>The whitepaper was supported by the release of software prototypes demonstrating the concept of Purpose Bound Money (PBM), which enables the transfer of digital money under specified conditions across different systems. The PBM protocol is designed to work with different ledger technologies and forms of money and allows users to access digital money using their preferred wallet provider. Financial institutions and FinTech firms are launching trials to test the usage of PBM under different scenarios, including online commerce and programmable rewards.</p>

<p>The PBM whitepaper builds on MAS’ Project Orchid and aims to encourage greater research among central banks, FIs, and FinTechs to understand the design considerations in the use of digital money. PBM source codes and software prototypes developed under Project Orchid were released for public access to support ongoing development and learning. The open-source codes and prototypes demonstrate how PBM can be used to embed digital money in escrow arrangements, serving as a reference model to foster interoperability across different platforms.</p>



<p>MAS’ Chief FinTech Officer, Mr. Sopnendu Mohanty, said that this collaboration has helped achieve advances in settlement efficiency, merchant acquisition, and user experience with the use of digital money. The whitepaper represents an important step toward digital money becoming a key component of the future financial and payment landscape.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>According to Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, the Third Circuit has now declared that it would maintain jurisdiction over its appeal to the SEC&#8217;s inactivity.</em></li>



<li><em>The next report will be due in 120 days.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinbase has previously suggested that the SEC should be forced to reply to its petition by the court.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal announced that the Third Circuit has just ruled that it will retain jurisdiction over Coinbase&#8217;s challenge to the inaction of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</strong></h5>

<p>The following report will be due in 120 days. The exchange has previously suggested that the SEC should be forced to reply to its petition by the court.</p>

<p>While the SEC&#8217;s action against Coinbase is still in its early stages, the future steps remain unclear. As of Tuesday, the exchange had not delisted any of the tokens described as securities by the SEC in action and had made no public statements regarding a possible settlement.</p>



<p>The exchange has chastised the SEC for avoiding the enforcement of its crypto regulation as part of a legal dispute between the two. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase on June 6, saying that the exchange violates multiple US securities laws, including operating as an unregistered exchange.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1552.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="961" height="746" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1552.png" alt="Coinbase Facilitated To Challenge The SEC" class="wp-image-196734" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1552.png 961w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1552-300x233.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1552-768x596.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1552-750x582.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px" title="Coinbase Facilitated To Challenge The SEC 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The SEC notified the court on June 13 that it had yet to decide on the course of action in the litigation and that there would be no particular date for a response to Coinbase&#8217;s request. The exchange criticized the SEC&#8217;s approach, claiming that the SEC has yet to deliberate on its rule-making procedures.</p>



<p>Coinbase filed a lawsuit in federal court in the United States on April 25, requesting the SEC to react to a petition it filed in July 2022 to adopt clear standards for digital assets. It wanted the SEC to offer regulatory advice to the crypto company by July 2022, prompting the exchange to sue the government in April when the agency failed to reply.</p>

<p>A letter from Coinbase&#8217;s defense team most recently reiterated earlier comments that the SEC has failed to give regulatory clarity while seeking compliance with nonexistent regulations.</p>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>EDX Markets, a new &#8220;noncustodial&#8221; exchange backed by Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments, and Charles Schwab, has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-backed-by-citadel-securities-fidelity-schwab-starts-operations-597f6d46" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-backed-by-citadel-securities-fidelity-schwab-starts-operations-597f6d46" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a>.

<p>The exchange will offer trading in just four cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin cash, none of which have been identified as securities by the SEC. Such a conservative approach to listing cryptocurrencies could help EDX stay out of trouble with the SEC, which has sued Coinbase Global and other crypto exchanges for listing coins that the agency deems to be securities. Coinbase has disputed the agency’s categorization of cryptocurrencies as securities and vowed to fight back in court.</p>



<p>EDX is a &#8220;noncustodial&#8221; exchange, meaning it doesn&#8217;t directly handle digital assets. Instead, EDX runs a marketplace where firms agree to execute trades of coins and dollars, using its platform to agree on prices. Then the firms move crypto and cash between each other to settle the trades. </p>

<p>The launch of EDX Markets shows that some Wall Street firms remain interested in crypto despite a regulatory onslaught by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a market that has cooled off substantially over the past 18 months. Citadel Securities, an electronic market-making firm with a huge presence in stocks and options, confirmed it was trading cryptocurrencies on EDX. Citadel Securities’ billionaire founder Ken Griffin was earlier a very public critic of crypto.</p>



<p>EDX&#8217;s backers include electronic trading firms Virtu Financial, Sequoia Capital, and Paradigm. In addition, EDX has attracted investment from options-exchange operator Miami International Holdings and affiliates of proprietary trading firms DV Trading, GTS, GSR, and Hudson River Trading. Both Citadel Securities and GTS are market-makers on the NYSE, and Citadel’s founder, Ken Griffin, made his fortune in traditional markets and was publicly hostile to crypto as recently as a year and a half ago.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[According to Protos, TrueUSD halted automated attestations due to automated balance-related issues amid Prime Trust problems.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Due to balance issues, TrueUSD automated attestations are currently on hold.</em></li>



<li><em>The &#8216;ripcord&#8217; feature notifies users if an issue could affect the ability to generate certificates.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, TUSD had to suspend Prime Trust-related redemptions and minting transactions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Protos, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194631-trueusd-resume-mining-tusd-on-prime-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueUSD </a>halted automated attestations due to automated balance-related issues amid Prime Trust problems.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1542.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="579" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1542.png" alt="TrueUSD Automated Attestations Paused Due To Auto Balance Error" class="wp-image-196712" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1542.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1542-300x170.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1542-768x434.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1542-750x424.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="TrueUSD Automated Attestations Paused Due To Auto Balance Error 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The System powered by Archblock for TrueUSD includes a &#8220;ripcord&#8221; feature that notifies users if issues could affect the ability to generate proofs. Currently, an active balance ripcord, which according to Archblocks means: &#8220;During the last reporting period, LedgerLens&#8217; real-time reserve system received an error response resulting in greater total liability total underlying assets.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the System, A ripcord is a pre-condition or requirement for a new attestation report to be generated by the LedgerLens Real Time Reserves system. In order for the System to develop a new attestation report at the &#8220;standard reporting interval,&#8221; no ripcords must be present or &#8220;triggered.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1544.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="753" height="915" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1544.png" alt="TrueUSD Automated Attestations Paused Due To Auto Balance Error" class="wp-image-196714" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1544.png 753w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1544-247x300.png 247w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1544-750x911.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" title="TrueUSD Automated Attestations Paused Due To Auto Balance Error 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">TrueUSD ripcord. Source: Archblock</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Usually, during the historical operation of the System, balance imbalances are triggered by temporary imbalances in normal operation, but balance imbalances can also be triggered by real imbalances of liabilities and assets, respectively.</p>



<p>This situation begins with a management requirement of the certification provider. In any case, the ripcord balance will expire after 72 hours. If there is still an imbalance after 72 hours and no other ripcord has been activated, the System will generate a new proof report showing the balance at the time the System obtained it.</p>



<p>Prior to that, TrueUSD had to halt acquisitions and minting related to Prime Trust, while Prime Trust is said to have agreed in principle to BitGo&#8217;s acquisition. TrueUSD has announced that other redemptions and minting avenues remain.</p>



<p>TrueUSD has played an increasingly important role in the crypto ecosystem, doubling its market capitalization since the start of the year. This is partly thanks to the increased use of Binance after the New York Department of Financial Services shut down Binance USD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin and GBTC have both experienced significant gains, with GBTC surging by 11.44% and reaching a trading volume of $10.24 million, the highest since November 22 last year.</em></li>



<li><em>Grayscale Bitcoin premium has rallied more than 25% since BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF like GBTC application.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin and GBTC surged, ETF applications filed, and SEC identified altcoins as securities. The crypto market recovered with significant gains in Bitcoin and GBTC. Bitcoin and Ether had significant gains at the start of the trading day, with Bitcoin&#8217;s market value reaching 51%.</strong></h5>



<p>GBTC surged by 11.44%, reaching a trading volume of $10.24 million, the highest since November 22 last year. This is due to GBTC rising by more than 25% since BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF like GBTC application. <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/fund-data/fund-market-premium?symbol=gbtc&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/fund-data/fund-market-premium?symbol=gbtc&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoQuant </a>shows that the current Grayscale Bitcoin premium is -34.19%, the second highest point this year.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has also risen sharply, with gains of 6.9% in the past 24 hours and 10.6% in the last seven days. <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/7W3S722o/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/7W3S722o/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tradingview </a>shows that Bitcoin&#8217;s market value has reached 51%. This is a significant increase and a positive sign for the market.</p>



<p>In addition, four large ETF institutions, including iShares Bitwise WisdomTree Invesco, have recently applied for a Bitcoin ETF. This has the potential to attract more money into Bitcoin. Furthermore, the U.S. SEC has identified a large number of altcoins as securities, which could also result in more money flowing back into Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Bitcoin and Ether started the trading day with significant gains. Bitcoin reached $29k before trading at around $28,762, while Ether is up 3.4% and is trading at $1,793. This is great news for crypto investors and indicates that the market is beginning to recover.</p>

<p>According to <em>Bitcoin Magazine</em>, US investment firm Invesco, which manages approximately $1.49 trillion in assets, has resumed its own Bitcoin spot ETF application process.</p>

<p>Invesco submitted an application for approval to launch Bitcoin spot-based ETF of Galaxy Digital, a cryptocurrency financial service and investment management company, to the SEC in 2021 but improved the plan around October of the same year.</p>



<p>The SEC has recently taken drastic crackdowns on the crypto industry, causing the market to struggle for two weeks in a row.</p>



<p>Invesco&#8217;s Bitcoin spot ETF re-registration comes with WisdomTree, an $87 billion fund manager. Both these companies, on the same day, submitted decisions that can be said to help improve the confidence of the crypto market in recent times.</p>

<p>Before <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196656-wisdomtree-enters-spot-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WisdomTree</a> and Invesco, the world&#8217;s biggest asset management firm, BlackRock, was the first to apply to the SEC for a license to trade a Bitcoin ETF on the NASDAQ platform.</p>



<p>While the SEC has not yet accepted BlackRock&#8217;s petition, many individuals are encouraged by the news. The company has previously applied for 576 ETFs but has only been refused once.</p>



<p>There is also talk that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196154-fidelity-follows-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a> would acquire Grayscale or launch a Bitcoin ETF to compete with <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195689-bitcoin-is-exciting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>. Nevertheless, the SEC has yet to approve any Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States.</p>

<p>Many have long anticipated the Bitcoin ETF to provide fresh growth drivers for the industry, as it highlights the potential of the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency in conventional finance. The financial management behemoths are bringing Bitcoin closer to millions of individual and institutional investors with this offering.</p>



<p>At the same time, several other financial titans announced excellent news, including the establishment of the EDX Markets crypto exchange by three Wall Street titans: Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel.</p>

<p>All funds and NFTs are safe. No action is needed at this time. The project is suspended and cannot initiate new loans. The suspended state is to protect all assets in the protocol. They confirm that no funds are lost. The project also said that it has successfully executed a white hat recovery script, saving all ERC20 and ERC721 assets of all LPs and borrowers. All information will be updated for users as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Astaria has been in public beta since May 25. The recovery script uses an updated contract implementation and the Recovery Token, which has withdrawn all funds and NFTs to Astaria&#8217;s multi-signature address.</p>



<p>Non-fungible token lending platform Astaria has gone public after a lengthy closed beta period. The platform was co-founded by former decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol SushiSwap CTO Joseph Delong. NFT holders can lease their assets to traders who cannot afford blue-chip NFTs in one purchase. With support for over 300,000 NFTs, Astaria seeks to inject liquidity into the larger Ethereum-based NFT ecosystem.</p>

<p>Unlike other NFT lending platforms that work peer-to-peer with borrowers and lenders, Astaria uses a third party to facilitate its lending market, tapping into its NFT due diligence service. The upshot to acting as a &#8220;strategist&#8221; will help liquidity providers enter the market while assisting borrowers in leasing their properties.</p>
