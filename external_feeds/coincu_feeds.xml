<p>In the past 24 hours, there has been a record-high number of transactions on the Sui blockchain, exceeding 29 million transaction blocks. This surge was primarily driven by the launch of the first on-chain game on Sui called Sui 8192, which is similar in gameplay to the classic puzzle game 2048. </p>



<p>The game is a sliding tile game where players use their arrow keys to shift and combine tiles until they reach a tile worth 8192. Despite its simplicity, Sui 8192 has the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry. On-chain games are becoming increasingly popular as they are ubiquitous and can be played from any device connected to the internet. Additionally, the game is persistent and becomes part of the player&#8217;s digital assets, opening up new possibilities for trading and gifting. This capability sets an example for other apps, such as collaborative productivity tools.</p>

<p>Sui 8192 is a dynamic NFT, exhibiting the unique properties of NFTs on Sui in that it can change its appearance based on user inputs. It demonstrates many interesting new use cases for NFTs, such as using an NFT for an app&#8217;s interface. Ethos was programmed as the first wholly on-chain Sui game. Each newly minted Sui 8192 object contains the game logic, while the interface was coded in javascript, CSS, and HTML.</p>



<p>Sui is a layer-1 blockchain launched in May 2023 and was touted at the time as a &#8220;Solana killer.&#8221; SUI prices were down 0.5% on the day at $0.678 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Binance has announced the release of a new token called Arkham (ARKM) on its Launchpad, which will go on sale for 24 hours starting from July 17, 2023, 06:00 (UTC) to July 18, 2023, 06:00 (UTC). Users can check their eligibility and commit their BNB to the token sale based on their past six-day average BNB holdings. </p>



<p>The BNB rate for the ARKM token sale has been set at 0.00020576 BNB or 0.05 USD (using a BNB price of 243 USD). After the subscription period ends, Binance will list Arkham (ARKM) in the innovation zone and open trading for ARKM/BTC, ARKM/USDT, ARKM/TUSD, ARKM/BNB, and ARKM/TRY trading pairs on July 18, 2023, 12:00 (UTC).</p>



<p>To protect users from high volatility when trading commences under Launchpad, Binance will trial an initial price limit mechanism where, for the first five minutes of trading, the maximum transaction price is set at ten times the public sale token price (i.e., in the case of ARKM, $0.50, ten times the public sale token price). After the initial five minutes, there will be no restrictions, and trading will continue normally. Note that this initial price limit mechanism is being trialed for the ARKM token launch, and it is yet to be determined if this will be an ongoing feature of all future Launchpads.</p>



<p>Users will have 24 hours to subscribe by committing their BNB tokens between July 17, 2023, 06:00 (UTC) and July 18, 2023, 06:00 (UTC). Users can subscribe to BNB at any time during these 24 hours. Users must also sign the ARKM Token Purchase Agreement before committing to their BNB. The hard cap for ARKM token allocation per user is 15,000 USD (300,000 ARKM or 61.728 BNB), and the maximum amount of BNB that each user can commit has been calculated based on their past six-day average BNB balance.</p>



<p>Once committed, users&#8217; BNB will be locked, and they cannot redeem or access any other functions, such as transfers, withdrawals, or trading, until final token distribution. After the subscription period ends on July 18, 2023, at 06:00 (UTC), the ARKM token allocation calculation will begin and will take one hour. </p>



<p>The final ARKM token allocation results will be revealed on July 18, 2023, 07:00 (UTC), at this point, the respective BNB will be deducted from users&#8217; already-locked BNB amount within 60 minutes. Once deducted, users&#8217; ARKM and remaining BNB tokens will both be transferred to their spot wallet.</p>

OKX CEO Questions Its Function 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>UniSat Wallet recently announced the launch of brc20-swap, which they claim to be the first-ever Ordinals native swap that runs on the Bitcoin mainnet and utilizes the brc20 protocol. However, <a href="https://coincu.com/201712-okx-launches-brc20-s-a-new-staking-mechanism/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/201712-okx-launches-brc20-s-a-new-staking-mechanism/" rel="noreferrer noopener">some </a>have questioned whether this function is a centralized swap, as the current Bitcoin network does not support smart contracts, making it difficult to achieve a fully decentralized DEX Swap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, we&#39;re proud to announce brc20-swap, <br><br>the first-ever Ordinals native swap, floating on top of bitcoin mainnet, utilizing brc20 protocol as its underlying asset infrastructure. <br><br>(1/12) <a href="https://t.co/PpEU9Js3OG" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/PpEU9Js3OG</a></p>&mdash; UniSat Wallet &#8211; Store, Inscribe and Search.

</div></figure>



<p>UniSat has been receiving proposals from various teams and individuals who are eager to extend the capabilities of brc20. They are enthusiastic about supporting these innovations and aim to make the UniSat brc20 indexer highly competitive in this space. Supporting these ideas aligns with their commitment to pushing the boundaries of brc20 itself and showcasing its full flexibility and extensibility.</p>



<p>brc20-swap is designed to be simple to understand and permissionless to join. Anyone should be able to deploy a new trading pair and then add liquidity to a given swap, just like deploying and minting a classic brc20. While there may be some complexities involved, it&#8217;s designed to be convenient for developers to deploy a service instance of brc20-swap independently. UniSat will provide source code, APIs, and docs to help users build swaps based on this one.</p>



<p>OKX CEO Star Xu questioned whether this function is a centralized swap. Since the current Bitcoin network does not support smart contracts, achieving a fully decentralized DEX Swap isn&#8217;t easy.</p>

</figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance has faced multiple challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Launchpool&#8217;s continuous release has caused a slight increase in the price of $BNB. The most recent release,<a href="https://coincu.com/201234-binance-launch-the-32nd-launchpad-arkham-arkm/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/201234-binance-launch-the-32nd-launchpad-arkham-arkm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Launchpad &#8211; Arkham</a>, was followed by a scandal involving <a href="https://coincu.com/203179-arkham-airdrop-issues-are-genuine-user/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/203179-arkham-airdrop-issues-are-genuine-user/" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked user emails </a>after Arkham announced the airdrop of ARKM tokens.</p>



<p>In other news related to Binance, the company <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" rel="noreferrer noopener">has laid off </a>more than 1000 employees. Additionally, Binance has suspended support for 8 bridging tokens with Multichain, causing the price of MULTI to drop. <a href="https://coincu.com/202911-multichain-ceo-disappears-with-user-assets/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/202911-multichain-ceo-disappears-with-user-assets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multichain has officially announced its shutdown</a>, along with news that the CEO was arrested. It is not yet clear why the CEO was arrested, but it is likely that users&#8217; money will be difficult to retrieve.</p>



<p>On a more positive note, a recent report revealed that Binance offers a platform for Indian traders to exchange cryptocurrencies for rupees, working similar to an escrow service. The cryptocurrency exchange holds the user&#8217;s digital assets until the buyer and seller agree on the transaction and the funds have been transferred. However, this strategy has attracted the attention of the <a href="https://coincu.com/201752-reserve-bank-of-india-13million-cbdc/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/201752-reserve-bank-of-india-13million-cbdc/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reserve Bank of India</a> (RBI). </p>



<p>Regulators are currently assessing whether local traders may be breaking foreign exchange and money laundering rules. Despite these regulatory concerns, Indian crypto enthusiasts appear to be flocking to Binance. Amid a stifling environment due to high taxes and fear of backlash from the RBI, local traders find Binance&#8217;s rupee transactions an attractive alternative.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Macroeconomic</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1081.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="781" height="926" data-id="203230" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1081.png" alt="Market Overview" class="wp-image-203230" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1081.png 781w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1081-253x300.png 253w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1081-768x911.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1081-750x889.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" title="Market Overview (July 10th to July 16th): Discover the Latest Crypto Market Buzz 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Macroeconomic &#8211; Market Overview</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The latest market overview reports indicate that both the CPI and PPI figures have exceeded expectations, suggesting that inflation may be cooling down. This is a positive signal for the economy and could potentially lead to announcements regarding interest rates on July 26th. </p>



<p>While it&#8217;s still too early to predict the exact outcome, this news is certainly encouraging for those who have been following the market overview closely. It&#8217;s worth noting that any changes to interest rates can have a significant impact on the overall economic landscape, which is why investors and analysts alike are keeping a close eye on these developments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Last week’s highlights big news</strong></h2>



<p>The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with news, and there are many interesting developments to keep an eye on market overview. For example, Elon Musk has founded an AI company called xAI, which is expected to benefit the AI segment. In addition, the SEC has begun reviewing Bitcoin ETF Spot applications by major players such as BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity, Wisdomtree, and Ivesco. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice has moved nearly $302.2 million worth of Bitcoin to a newly created wallet address, which is part of the BTC confiscated from Silk Road Hacker. In addition, <a href="https://coincu.com/202599-ripple-wins-against-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/202599-ripple-wins-against-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple has won a lawsuit</a>, and a series of altcoins considered by the SEC to be securities, including SOL, MATIC, and ATOM, are expected to benefit. Finally, the first spot <a href="https://coincu.com/202409-europes-first-bitcoin-etf-finally-launches/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/202409-europes-first-bitcoin-etf-finally-launches/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETF in Europe</a> is expected to launch in July 2023 after a one-year delay, while Jacobi Asset Management&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF is expected to go live this month, overseen and backed by Fidelity Digital Assets.</p>



<p>FTX opens its gates to prepare for the application process to <a href="https://twitter.com/FTX_Official/status/1678938250658869248?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/FTX_Official/status/1678938250658869248?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reclaim assets</a>. It is not known how long this process will take or how much users will get back the assets left on the exchange, but at least this is a pretty positive sign for the victims of the FTX bankruptcy event. The price of $FTT increased sharply after this news. FTX Portal is open again, if you are being held at FTX, you can fill out the application</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>This week’s prediction</strong></h2>



<p>BTC.D has increased from 39% to 52% since September last year. The current market overview trend is focused on $BTC rather than altcoins. This means that altcoin holders may suffer losses if $BTC drops even slightly. However, this is a positive sign for the overall market overview, as $BTC must rise significantly for new investors to enter the market. Most people enter the crypto market through $BTC, which is the most liquid and traded asset. A strong bull run will only occur when the macroeconomic situation is favorable and new money is invested.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1078.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="475" data-id="203227" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1078-1024x475.png" alt="Market Overview" class="wp-image-203227" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1078-1024x475.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1078-300x139.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1078-768x356.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1078-750x348.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1078-1140x529.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1078.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Market Overview (July 10th to July 16th): Discover the Latest Crypto Market Buzz 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: TradingView – Market Cap BTC Dominance</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul>
<li>The MPI (digger&#8217;s position) indicator shows an increase, indicating the involvement of mining companies. This is leading to faster than usual selling of $BTC. In general, exchange volume is still decreasing.</li>



<li>Over the past two weeks, money flow into funds has gradually increased, but it is not yet comparable to the amount from the entire year. Besides, Stablecoins continue to experience losses.</li>



<li>It can be observed that since November 2022, major fluctuations are mainly due to news related to created stablecoins, rather than natural growth (such as good macro and money flow).</li>
</ul>



<p>The discharge team has mostly disappeared, but the expected influx of new cash flow has not arrived yet. This influx can be considered as fuel for the train to run smoothly. In order to operate smoothly, the train requires a lot of fuel. Currently, the strategy is to slow down and hold onto assets. The market overview cannot rebound immediately. When trading altcoins, individuals should exercise caution. Most current altcoins are expected to decrease by at least 10% when $BTC drops 1-2%.</p>

<p>What sets MakerDAO Lianchuang Rune&#8217;s accumulation strategy apart is its funding source. The proceeds from the sale of LDO coins were utilized to finance the purchase of MKR coins. This approach not only allowed MKR Lianchuang Rune to bolster its MKR holdings but also ensured a sustainable and self-reliant financial strategy.</p>

<p>The accumulation of such a substantial MKR coin holding by MakerDAO Lianchuang Rune indicates their confidence in the future prospects and potential of the MakerDAO ecosystem. As one of the leading decentralized finance platforms, MKR has been gaining traction and recognition within the crypto community. The increased MKR holdings by MakerDAO Lianchuang Rune may have significant implications for the project&#8217;s governance, decision-making, and overall market dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance now enables multiple deposit addresses for enhanced fund management.</em></li>



<li><em>Ethereum network tokens and alternative networks are initially supported.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can generate up to 20 deposit addresses per network, improving flexibility and participation in airdrops.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/users-can-now-deposit-via-multiple-deposit-addresses-on-binance-for-enhanced-efficiency-038e355854bc47a29fee9f60f20abdee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> to user feedback by launching a new feature that allows users to obtain multiple deposit addresses for a single network. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1089.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="549" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1089-1024x549.png" alt="Binance Introduces New Feature For Enhanced Fund Management" class="wp-image-203260" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1089-1024x549.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1089-300x161.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1089-768x412.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1089-750x402.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1089.png 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Introduces New Feature For Enhanced Fund Management 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>This new functionality aims to provide users with greater flexibility and efficiency in managing their funds on the Binance platform. Alongside this feature, Binance has also introduced a deposit address book function to facilitate the seamless management of multiple deposit addresses.</p>



<p>The introduction of multiple deposit addresses on the exchange is particularly beneficial for &#8220;airdrop hunters,&#8221; a term referring to users who actively seek out and participate in token airdrops. This feature has been previously launched on other centralized exchanges (CEXs), and its implementation on Binance is the platform&#8217;s competition and user experience.</p>



<p>Originally, this feature supported multiple deposit addresses for tokens on the Ethereum network (ERC-20) and Ethereum alternative networks like Arbitrum One and BNB Smart Chain. <a href="https://coincu.com/203073-representative-emerges-in-binance-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> plans to expand this functionality to include more blockchains in the future, providing users with a wider range of options.</p>



<p>Each user can generate up to 20 deposit addresses for each supported network, and Binance will regularly review this limit to determine if adjustments are necessary. This periodic evaluation ensures that Binance maintains an optimal balance between user convenience and platform stability.</p>

<p>To get started with the multiple deposit addresses features, users can follow a simple process. First, they need to visit the &#8220;Deposit Crypto&#8221; page on the Binance website or tap on the [Deposit] option in the Binance mobile app. From there, they can select the desired network to view a complete list of available deposit addresses. Users have the option to claim a new deposit address or manage their deposit address book, providing them with full control over their funds.</p>



<p>Binance continues to enhance its platform and address user needs, further solidifying its position as a leading cryptocurrency exchange. The flexibility and convenience provided by multiple deposit addresses empower users to manage their funds efficiently, streamlining their trading and investment activities.</p>



<p>With this latest feature, the exchange aims to provide an exceptional trading experience while prioritizing user satisfaction. Especially in the recent context that the market share of the exchange has been <a href="https://coincu.com/200786-binance-in-crisis-executives-flee-storms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced</a> because of legal issues with the US government.</p>



<p>Recently, the exchange has successfully <a href="https://coincu.com/203199-binance-integrate-btc-on-lightning-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integrated</a> BTC on Lightning Network, and the deposit and withdrawal function has gone live. This initiative aims to leverage Lightning Network’s second-layer solution to enable faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions.</p>

<p>According to her, the SEC is currently benefitting from the lack of legal clarity regarding the classification of cryptocurrencies and that losing an appeal could have serious implications on future enforcement actions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some non-legal advice musings on the Ripple decision, including two main takeaways:<br><br>1/ The Court drew a reasonable line and overall it&#39;s a good outcome for the industry.

<p>On July 13, Judge Torres granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Ripple Labs, regarding XRP&#8217;s status as a security. While some commentators warned that an appeal from the SEC was possible, the CEO of <a href="https://www.haun.co/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.haun.co/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Haun Ventures</a>, Katie Haun, has expressed her doubts about it. She believes that the SEC will most likely remain quiet, as it benefits from the current confusion surrounding the classification of cryptocurrencies. She also stated that losing these issues on appeal would jeopardize the SEC&#8217;s entire enforcement agenda. Therefore, an immediate appeal seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, also believes that it may take years before the SEC lodges an appeal. He stated that an appeal by the SEC would only reinforce Judge Torres’ decision that XRP is not a security. Jeremy Hogan, a U.S. lawyer and Ripple commentator, believes that the SEC will launch an appeal after the trial between SEC and Ripple ends, which is scheduled for early 2024.</p>



<p>The SEC is currently suing crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase over alleged violations of securities laws. Some believe that the recent Ripple case ruling, while not a binding precedent, could have an impact on the outcome of these cases.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, many crypto commentators and lawmakers have called for Congress to take action and provide legal clarity to the cryptocurrency industry. Brian Quintenz, former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and now head of policy for venture capital fund a16z crypto, stated that the recent Ripple court ruling only results in more uncertainty for entrepreneurs and builders. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis said that the ruling underscores the urgent need for Congress to establish a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>Ethscriptions, which was launched last month by Tom Lehman, co-founder and former CEO of <a href="http://genius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genius.com</a>, is a novel method to create Ethereum assets. Although the Ethscriptions&#8217; protocol itself and other applications that tap the technology haven&#8217;t been compromised, a significant number of Ethscriptions listed on <a href="http://ethscriptions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethscriptions.com</a> have been stolen, as per Lehman&#8217;s tweet on Friday.</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;About 123 individual addresses lost a total of about 202 ethscriptions in this exploit. Any young protocol will have bumpy landings, but this is definitely not what I meant.&#8221; It is uncertain how much was lost in terms of value connected to the exploit. Nevertheless, according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, some inscriptions have sold for as much as 5 Ethereum, which equates to around $9,600 in the past month.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Lehman lamented the theft of Ethscription #56 as &#8220;brutal,&#8221; pointing to the rarity often ascribed to earlier artifacts. Moreover, the exploit has a particular sting because it was meant to serve as an example that other marketplaces building out support for Ethscriptions could lean on. &#8220;The purpose of the marketplace was basically to help show other people how to create marketplaces and help build an ecosystem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Unfortunately, we fell on our face in that area.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lehman took responsibility for the failure and explained that the exploit could be traced to a smart contract that he and Indelible Labs co-founder Michael Hirsch created. A snippet of code allowed people to withdraw Ethscriptions that they didn&#8217;t own from the marketplace. &#8220;Part of the challenge with this new protocol is that you save a bunch of money from limiting the use of smart contract storage, but then you have to be more strategic surrounding how you use contracts in cases like marketplaces,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have to figure out a way to either give smart contracts information or make it so smart contracts don’t need that information.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lehman said that the <a href="http://ethscriptions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethscriptions.com</a> marketplace would be relaunched once necessary changes are made to the protocol itself, and he has been in touch with many of those impacted by the exploit. He praised them as &#8220;the earliest adopters&#8221; of the Ethscriptions protocol on Twitter.</p>



<p>Ethscriptions are distinct compared to traditional NFTs, stored in transaction-level data as opposed to being tokens issued on Ethereum by smart contracts, like in the case of the ERC-721 token standard. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, around 474,000 Ethscriptions have been created so far. The protocol&#8217;s emergence follows Ordinals&#8217; popularity, which is used for creating NFT-like assets on Bitcoin and has led to a new wave of experimentation with crypto&#8217;s oldest coin. Lehman drew attention to the exploit on July 14, and a disclaimer about the impacted state of the marketplace remains on <a href="http://ethscriptions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethscriptions.com</a> days later. A warning on the website reads, &#8220;There is an issue with the marketplace contract! Withdraw your Ethscriptions and do not create new listings!&#8221;</p>

<p>Powered by Flip.xyz, Pudgy Swap offers a seamless platform for Huddle members to engage in peer-to-peer trading, facilitating both single-asset and multi-asset swaps.</p>



<p>The standout feature of Pudgy Swap is its zero fees and zero royalties, making it an enticing proposition for traders within the Pudgy Penguins community. Users can easily add messages and generate publicly shareable links to send to their trading partners or friends. Notably, if the trading partner possesses a Flip account, the trade offer notification will appear directly in their app inbox, streamlining the communication process.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1076.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1076-1024x538.png" alt="NFT project PudgyPenguins launches OTC trading solution Pudgy Swap, zero fees and royalties" class="wp-image-203225" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1076-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1076-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1076-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1076-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1076-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1076.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Pudgy Penguins Supports OTC Trading With New Platform Pudgy Swap 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>Trading partners have the flexibility to accept or counter trade offers, fostering a collaborative and user-friendly trading experience. Upon completion of the swap, the details of the transaction will be shared with the user&#8217;s account, ensuring transparency and keeping the Huddle informed of ongoing trading activities.</p>



<p>In addition to traditional exchange-based trading, the announcement highlights the importance of Over-the-Counter (OTC) markets, where buyers and sellers can engage directly without the need for an intermediary trading platform. OTC markets have traditionally catered to large-scale traders, particularly those seeking to transact substantial amounts of cryptocurrency or illiquid assets.</p>



<p>However, OTC markets have evolved to encompass a wide range of valuable assets that may not be available for trading on conventional platforms. This includes items such as project allocations, Discord accounts, exchange accounts, verifications, whitelists, and more. The flexibility and usefulness of OTC trading have been explored extensively in previous articles, showcasing its significance within the digital asset ecosystem.</p>



<p>To illustrate the OTC trading experience, the example of 2TOP OTC, one of the prominent Telegram-based OTC trading platforms, is highlighted. The platform adheres to specific rules for trade offers, with nuances such as limitations on the number of daily messages per user to maintain a clutter-free and efficient trading environment.</p>
