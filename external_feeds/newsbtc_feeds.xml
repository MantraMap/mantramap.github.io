					<description><![CDATA[Justin Sun, the co-founder of Tron, withdrew 30,000 ETH, worth roughly $56 million, via two addresses via Lido, a liquidity staking service provider, on July 10, Lookonchain reveals. Following his move, his Ethereum stake via Lido is down to 263,294 ETH, or $491.6 million at spot rates. Justin Sun Unstakes From Ethereum Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, notes that between February 25 and 27, Sun staked 288,100 ETH, or $538 million, and earned 5,194 ETH, or $9 million. This translates to average daily earnings of 38 ETH, or $72,000, going by the annualized percentage yield (APY) of around 4.87% offered by Lido on Ethereum stakers. Related Reading: Narrow Bitcoin Price Range Suggests Explosive Move Ahead The reasons behind Sun&#8217;s withdrawal of 30,000 ETH from Lido are unclear. It could indicate his intention to sell some of the ETH, transfer to a different staking platform, or even run his private Ethereum validator node. Despite this transfer, Sun remains one of the largest stakers at Lido, accounting for over 9% of the total ETH staked. While Sun&#8217;s decision to unstaked and transfer coins may be a cause of concern, ETH prices are firm when writing on July 10 and edging closer to $1,900. Contrary to fears ahead of the Shanghai upgrade in mid-April, the number of users staking ETH remains upward. Trackers show that over 21 million ETH has been locked by over 657,000 validators as of July 10.  With the Shanghai upgrade implemented, ETH holders who had staked at least 32 ETH in the Beacon Chain from December 2020 can withdraw their assets. Despite earlier fears that more coins will be withdrawn and sold in the spot markets, impacting ETH prices, more validators and more coins have been locked on the Beacon Chain and other staking solutions.  Will The SEC Dampen Coin Staking? Lido, the leading staking provider for ETH, is the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. As of July 10, Lido managed over $14.6 billion of assets, most of which are ETH.  Over $14.5 billion of ETH have been delegated and locked through Lido infrastructure. In Lido, users can stake ETH and other supported coins without needing lock-up periods or meeting high requirements, making it an attractive option for some investors. In lawsuits filed against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase in early June, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that some proof-of-stake coins, including Cardano&#8217;s ADA and Algorand&#8217;s ALGO, were unregistered securities.  Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Tallies 10% Gains On Weekly Chart – Will It Cross $25? Following this assessment, their prices tanked, even impacting ETH. This is partly because Ethereum is now a proof-of-stake network after transiting from a proof-of-work algorithm and uses the same consensus system as those employed by competing smart contract platforms accused of issuing unregistered securities. The situation is worsened by Gary Gensler&#8217;s failure to clarify whether ETH is a utility like Bitcoin.  Cover image from Canvas, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The difficulty of mining Bitcoin has been steadily climbing for some time now, as more and more miners compete with one another to be the one to mine the next block on the Bitcoin blockchain successfully. With the weather now clearing up in Texas, the world&#8217;s Bitcoin mining stronghold, miners are coming back online to double down on their operations. This time around, this has pushed the mining hash rate to a new all-time high. Hash Rate Reaches All-Time High Over the weekend, the mining hash rate reached a new all-time high. According to info from Hashrate Index backed by data from Ycharts, Bitcoin’s hash rate spiked to 465 EH/s on Saturday from 406 EH/s on the previous day. Related Reading: Analyst: Expect Altcoin Season After Bitcoin Halves In 2024 Specifically, the 7-day average hash rate hit 401 EH/s on Saturday, while the 3-day average has risen a more staggering 18% to 448 EH/s. Although the hash rate has now dropped to 425 EH/s at the time of writing, it is still at its highest levels and up more than 119.1% from one year ago.  The increase in the hash rate has naturally led to an increase in the block production rate. Over the last couple of months, BTC miners had been targeting a block production rate of 6 per hour, now, a block is produced at an average time of 9 minutes and 15 seconds. BTC price recovers above $30,600 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Mining Revenue Hits $184 Million In Q2 Bitcoin has seen a flurry of increase in transaction volumes this year, as the cryptocurrency continues to dominate the industry. In the past 24 hours alone, the total volume of bitcoin traded increased by 30.37%.  According to a report by published by Coin Metrics on July 5, BTC miners generated a remarkable revenue of $2.4 billion during the second quarter of 2023. Out of this amount, $184 million came from transaction fees alone, representing more than the five preceding quarters combined.  This increase in transaction fee revenue is traced to the increase in transaction volume after BRC-20 tokens were introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain. The BRC-20 came in as a token standard to allow the creation and transfer facilities of fungible tokens on the blockchain through the use of ordinal inscriptions.

Bitcoin miners have also experienced favorable macroeconomic conditions in the last quarter, including lower electricity rates for miners based in the United States. On the other hand, Bitcoin mining has been growing in the Middle East, with the UAE leading the charge. Miners in the UAE now produce approximately 13 EH/s, accounting for almost 4% of the total hash rate.  As for Bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency has been ranging in the $30,000 mark since late June.

					<description><![CDATA[The price of Bitcoin is stuck at its current levels as bulls and bears fight for control. The number one cryptocurrency by market cap experienced some gains in the past weeks, but volatility across the board declined, leading to the current dynamic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Go On $2.15 Billion Buying Spree, Is It Time To Sell? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $30,500 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has recorded a 2% loss while the rest of the sector follows and records steeper losses. Google Metric Hints At Profits For Bitcoin? According to analyst Dylan LeClair, Google searches for Bitcoin Price have declined since 2023. The chart below shows that searches for this keyword decreased since 2021. At that time, BTC was on a bull run and managed to climb as high as $69,000 from a $3,000 low last seen in March 2020. In that sense, Google searches for Bitcoin Price operate as a proxy to gauge interest in the cryptocurrency. Interest from mainstream media and non-crypto investors follows the price of the cryptocurrency. The higher the interest the chart hints at, the higher the price. Conversely, interest declines as the price of the cryptocurrency declines. Historical interest in the keyword “Bitcoin price” on Google has fluctuated to the upside, as the chart below shows. In the 2017 to 2018 bull run, the monthly searches for this keyword rose to unprecedented levels, but the percentile has been consistent on the downside since 2019 before BTC can resume its bullish momentum. In other words, since 2017, BTC only enters a bull-run phase when interest declines to a certain point; the metric is close to those levels. LeClair stated the following while pointing out: Bitcoin price vs. Google Search Interest. The bottom pane shows the ratio of the two ( $BTC price / search interest percentile). Notice how price relative to media hype &#38; search interest is up and to the right? Think about it&#8230; On when BTC could break its current price action, analyst and NewsBTC Editorial Director Tony Spilotro pointed at the Bollinger Bands. An indicator that gauges potential spikes in volatility and price action. Related Reading: Analyst: Expect Altcoin Season After Bitcoin Halves In 2024 Spilotro stated while sharing the chart below: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands are the tightest on the daily since the start of 2023. The last time they were this tight we had a 40% up move. Another 40% higher from here would be $42,000. Cover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview]]></description>

<h2>Google Metric Hints At Profits For Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>According to analyst Dylan LeClair, Google searches for Bitcoin Price have <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1678444907373969408" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">declined</a> since 2023. The chart below shows that searches for this keyword decreased since 2021.</p>
<p>At that time, BTC was on a bull run and managed to climb as high as $69,000 from a $3,000 low last seen in March 2020. In that sense, Google searches for Bitcoin Price operate as a proxy to gauge interest in the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Interest from mainstream media and non-crypto investors follows the price of the cryptocurrency. The higher the interest the chart hints at, the higher the price.</p>
<p>Conversely, interest declines as the price of the cryptocurrency declines. Historical interest in the keyword “Bitcoin price” on Google has fluctuated to the upside, as the chart below shows.</p>
<p>In the 2017 to 2018 bull run, the monthly searches for this keyword rose to unprecedented levels, but the percentile has been consistent on the downside since 2019 before BTC can resume its bullish momentum.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-542063" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2-460x456.jpeg" alt="Bitcoin BTC BTCUSDT Chart 2" width="460" height="456" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2-460x456.jpeg 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2-860x853.jpeg 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2-768x761.jpeg 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2-42x42.jpeg 42w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2-75x75.jpeg 75w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2-750x744.jpeg 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2-1140x1130.jpeg 1140w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-BTC-BTCUSDT-Chart-2.jpeg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"/>
<p>In other words, since 2017, BTC only enters a bull-run phase when interest declines to a certain point; the metric is close to those levels. LeClair stated the following while pointing out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin price vs. Google Search Interest. The bottom pane shows the ratio of the two ( $BTC price / search interest percentile). Notice how price relative to media hype &amp; search interest is up and to the right? Think about it&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>On when BTC could break its current price action, analyst and NewsBTC Editorial Director Tony Spilotro pointed at the Bollinger Bands. An indicator that gauges potential spikes in volatility and price action.</p>

<p>Spilotro stated while <a href="https://twitter.com/tonythebullBTC/status/1678480455677407240" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sharing</a> the chart below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin Bollinger Bands are the tightest on the daily since the start of 2023. The last time they were this tight we had a 40% up move. Another 40% higher from here would be $42,000.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating below the mid-point of the 2021-22 cycle at $30,000, with some on-chain activity metrics cooling off while others, such as money transfer volumes, are picking up. This suggests positive momentum and growing adoption for the asset, according to a recent report from Glassnode. Bitcoin Metrics Suggest A Wild Ride Ahead The report highlights that BTC&#8217;s recovery in 2023 has been remarkably robust in terms of price performance and network utilization, indicating strong underlying demand for the asset.  Active address momentum is climbing again, indicating a healthy network and growing adoption of Bitcoin. The balance of supply held in profit vs. loss has reached an equilibrium point, synonymous with the several months-long &#8216;re-accumulation period&#8217; in past cycles. Related Reading: Analyst: Expect Altcoin Season After Bitcoin Halves In 2024 Moreover, the report suggests that BTC volumes being transferred are starting to pick up meaningfully. BTC changing hands, lifting 75% off the FTX lows, now reaching $4.2 billion per day in total settlement. This is a positive sign for the Bitcoin network, indicating a return toward the dominance of BTC monetary transfers. The report also provides a chart demonstrating a significant supply cluster between $15,000 and $30,000, indicating that many coins changed hands over the last 12 months. Conversely, just 25% of the supply was acquired at prices above $30,000, held by buyers from the 2021-22 cycle.  Furthermore, the Long and Short-Term heuristic shows that a sizeable volume of long-term holders (LTH) supply was acquired between $15,000 and $25,000 and remains unspent, despite prices reaching $31,000. Additionally, almost all coins with an acquisition price above $30,000 are held by LTHs, who are likely to create resistance should the market rally higher. Moreover, the report further highlights that the price range between $20,000 and $30,000 has seen expanding accumulation since February, despite regulatory pressure in the US. This supply distribution is quite &#8216;bottom-heavy,&#8217; suggesting a relatively firm foundation of investor holdings exists below $30,000. BTC’s Independence From Altcoins On The Rise Bitcoin&#8217;s correlation with altcoins has declined in the first half of 2023, according to a report by Kaiko, a cryptocurrency market data provider.  The report shows that altcoins have been hit hard by rising regulatory uncertainty in the US, with several exchanges delisting major altcoins over the past few weeks. In contrast, Bitcoin has shown resilience, attracting institutional inflows and benefiting from regulatory clarity around its status as a commodity. Related Reading: Arkham’s New Crypto Intel Trading Platform: A Game Changer For Traders? The report highlights that Bitcoin&#8217;s correlation with other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, has declined significantly since last year.  The decline in correlation is a sign that Bitcoin is becoming less influenced by the movements of other cryptocurrencies, indicating that it is starting to establish itself as a more independent asset. XRP saw the strongest decrease in correlation, which is linked to the token&#8217;s rising volatility as the outcome of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit edges closer. The report indicates that XRP&#8217;s volatility has increased significantly in recent months, leading to a sharp decline in its correlation with other cryptocurrencies. The report suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience in the face of regulatory uncertainty is largely due to its status as a commodity, which has been confirmed by regulatory bodies such as the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  On BTC&#8217;s one-day chart, the largest cryptocurrency in the market is currently trading at $30,500, reflecting a 0.9% increase over the past 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[Despite facing a challenging period in recent months, the price of Litecoin has demonstrated a significant upward trajectory. In June, LTC experienced a decline to $71; however, the bulls subsequently took charge and initiated a recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Says BTC Is Overpriced, Decline Soon? Nevertheless, over the past week, LTC&#8217;s progress slowed, with the coin retracing below the $100 mark and experiencing a loss of approximately 12%. On the daily chart, LTC witnessed a 1.5% decline. Although the coin experienced a significant devaluation on the weekly chart, the bullish sentiment remains. The technical analysis of Litecoin indicates that the bulls are currently dominant, with a minor retracement in demand and accumulation. As Bitcoin also retraced on its chart recently, other altcoins, including Litecoin, observed depreciation. Currently, Litecoin is in a crucial price zone ranging from $90 to $94. Sustaining a price above the $94 mark is expected to provide impetus for LTC to resume its upward trajectory. The market capitalization of LTC reflects a higher presence of sellers compared to buyers in the market. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, LTC was priced at $95. The altcoin attempted to increase in value after successfully holding the $94 support level. The immediate resistance for LTC was observed at $97. The bullish sentiment remained intact for LTC as it managed to stay above the bearish order block (marked in red) formed in mid-April. Surpassing the $97 mark would propel Litecoin to challenge the $100 threshold and potentially move beyond the upper boundary of the bearish order block at $103. Conversely, if LTC fails to maintain its current level, there is a risk of breaching the $94 support, which may invite the bears back into the market. Technical Analysis Following its surge above the $100 threshold, LTC experienced a pullback as it entered an overbought condition. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained slightly above the half-line, indicating that buyers still maintained control in the market, particularly as the coin held above the crucial support level. Furthermore, LTC remained above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, signaling buyers were driving the price momentum. LTC needs to surpass the immediate resistance level in the upcoming trading sessions to sustain its upward trajectory. LTC has experienced notable capital inflows, indicating that investor interest has remained positive, as evidenced by the Chaikin Money Flow indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Go On $2.15 Billion Buying Spree, Is It Time To Sell? This indicates a sustained bullish outlook on the chart. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands, which reflect price volatility and fluctuation, are currently wide open. This suggests that LTC may undergo significant price action and volatility in the upcoming trading sessions. Featured image from UnSplash, charts from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>This indicates a sustained bullish outlook on the chart. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands, which reflect price volatility and fluctuation, are currently wide open. This suggests that LTC may undergo significant price action and volatility in the upcoming trading sessions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is showing resilience in the face of adversity and is up nearly 100% from bear market lows.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data compiled by Santiment, an analytics platform, shows that more people are discussing XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), per statistics captured on July 10. In their assessment, the spike in social chatter, translating to higher social dominance, will most likely draw demand for the crypto asset that has recently been under selling pressure but firm. The rise in XRP&#8217;s social dominance is the highest since May, suggesting that market sentiment could change. Despite this increment, XRP prices are relatively muted, stable on the last trading day, but unable to break above $0.50, a psychological reaction level.  XRP Social Dominance Rising, Will Prices Rally? Over the past few weeks, Santiment data shows that XRP&#8217;s social volume drawn from social media activity has been relatively low. This could be due to several factors, the main one being the lack of significant updates on the legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breakout Alert: Potential 30% Rally Looming Beyond the lawsuit pitting the blockchain company and the regulator who has been, in recent days, cracking the whip on crypto firms, crypto prices have been soft, and XRP has been no exception. To illustrate, although the coin is firm, bulls failed to push prices above the $0.58 level. Presently, XRP is down roughly 20% from H1 2023 highs. Primary support is at around $0.45, marking June 2023 lows. Comparing the current surge in social dominance to previous instances in May, Santiment draws attention to the correlation between increased social activity and XRP price expansions. When XRP&#8217;s social dominance peaked at 7.4% in May, prices, the analytics platform observed, rose in lock-step.  Meanwhile, when XRP&#8217;s social dominance decreased in May, its price also fell. Therefore, while the social dominance of XRP is firm in early July, it remains to be seen whether bulls will flow back and pump prices higher toward the $0.60 liquidation line. Bullish Signals According to Santiment, rising XRP social dominance in the current environment when prices are weak could signal that bulls may offer support in upcoming sessions. In turn, this may inject optimism and momentum considering the recent fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in crypto primarily due to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuits against two of the world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, in June. Related Reading: XRP FUD Spikes, Will This Trigger A Price Reversal? The SEC alleges that among other coins, ADA, the native currency of Cardano, and ALGO, the token priming the Algorand ecosystem, are unregistered securities. At the same time, in December 2020, the regulator filed a lawsuit claiming that Ripple, the blockchain company, raised billions using XRP.  Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[PancakeSwap (CAKE), a decentralized trading platform, has partnered with Google Cloud to ensure the availability and reliability of its infrastructure.  As the demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) grows, PancakeSwap aims to offer users a user-friendly platform to trade their assets without intermediaries.  PancakeSwap And Google Cloud Collaboration Moreover, PancakeSwap leverages Google Kubernetes Engine to scale its nodes quickly and accurately predict traffic spikes with the help of the PreditKube solution from Dysnix. Dysnix&#8217;s PreditKube solution helped PancakeSwap accurately predict traffic spikes and automate the up-and-down scaling of blockchain nodes ahead of time to manage the anticipated traffic surge. This approach ensured that PancakeSwap&#8217;s infrastructure could handle a fluctuating number of requests with high scalability, maintaining an uptime of 99.99%. Related Reading: Arkham’s New Crypto Intel Trading Platform: A Game Changer For Traders? Dysnix says their PreditKube solution accurately predicts more than 90% of traffic spikes on PancakeSwap. By automating the up-and-down scaling of nodes, PancakeSwap managed the anticipated traffic surge and reduced its infrastructure costs by more than 30%.  One of the critical challenges for any trading platform is ensuring the security of smart contracts. PancakeSwap works with various audit firms to identify potential loopholes and leverages Cloud Armor to filter sensitive data.  With its smart contracts secured, PancakeSwap aims to expand its services by adding more chains and exploring non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Moreover, to improve users&#8217; trading experience, PancakeSwap plans to leverage BigQuery to manage and analyze historical blockchain data. By simplifying complex data, PancakeSwap aims to make blockchain trading accessible to everyone.  With Google Cloud&#8217;s fully managed services, PancakeSwap&#8217;s engineers can focus on developing new features and improving the user experience rather than dealing with infrastructure issues. Chef Jojo, Technical Lead at PancakeSwap, stated: At one point, we had more than one billion requests on the BNB Chain, but this is changing all the time due to the BNB network changes, among other variables. With Google Kubernetes Engine, we can quickly scale up when there are many requests. Google Cloud Boosts CAKE Token Value PancakeSwap&#8217;s native token, CAKE, has seen a 3.9% increase in value within the last 24 hours following the announcement of its partnership with Google Cloud.  Currently, CAKE is trading at $1.517 after being range-bound between $1.454 and $1.481 for the past four days. The partnership with Google Cloud has provided the much-needed momentum for CAKE to break out of this range and continue its upward trend. However, CAKE is now facing a significant resistance level at $1.525, which has not been surpassed since July 6th.  On the other hand,  PancakeSwap&#8217;s market cap (circulating) is currently at $327.94 million, representing a decline of 1.10% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, its fully diluted market cap stands at $1.13 billion, representing a decline of 5.73%. According to data from Token Terminal, PancakeSwap&#8217;s revenue for the past 30 days is at $1.41 million, marking a decrease of 31.55% from the previous period. Similarly, its annualized revenue is $17.11 million, representing a decrease of 39.79%. Related Reading: US Presidential Candidate Robert F.

On the other hand, the platform&#8217;s trading volume (annualized) is at $48.50 billion, indicating a decrease of 25.66% from the previous period. Data also shows that PancakeSwap&#8217;s P/S ratio (fully diluted) is at 64.25x, representing an increase of 38.0%.

					<description><![CDATA[A crypto analyst on Twitter expects altcoin prices to be muted in the second half of 2023. Data indicate that the fate of altcoins and the possibility of an &#8220;alt season&#8221; is highly dependent on the performance of Bitcoin. Being the foremost cryptocurrency and market leader, according to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin&#8217;s impact on altcoins cannot be underestimated. Altcoins Are In Accumulation Phase, Waiting On Bitcoin? In his assessment, altcoins are currently in the &#8220;accumulation phase,&#8221; which has kept the sector at a market cap between $290 billion and $460 billion for the past few trading months. This trend, he forecasts, will likely continue until next year, when Bitcoin is expected to halve its block reward to 3.125 BTC.  Considering the performance of Bitcoin after past halving events, the cryptocurrency could see further profits as the event nears.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crypto analyst on Twitter <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/IamZeroIka/status/1678114847639076864" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expects</a> altcoin prices to be muted in the second half of 2023. Data indicate that the fate of altcoins and the possibility of an &#8220;alt season&#8221; is highly dependent on the performance of Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Being the foremost cryptocurrency and market leader, according to CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data</a>, Bitcoin&#8217;s impact on altcoins cannot be underestimated.</p>
<h2>Altcoins Are In Accumulation Phase, Waiting On Bitcoin?
</h2>
<p>In his assessment, altcoins are currently in the &#8220;accumulation phase,&#8221; which has kept the sector at a market cap between $290 billion and $460 billion for the past few trading months. This trend, he forecasts, will likely continue until next year, when Bitcoin is expected to halve its block reward to 3.125 BTC. </p>
<p>Considering the performance of Bitcoin after past halving events, the cryptocurrency could see further profits as the event nears. This, in turn, factoring in the direct correlation between Bitcoin and altcoins, will likely trigger an &#8220;altcoin season.&#8221;</p>

<p>To cement his market preview, he shared a screenshot depicting the total market capitalization of altcoins excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, revealing extended periods of sideways trading during previous bear markets. Extending from this outlook, the analyst expects altcoins&#8217; price movements to be limited until after the halving event, as seen in the chart below. </p>
