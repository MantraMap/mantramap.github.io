The first of two key events in a historic week for Bitcoin and financial markets worldwide is in the books. While the CPI release was today at 8:30 ET, the last FOMC meeting of the year is scheduled to take place tomorrow featuring a new dot plot. CPI and FOMC coincide this week for the first time in a while, making it blockbuster week for Bitcoin. And drum roll! The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the November figures for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Core CPI a few minutes ago. The expectation for CPI was 7.3% CPI (0.3% MoM), up from 7.7% (0.4% MoM) in October. Core CPI was expected at 6.1% (0.3% MoM), and was 6.3% (0.3% MoM) the previous month.

Thus, the CPI comes in 0.2% better than expected. Core CPI was 6.0 % in November, falling by 0.3% from the previous month. Compared to the prediction, Core CPI is 0.1% below expectation. Inflation dropping. US November CPI +7.1% y/y vs +7.3% expected. Send it all. &#8212; The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) December 13, 2022 Already in the run-up to the print, the bulls pushed the Bitcoin price up in anticipation of positive data. The price stood at around $17,550 before the announcement. After the release, the price reacted extremely bullish to the news along with the S&#38;P 500. The latter is currently breaking out of a year-long downtrend.

What Will The Federal Reserve Do With The Data? Prior to the CPI data release, the market was forecasting a rate hike of 50 bps with a 72% probability, according to the CME FedWatch tool. This is compared to a 28% probability of a 75 bps hike. Within the next few hours, it remains to be seen how this rate will shift due to the CPI print. At press time, however, the probability of a 50 basis point jumped significantly to 79.4%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Today&#8217;s CPI print has thus further increased the probability for 50 bps tomorrow.

As it turns out, JP Morgan was almost spot on with this assessment. JP Morgan assigned only a 15% chance to the 7.1% outcome and predicted that this could mean increases of 4% to 5% for the S&#38;P 500. Goldman Sachs forecasts that today&#8217;s CPI print could mean a 2% to 3% increase for the S&#38;P 500. However, ultimately the FED will decide tomorrow what to do with the CPI data. As NewsBTC reported, it will also publish the dot plot, which reflects the central bank&#8217;s long-term expectations and outlook. So whether the rally will find a continuation or abruptly stop will depend on whether the FED plays along.
