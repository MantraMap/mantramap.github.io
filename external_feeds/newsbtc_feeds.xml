					<description><![CDATA[South Park&#8217;s Kenny McCormick may be perpetually doomed, but his latest venture in the world of cryptocurrency is anything but. Burn Kenny, the new hilariously irreverent meme coin has raised over $400,000 in market cap on its presale, leaving fans excited for what&#8217;s to come.  Inspired by the beloved South Park character, Burn Kenny is a super deflationary token that&#8217;s designed to do one thing &#8211; get burnt. How Burn Kenny&#8217;s Meme Coin Token Burning Could Benefit Investors Burn Kenny&#8217;s token burning process is designed to gradually decrease the total supply of the token, creating scarcity and potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. The process works by gradually burning a portion of the total token supply over a set period until a predetermined percentage of the tokens have been destroyed. In Burn Kenny&#8217;s case, 30% of the total token supply will be burnt over three days, starting 24 hours after the token&#8217;s initial listing. This will be done by sending a portion of the tokens straight to the &#8220;fiery depths of token hell,&#8221; effectively removing them from circulation. The burning process will continue at a rate of 10% every 24 hours until the 30% burn target is reached. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Users Plunge Amid Declining Network Revenue The value of the remaining tokens could potentially increase as a result of the token-burning process, as there will be fewer tokens in circulation.  This creates a situation of increased demand for the remaining tokens, which could drive up their price. With a total token supply of 6,666,666,666, an arbitrary number Burn Kenny&#8217;s tokenomics are as unique as the character himself.  The presale accounts for 40% of the total token supply, while another 30% will be thrown into the Uniswap liquidity pool, locked for three months. The remaining 30% will be sent straight to the fiery depths of token hell, gradually burnt over three days, starting 24 hours after listing. By the end of Q3 2023, the team behind Burn Kenny aims to have fulfilled all their roadmap goals.  In recent updates, they have announced that they have deployed the contract, paired and locked Liquidity Pool (LP), and updated DexTools with hot pairs ready for trading. These preparations are all essential steps in ensuring a smooth and successful launch for Burn Kenny. Deploying the contract and pairing and locking LP are key technical components of the launch process. The contract deployment involves setting up the smart contract that will govern the token and ensure its functionality.  In addition to these technical preparations, the Burn Kenny team has also been working to build hype and generate excitement for the launch. They have noted that Ethereum is trending and that DexTools is ready for hot pairs, which could help to drive interest and increase demand for the token. Related Reading: New Crypto Bill Demands SEC And CFTC To Draft Rules For Trading Platforms Burn Kenny&#8217;s irreverent approach to cryptocurrency and its use of the South Park character Kenny McCormick as its mascot give it a distinct personality and make it stand out from other meme coins.

However, its unique concept and approach to the meme coin genre could potentially make it a standout project in the crowded world of cryptocurrency.

					<description><![CDATA[2023 has seen the rise of AI, with programs such as Bard and ChatGPT offering answers to any and all queries, ranging from what the weather is to writing college essays. We all know AI is based on machine learning, but how much can we trust the advice it gives? We wanted to find out if we can trust these programs, so we gave ChatGPT a budget of $10k to invest in stocks and $10k to invest in cryptocurrencies, subsequently following the advice provided.  Before following this advice, it is worth noting ChatGPT states the information given is not financial advice, and consulting with a financial advisor is always recommended. ChatGPT also suggests doing your own research to make more informed decisions regarding which stocks are worth investing in. The program provides further advice for cryptocurrencies, stressing the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the importance of considering your financial situation when making investment decisions. Regularly reviewing your portfolio based on market conditions and investment performance is also advised. The Breakdown It took a little bit of training, but we eventually got ChatGPT to suggest exactly how much of my budget to invest in each stock/ coin, the breakdown is as follows: &#160; Stock Percentage Total Invested Apple Inc 10% $1000 Amazon.com Inc 10% $1000 Microsoft Corporation 9% $900 Alphabet Inc 9% $900 NVIDIA Corporation 8% $800 Tesla Inc 7% $700 NextEra Energy, Inc 7% $700 Amgen Inc 4% $400 Johnson &#38; Johnson 4% $400 Moderna, Inc 4% $400 Pfizer Inc 4% $400 Gilead Sciences, Inc 3% $300 PayPal Holdings Inc 3% $300 General Motors Company 3% $300 NIO Inc 3% $300 First Solar, Inc 2% $200 Enphase Energy, Inc 2% $200 Shopify Inc 2% $200 Vestas Wind Systems A/S 2% $200 MercadoLibre, Inc 1% $100 Johnson Controls International plc 1% $100 Square, Inc 1% $100 Rivian 1% $100 Coin Percentage Total Invested Bitcoin 20% $2000 Ethereum 20% $2000 Binance Coin 10% $1000 Litecoin 10% $1000 Solana 10% $1000 Polkadot 10% $1000 Ripple 10% $1000 Cardano 10% $1000 The suggested stocks are rather expected; higher investments in stable stocks and a lower investment into stocks with more fluctuations. The cryptocurrency investments are slightly more interesting, however, as, of the 1000+ coins currently on the market, it’s given me a short list of eight to invest in.  &#160; The Experiment The first week The experiment started off on unsteady legs with stocks ending with a profit of $159 and cryptocurrencies making a loss of $64 after the first day. Five of the eight cryptocurrencies invested in made a loss, with Binance Coin performing the worst, with our $956 investment suffering a $44 decrease. Stocks increased throughout the week but decreased right at the end ($25 lower compared to the previous day), making the final weekly total $10,220. This is a $220 increase from the initial investment, a solid start for our experiment. Our crypto investment did not perform nearly as well in the first week, with only three  days ending in a profit from the initial $10k investment. The fourth day was the worst of our whole experiment, with an ending total of $9,741. Only two of the coins invested turned a profit on that day, with Ethereum making a loss of $114 from the initial investment. Our week ended on a slightly more positive note with a final total of $10,021, a $21 increase from the initial investment. &#160; The second week During the second week,  the total reached $10,643 by the end of the second day. This is $423 more than the total at the end of week one. However, this high was short-lived as the final value decreased for the remainder of the week, ending on $10,492. Whilst $272 more than the final value of the first week, it’s $151 less than the second day’s total. After a shaky beginning, our cryptocurrency investment far outperformed our stocks investment in the second week, peaking at $11,118 on the fourth day. This then decreased on the fifth and final day, making the final value of the week $10,987, a $967 increase from the first week. &#160; The third week The start of the third week saw more decreases for our stocks investments. Nine of our 23 investments decreased on the second and third day. The latter half of the week performed better, increasing to $10,559 in total by the final day. Our cryptocurrency investment performed similarly, with a decrease at the start of the week and an increase towards the end. The final value dropped to $10,609 on the fourth day, then increased dramatically to $10,974 by the end of the fifth. The final value of the week was $11,402, a $415 increase from week two. &#160; The final week The final week of our stock investments was a disappointment with the overall value decreasing slightly for a final figure of $10,587. This is an overall increase of $587 from our initial investment, which is an overall ROI of 6%. On the first day of the final week, our crypto investments increased by $314 to $11,719 in total, this is the highest end of day total we reached in our experiment. This was the high point, however, as we decreased throughout the rest of the week, ending with a final total of $11,359, a 14% ROI. &#160; Overall Performance Stocks Whilst we ended up turning a profit from our stock investments, there were ten investments which made a loss from the initial investment, almost 45% of investments made. The worst-performing stock was Pfizer inc. which decreased from the third week and ended up with an ROI of -10%. This was after the company announced they were discontinuing the development of the type 2 diabetes and obesity candidate lotiglipron over safety concerns.  Rivian proved the best-performing stock, with an ROI of 88%, initially priced at $14.03 per stock it increased to $25.51 over the month. This is after the company announced that Q2 2023 was the best financial quarter in the company’s history. &#160; Cryptocurrency On the other hand, we had much more luck with our crypto investments, with only one of the investments returning a loss, making up 13% of the initial investment. This was Ripple (XRP), there are several reasons for this, one being that the transaction volume of XRP is down 90%. The coin with the highest ROI is Solana (SOL) with an ROI of 39%, which is a $389 increase. SOL is considered a relatively stable coin with strong community backing, making it a good coin to invest in. Hits or Misses? Whilst it’s possible Bitcoin was suggested as one of the largest investments because it’s the biggest cryptocurrency. It was actually a great crypto to invest in as the price went from $26k to $30k, this was due to news that a new, safer, crypto exchange launched, receiving investments from Invesco and WisdomTree. There is one stock we feel could have been missed from ChatGPT’s suggestions, this is Meta, the company who owns Facebook and Instagram. They’ve recently released a new app as part of Instagram called Threads, a Twitter competitor. It was released at the perfect time, after news that Twitter was limiting the number of Tweets its users could see.  This isn’t one of the stocks ChatGPT suggested investing in, so we wanted to see what could have happened had ChatGPT suggested investing in META stocks. Using historical data for the last month, we calculated that if we had invested $1,000, we would have $1,100 by the end of the experiment. This is more than we earned from the $1,000 we invested in Amazon and Apple stocks. Methodology We started by asking ChatGPT for stock market opportunities. Initially, it gave a generic answer of the types of industries which should be invested in and why. From these industries, we asked it to recommend specific companies from each. We then sent the list of all the suggested stocks back to it and asked for a weighting of a $10k investment. We found that one of the stocks suggested, Waymo, is not a publicly traded business, we had to go back to ChatGPT and ask for it to remove this stock and add a new one. It was replaced by Johnson Controls International plc. It was a much easier process to get answers about which cryptocurrencies to invest in. As ChatGPT gave us an initial list of coins, and when asked how much to invest in each it gave a general strategy for investing in cryptocurrency. 40-50% should come from Bitcoin and Ethereum combined and 10-20% for each of the remaining coins. We decided to put 20% into Bitcoin, 20% into Ethereum and 10% for the remaining coins.]]></description>

Five of the eight cryptocurrencies invested in made a loss, with Binance Coin performing the worst, with our $956 investment suffering a $44 decrease.</p>
<p>Stocks increased throughout the week but decreased right at the end ($25 lower compared to the previous day), making the final weekly total $10,220. This is a $220 increase from the initial investment, a solid start for our experiment.</p>
<p>Our crypto investment did not perform nearly as well in the first week, with only three  days ending in a profit from the initial $10k investment. The fourth day was the worst of our whole experiment, with an ending total of $9,741. Only two of the coins invested turned a profit on that day, with Ethereum making a loss of $114 from the initial investment. Our week ended on a slightly more positive note with a final total of $10,021, a $21 increase from the initial investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The second week
<p>During the second week,  the total reached $10,643 by the end of the second day. This is $423 more than the total at the end of week one. However, this high was short-lived as the final value decreased for the remainder of the week, ending on $10,492. Whilst $272 more than the final value of the first week, it’s $151 less than the second day’s total.</p>
<p>After a shaky beginning, our cryptocurrency investment far outperformed our stocks investment in the second week, peaking at $11,118 on the fourth day. This then decreased on the fifth and final day, making the final value of the week $10,987, a $967 increase from the first week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The third week
<p>The start of the third week saw more decreases for our stocks investments. Nine of our 23 investments decreased on the second and third day. The latter half of the week performed better, increasing to $10,559 in total by the final day.</p>
<p>Our cryptocurrency investment performed similarly, with a decrease at the start of the week and an increase towards the end. The final value dropped to $10,609 on the fourth day, then increased dramatically to $10,974 by the end of the fifth. The final value of the week was $11,402, a $415 increase from week two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The final week
<p>The final week of our stock investments was a disappointment with the overall value decreasing slightly for a final figure of $10,587. This is an overall increase of $587 from our initial investment, which is an overall ROI of 6%.</p>
<p>On the first day of the final week, our crypto investments increased by $314 to $11,719 in total, this is the highest end of day total we reached in our experiment. This was the high point, however, as we decreased throughout the rest of the week, ending with a final total of $11,359, a 14% ROI.</p>

<p>Whilst we ended up turning a profit from our stock investments, there were ten investments which made a loss from the initial investment, almost 45% of investments made. The worst-performing stock was Pfizer inc. which decreased from the third week and ended up with an ROI of -10%. This was after the company announced they were <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/26/why-pfizer-stock-is-tanking-today/" rel="nofollow">discontinuing the development</a> of the type 2 diabetes and obesity candidate lotiglipron over safety concerns. </p>
<p>Rivian proved the best-performing stock, with an ROI of 88%, initially priced at $14.03 per stock it increased to $25.51 over the month. This is after the <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/676385/rivian-stock-up-almost-90-percent-past-two-weeks/" rel="nofollow">company announced</a> that Q2 2023 was the best financial quarter in the company’s history.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we had much more luck with our crypto investments, with only one of the investments returning a loss, making up 13% of the initial investment. This was Ripple (XRP), there are several reasons for this, one being that the transaction volume of XRP is <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-remains-stagnant-whale-investment/" rel="nofollow">down 90%.</a></p>
<p>The coin with the highest ROI is Solana (SOL) with an ROI of 39%, which is a $389 increase. SOL is considered a relatively stable coin with strong community backing, making it a good coin to invest in.</p>
<h2><b>Hits or Misses?</b></h2>
<p>Whilst it’s possible Bitcoin was suggested as one of the largest investments because it’s the biggest cryptocurrency. It was actually a great crypto to invest in as the price went from $26k to $30k, this was due to news that a <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/21/bitcoin-30000-highest-price-in-more-than-a-year-spot-etfs/" rel="nofollow">new, safer, crypto exchange</a> launched, receiving investments from Invesco and WisdomTree.</p>
<p>There is one stock we feel could have been missed from ChatGPT’s suggestions, this is Meta, the company who owns Facebook and Instagram. They’ve recently released a new app as part of Instagram called Threads, a Twitter competitor. It was released at the perfect time, after news that <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-limits" rel="nofollow">Twitter was limiting</a> the number of Tweets its users could see. </p>
<p>This isn’t one of the stocks ChatGPT suggested investing in, so we wanted to see what could have happened had ChatGPT suggested investing in META stocks. Using historical data for the last month, we calculated that if we had invested $1,000, we would have $1,100 by the end of the experiment. This is more than we earned from the $1,000 we invested in Amazon and Apple stocks.</p>
<h2><b>Methodology</b></h2>
<p>We started by asking ChatGPT for stock market opportunities. Initially, it gave a generic answer of the types of industries which should be invested in and why. From these industries, we asked it to recommend specific companies from each. We then sent the list of all the suggested stocks back to it and asked for a weighting of a $10k investment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-543773 size-large" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image4-37-860x568.png" alt="" width="860" height="568" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image4-37-860x568.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image4-37-460x304.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image4-37-768x507.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image4-37-750x495.png 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image4-37-1140x753.png 1140w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image4-37.png 1379w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"/></p>
<p>We found that one of the stocks suggested, Waymo, is not a publicly traded business, we had to go back to ChatGPT and ask for it to remove this stock and add a new one. It was replaced by Johnson Controls International plc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-543775" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image5-39-860x571.png" alt="" width="860" height="571" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image5-39-860x571.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image5-39-460x306.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image5-39-768x510.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image5-39-750x498.png 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image5-39-1140x758.png 1140w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image5-39.png 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"/></p>
<p>It was a much easier process to get answers about which cryptocurrencies to invest in. As ChatGPT gave us an initial list of coins, and when asked how much to invest in each it gave a general strategy for investing in cryptocurrency. 40-50% should come from Bitcoin and Ethereum combined and 10-20% for each of the remaining coins. We decided to put 20% into Bitcoin, 20% into Ethereum and 10% for the remaining coins.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The second quarter of 2023 brought significant challenges for the Ethereum network as its revenue experienced a sharp decline. Ethereum network revenue plummeted from $1.27 billion to $847 million during Q2, representing a staggering 33.3% drop.  The network revenue for Ethereum encompasses all transaction fees paid by users to Ether validators, as well as the portion of charges that are removed from circulation through burning.  Given this, the decline in revenue reflects the decrease in overall activity on the platform, especially in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, where developments have been far from welcoming. Related Reading: Terraform Labs Appoints New CEO Following Do Kwon’s Sentencing In Montenegro During Q2 2023, the DeFi market faced a lean period, characterized by a lack of significant growth and unfavorable events. Notably, hack incidents in the DeFi sector increased by a staggering 63% during the quarter, resulting in losses of $228 million across 79 hacks. This was confirmed by Arltduv, a Crypto Directory in a Twitter Post on July 20, 2023.  These incidents have had a negative impact on user confidence and contributed to the decline in the overall value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols, with Ether-based protocols accounting for more than 90% of the total TVL. Ethereum&#8217;s Daily Active Addresses Decline In addition to the revenue decline, Ethereum&#8217;s daily active addresses experienced a notable drop of 6% during Q2 2023. The metric measures the number of unique wallet addresses that have conducted transactions on the Ether blockchain per day during the quarter. Despite the ongoing bear market, the decline in daily active addresses hasn&#8217;t worsened significantly, indicating a level of resilience in user activity.

The continuous efforts to improve the network&#8217;s usability and scalability are crucial in attracting a broader user base, as demonstrated by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s recent proposal. ETH Still King Of DeFi Despite the decline in daily users and network revenue, Ethereum has managed to maintain its spot as the leading blockchain when it comes to DeFi activity.

					<description><![CDATA[Senior House Republicans have officially introduced a bill that seeks to change how crypto markets function in the United States. Republican members of the Agriculture and Financial Services Committees of the United States House have introduced this bill to create a regulatory framework for digital assets. Submitted on July 20, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act represents an effort by US lawmakers to promote collaboration between two major federal regulators. These include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 212-page bill aims to tackle regulatory gaps by establishing a comprehensive framework. The framework is expected to address the specific risks associated with various digital asset-related activities. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong With 19% Rally – More Gains In The Pipeline? Crypto Regulation Framework: Protecting Consumers And Fostering Innovation The bill has been co-submitted by Glenn Thompson, Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, and French Hill, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets. It primarily aims to safeguard consumers and promote innovation within the United States. In addition to its consumer protection and innovation promotion goals, the bill also establishes criteria for classifying a digital asset as a commodity. The primary focus lies on decentralization. If a digital asset meets these conditions, it becomes eligible to be traded as a digital asset commodity on SEC-registered digital asset trading systems. As part of this regulatory framework, market participants would be required to adhere to enhanced and comprehensive disclosure standards. Furthermore, these participants may need to register with both relevant regulatory agencies for compliance purposes. The bill specifically outlines a streamlined process for crypto companies to register with two key financial regulators, the CFTC and the SEC. The bill also seeks to modernize and update the outdated US securities laws when it comes to crypto. One significant amendment proposed in the bill is requiring the SEC to take into consideration the aspect of &#8220;innovation&#8221; as it is imperative to consider innovation when making regulatory decisions or taking any enforcement actions. The bill stated: Securities laws and regulations do not account for many of the unique characteristics of digital assets. Focus On Integrating NFTs In Traditional Marketplaces Under the provisions of the crypto regulation bill, both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would be obligated to collaborate with foreign regulators. The objective is to establish uniform and consistent regulatory standards for digital assets and related activities across international jurisdictions. This collaboration aims to reduce regulatory discrepancies. It also focuses on enhancing global cooperation and creating a more harmonized approach to governing the digital asset space. Additionally, the bill mandates the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a comprehensive study on nonfungible tokens (NFTs). It also urges GAO to integrate NFTs within traditional marketplaces. This study will delve into various aspects of NFTs. This includes a study on their functioning, impact on markets, potential risks, and possible implications for consumers and investors. Related Reading: Is The Chainlink Top In?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior House Republicans have officially introduced a <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fit_for_the_21st_century_act_of_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bill</a> that seeks to change how crypto markets function in the United States. Republican members of the Agriculture and Financial Services Committees of the United States House have introduced this bill to create a regulatory framework for digital assets.</p>
<p>Submitted on July 20, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act represents an effort by US lawmakers to promote collaboration between two major federal regulators. These include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>The 212-page bill aims to tackle regulatory gaps by establishing a comprehensive framework. The framework is expected to address the specific risks associated with various digital asset-related activities.</p>

<h2>Crypto Regulation Framework: Protecting Consumers And Fostering Innovation</h2>
<p>The bill has been co-submitted by Glenn Thompson, Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, and French Hill, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets. It primarily aims to safeguard consumers and promote innovation within the United States.</p>
<p>In addition to its consumer protection and innovation promotion goals, the bill also establishes criteria for classifying a digital asset as a commodity. The primary focus lies on decentralization.</p>
<p>If a digital asset meets these conditions, it becomes eligible to be traded as a digital asset commodity on SEC-registered digital asset trading systems. As part of this regulatory framework, market participants would be required to adhere to enhanced and comprehensive disclosure standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these participants may need to register with both relevant regulatory agencies for compliance purposes. The bill specifically outlines a streamlined process for crypto companies to register with two key financial regulators, the CFTC and the SEC.</p>
<p>The bill also seeks to modernize and update the outdated US securities laws when it comes to crypto. One significant amendment proposed in the bill is requiring the SEC to take into consideration the aspect of &#8220;innovation&#8221; as it is imperative to consider innovation when making regulatory decisions or taking any enforcement actions.</p>
<p>The bill stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Securities laws and regulations do not account for many of the unique characteristics of digital assets.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[The comeback of the Stellar Lumens (XLM) price keeps going on. In the last 24 hours, XLM has risen by another 15%, bringing the Ripple competitor&#8217;s price in line with XRP. Indeed, both tokens have risen by close to 65% (at this stage) since the summary judgment in Ripple&#8217;s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Remarkably, the relationship between Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Ripple&#8217;s XRP has been an intriguing tale of correlation and decoupling. As the market reacted to the recent developments in the Ripple-SEC battle, XLM followed suit, experiencing a remarkable price surge. However, as the broader market conditions cast their shadows, the question arises: Can Stellar Lumens maintain its newfound independence and continue its upward trajectory? The Correlation Between XLM and XRP It is no secret that Stellar Lumens and Ripple&#8217;s XRP share many similarities in their blockchain technologies and use cases. Moreover, the founder&#8217;s Jed McCaleb’s connection to Ripple adds another layer of intrigue, as investors hope that XLM will not be deemed a security by regulators. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Surges Over 43% In One Week, What’s Pushing It? This connection has often resulted in XLM mirroring the price movements of XRP. The market&#8217;s anticipation of developments for Ripple being equally impactful for Stellar has often led to such correlated movements, just like last week after the Ripple ruling. However, in recent days, Stellar Lumens has managed to stand on its own feet, showcasing its ability to decouple from the fortunes of XRP. One factor for this may have been its partnership with MoneyGram, which yielded the innovative B2B service called MoneyGram Access. This service enables the conversion of the stablecoin USDC into cash worldwide through MoneyGram&#8217;s branch network, tapping into Stellar&#8217;s ledger for seamless execution. This strategic collaboration has not only bolstered Stellar&#8217;s use case but also may catalyzed its recent surge in price. Related Reading: Stellar Makes Surprise 70% Rally – Start Of Something Big For XLM? With the integration of Access into various applications and fiat ramps, XLM&#8217;s demand and utility is substantially boosted. For instance, the HoneyCoin app&#8217;s integration of Access for straightforward cash out in multiple African countries and the United Kingdom might have contributed to Stellar&#8217;s outperformance relative to XRP in recent days. We&#8217;re excited to share @honeycoinapp users can now cash out of their USDC balance at supported @MoneyGram locations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana, and the UK 🥳️ Another real-world use case for @Circle’s USDC on Stellar.https://t.co/0JKNhdJMx3 — Stellar (@StellarOrg) July 17, 2023 A second factor for XLM’s recently strong performance could be the extremely high interest on the futures market. The open interest for Stellar Lumens has skyrocketed to over $120 million yesterday, a level not seen since the peak of the bull market in November 2021. Notably, this phenomenon is similar to XRP which has also seen open interest soar to prior record levels. Stellar Lumens Price Outlook Despite experiencing a sharp rally, Stellar Lumens still remains in rather bearish territory when looking at the 1-week chart. For this week, it’s crucial that the XLM price regains the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0,1583 as well as the 200-week EMA at $0,1597 (blue line). With the weekly RSI at 73, another leg up could be possible. On the 1-day time frame, XLM remains above all moving averages (EMAs). For a further bullish trajectory, it&#8217;s important that Stellar hold above the support at $0.1250. Should this happen, XLM could experience a further 35% rally towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. However, a drop below the support level at $0.1250 would challenge the bullish view.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market swiftly turned bearish from yesterday&#8217;s scarcely bullish outlook, and top coins have receded farther from their new-found support. But interestingly, MarkerDao’s MKR appears unperturbed by the market’s gloomy sentiment as MKR soared higher with massive gains, adding over 17% to its value on the day.  MKR Price Outlook Over the last day, the MRK token has witnessed several steep rise and fall. The digital asset reached a day-high of $1,203 at 2:30 am UTC on July 21, a 20% increase from its July 20 opening price. Related Reading: Best Bitcoin Roulette Sites And Crypto Roulette Games MKR had lost momentum shortly after the $1,203 peak spike, falling to $1,134. However, it continued the fluctuations before regaining momentum for a more bullish rise. At the time of writing, Maker&#8217;s price is changing hands at $1,162, with a 17.63% 24-hour price increase.  Maker’s current price is 26% higher than its value seven days ago and it may surpass $1,200 if it sustains the current bullish rally. A close look at MKR’s sudden price resurgence suggests the token might be riding on some other bullish waves. Possible Reasons Behind Maker’s Sudden Price Surge Maker&#8217;s dramatic price surge may be due to recent developments in the MakerDAO ecosystem. On-chain sleuth, Lookonchain, reported some conspicuous activities by top VC firms Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z and CMS Holdings, which are suspected to be responsible for the price surge. According to the report, a16z recently deposited large chunks of Maker tokens to Coinbase. The venture capital company deposited 12,864 MKR tokens worth approximately $12.6 million at the time.  The firm also reportedly transferred another 6,900 MKR, worth $8 million by today’s exchange rates, to a new address, presumably with plans to deposit the funds on an exchange. Currently, a16z holds around 12,396 MKR tokens worth ~$14.4 million. Also, Lookonchain reported that CMS, a blockchain-focused private investment company, reduced its recently acquired MKR holdings. CMS Holdings deposited 525 MKR tokens worth $614,000 to Binance two hours before the sharp price surge. CMS previously withdrew 1,325 Maker tokens worth $1.54 million from Binance and Bitget at an average price of $793. The investment firm now holds 800 MKR, worth approximately $936,000. Implications Of a16z And CMS Holding’s Activities The unprecedented change in the token holdings of these top market players must have significantly contributed to the token&#8217;s price spike. The market positively reacted to the massive MKR sales, leading to increased trading volume and price surge. The sharp spike in MKR’s price can be interpreted this way: the trading activity of institutional investors like a16z and CMS Holdings draws more attention to Maker. The renewed interest could bring new buyers, exerting more demand pressure on the token and causing the price to spike further. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075 However, the firms&#8217; Maker holdings reduction may raise questions about the token&#8217;s long-term value. This potentially bodes badly for MKR as it could depress investor sentiment, causing massive selloffs which might push the price down.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Chainlink&#8217;s social dominance has observed a large spike after its sharp price surge, a possible sign that the top may be here. Chainlink Social Dominance Rises To 3rd Largest In Cryptocurrency Sector According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, LINK is the third most trending asset in the market right now. The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;social dominance,&#8221; to understand which another metric needs to be looked at first: the social volume. The social volume measures the total amount of social media text documents (that is, text-based posts, threads, messages, etc.) that are making mentions of a given asset (which, in the current case, is Chainlink). This metric basically provides us with information about the degree of discussion that a particular coin is receiving across major social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and 4chan. Now, the aforementioned social dominance is a metric that compares the social volume of a cryptocurrency, with combined that of the top 100 assets by market cap in the space. Naturally, in the case of LINK, this indicator tells us how much talk related to the top coins in the market is coming from discussions centered on Chainlink alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Crucial Retest: Which Of These Historical Patterns Will Repeat? Here is a chart that shows the trend in the LINK social dominance over the past month: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, Chainlink&#8217;s social dominance has registered a large spike following the rapid growth in the price of the cryptocurrency during the last couple of days. At the peak of this latest sharp surge, the asset&#8217;s value had climbed above the $8.4 mark, but since then the cryptocurrency has gone down a bit. Nonetheless, the price is still floating above $8.1 and the coin&#8217;s gains stand at an impressive 19%. Historically, rallies like these have attracted a lot of eyes to LINK, so it&#8217;s not particularly surprising that the cryptocurrency&#8217;s share of discussions in the sector has shot up. The scale of this rise, though, may be a slightly worrying sign. Chainlink is the third most talked about asset in the market right now, despite being only the 20th largest in terms of market cap.

Given that the latest discussions have come just after the rally, it would appear likely that these talks are in fact a sign of hype in the market. Such amount of hype has often proved to be a bearish signal for Chainlink, as tops become more likely to form in this kind of market environment. If a similar pattern follows now as well, then it may mean that the current social dominance spike is a sign that a local top is already in for the cryptocurrency.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana, a key player in the Layer-1 blockchain network domain, has shown a substantial improvement in the network&#8217;s uptime and reliability this year, with just one recorded outage so far since the year 2023 began. According to a performance report released by the Solana Foundation on July 20, the network&#8217;s stability and performance saw a significant uptick in the first half of 2023. The report presents detailed metrics including the network&#8217;s uptime and the ratio of non-voting to voting transactions, which are key indicators of network efficiency and reliability. Addressing The Network Reliability Challenge Despite its promising features, Solana has historically faced issues relating to network uptime and reliability. These problems, referred to as a &#8220;curse&#8221; by Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, were largely attributed to the network&#8217;s low-cost transactions, which according to Yakovenko frequently led to Solana network outages. Related Reading: Solana Shining Moment: What To Expect After SOL Crossed $20 1/ The Solana Foundation has released the most recent @Solana Network Performance report. The Solana network’s performance has improved through H1 2023, as measured by uptime, the ratio of non-voting-to-voting transactions, &#38; more. Read the full report: https://t.co/naOftyknLA pic.twitter.com/yI9Q8swWdT — Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) July 20, 2023 However, the latest report offers a refreshing contrast to this history, marking a 100% uptime since February 25. This performance ensures that Solana completed an entire quarter without any outages, with the only disruption of the year in February causing a nearly 19-hour network blackout. Indicators Of Network Efficiency In addition to its uptime record, Solana is also making strides in the ratio of voting to non-voting transactions. To clarify, voting transactions are carried out when a validator, a crucial component of the blockchain ecosystem, gets involved in validating and approving one or more proposed data blocks on the network. On the other hand, non-voting transactions are those instigated by user activities on the blockchain, which could include actions such as sending or receiving tokens, executing smart contracts, or interacting with decentralized applications (DApps). The Solana Foundation report also predicts a decreasing these voting-to-non-voting transaction ratios over time, as increased network efficiency should result in a lower overall percentage of voting transactions. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Smashes Key Resistance, $22 Could Be Next Furthermore, Solana’s throughput, measured in terms of transactions per second (TPS), is another vital indicator of network efficiency. The report reveals that Solana&#8217;s maximum daily TPS has been on an upward trajectory since January, a trend closely associated with new network upgrades. According to data from Dune Analytics, the transaction rate on the Solana network currently stands at 3,781 transactions per second. Meanwhile, the network&#8217;s native token SOL has been in a bearish trend in the past week.  Particularly, SOL has plunged by more than 10% in the past 7 days. The asset has dropped from a high of trading above $30 last Friday following a quick spike to a low of $25.39 at the time of writing, down by roughly 6.6% in the past 24 hours.
