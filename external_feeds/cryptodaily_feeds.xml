			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coca-Cola has launched its new exclusive NFT collection on Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network during the &ldquo;Onchain Summer&rdquo; festival.</p>
Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Masterpiece Campaign
<p>On Sunday, August 13, one of the most recognizable consumer brands in the world, Coca-Cola, revealed its new non-fungible tokens (NFT) collection on Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 blockchain called &ldquo;Base&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The collection is a part of Coca-Cola's global &ldquo;Masterpiece&rdquo; campaign which was partially created by the brand&rsquo;s AI platform known as &ldquo;Real Magic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Masterpiece&rsquo; is not a story in which Coke appears&hellip; Coke is the story,&rdquo; commented Pratik Thakar, Global Head of Creative Strategy and Integrated Content for Coca‑Cola. &ldquo;True to the spirit of the brand&mdash;and not unlike the way a synchronized supply chain collaborates to seamlessly deliver ice-cold Coca‑Cola to consumers at just the right time&mdash;a diverse collection of artwork spanning multiple genres, geographies and generations comes together to uplift a slumping teenager. Creating human connection and bringing enchantment to everyday moments is what &lsquo;Real Magic&rsquo; is all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Masterpiece NFT collection showcases the artwork featured in the brand&rsquo;s campaign, including Andy Warhol&rsquo;s iconic 1962 Coca‑Cola painting, classical pieces of timeless artists such as Edvard Munch&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Scream&rdquo; and Johannes Vermeer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Girl with a Pearl Earring,&rdquo;, as well as works of emerging artists such as Aket, Fatma Ramadan, and Vikram Kushwah.</p>
Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer
<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s new NFT collection has been offered for a limited time and presented as a part of the Coinbase&rsquo;s Onchain Summer event:</p>

<p>&ldquo;@CocaCola is bringing their Global Masterpiece campaign onchain with iconic works from leading artists,&rdquo; Coinbase announced on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>Onchain Summer is Coinbase's month-long celebration of its Layer-2 Blochcian Base which became available to the general public on August 9. Each day, the festival offers numerous onchain mints, stories, and activities related to art, culture, music, gaming, and more. Coca-Cola is undoubtedly the most recognizable brand presented on the list of Base&rsquo;s partners so far.</p>
Coca-Cola and NFTs
<p>This is not the first time the world-renowned soft drinks brand has ventured into the NFT space. Back in 2021, Coca-Cola auctioned off exclusive NFT collectibles with the aim of raising funds for Special Olympics International. At that time, the first Coca-Cola&rsquo;s NFT loot box was sold as a single asset for over $575,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s engagement with NFTs is meaningful for the whole cryptocurrency industry. As one of the largest global consumer brands, Coca-Cola could introduce many of its customers to the world of digital art and Web3. Besides, the beverage giant will likely play a big role in promoting Coinbase&rsquo;s Layer-2 network Base.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Former United States President Donald Trump&rsquo;s latest public financial disclosure has revealed that he owns around $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump had recently launched an exclusive non-fungible token (NFT) collection after leaving the White House in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
Trump Holds Considerable ETH&nbsp;
<p>The financial disclosure was filed with the Office of Government Ethics and outlined Trump&rsquo;s various assets and sources of income. Eagle-eyed observers noticed a section that mentioned a &ldquo;cryptocurrency wallet Ethereum&rdquo; on the second to last entry on the 82-page form. According to the information in the financial disclosure, the wallet held an estimated $250,000 to $500,000 worth of ETH. It is believed that the contents of the cryptocurrency wallet are linked with the NFT collection launched by Trump in December 2022.&nbsp;</p>
The Trump NFTs&nbsp;
<p>The former president launched his NFT collection in December 2022 after weeks of speculation regarding his &ldquo;special announcement.&rdquo; Many believed the announcement would be naming a running mate for his presidential campaign. However, Mr. Trump announced the launch of his exclusive NFT collection instead. The collection features the former president in several avatars, including a Nascar driver and an astronaut. At the time of the launch, Mr Trump had stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career. It would make a great Christmas gift. Don&rsquo;t Wait. They will be gone; I believe, very quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had also posted a clip that featured an animated version of himself standing in front of the Trump Tower, with lasers shooting out of his eyes. The NFT collection was described as similar to baseball cards but far more exciting and priced at $99 each. Buyers of the collection will also be able to enter a sweepstake and have a chance at winning a gala dinner or a game of golf with Mr. Trump. However, the move was roundly criticized on social media, with several high-profile Republicans speaking out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following her husband&rsquo;s footsteps, the former first lady also launched an NFT collection only a couple of months after the former president&rsquo;s NFT collection. Each NFT in the Melania Trump collection is priced at $50. The collection consisted of seven designs, with a total of 3500 NFTs. The former first lady had stated at the time of launch,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 1776 Collection of artwork draws inspiration from several iconic landmarks of our nation, which I had the privilege of visiting during the time I served as first lady. Each piece provides a view into our nation&rsquo;s history, culture, and patriotism. I am proud to celebrate our great nation and remain inspired by the words contained within the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p>

Past Skepticism Of Crypto&nbsp;
<p>The disclosure that the former president owns a considerable amount of ETH is interesting, especially when you consider how skeptical he had been about crypto in the past. Back in 2019, Trump had stated that he was not a fan of Bitcoin and described it as &ldquo;not money&rdquo; with its valuation based on thin air.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trump reiterated these views in a 2021 interview, once again highlighting his opposition to the crypto ecosystem and digital assets. He stated that he was quite wary of digital assets such as Bitcoin because they were a threat to the dollar. He even called the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency a scam, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin just seems like a scam&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like it because it is another currency competing against the dollar. Essentially it&rsquo;s a currency competing against the dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That is what I have always said.&rdquo;</p>

Back in 2019, Trump had stated that he was not a fan of Bitcoin and described it as &ldquo;not money&rdquo; with its valuation based on thin air.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trump reiterated these views in a 2021 interview, once again highlighting his opposition to the crypto ecosystem and digital assets. He stated that he was quite wary of digital assets such as Bitcoin because they were a threat to the dollar. He even called the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency a scam, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin just seems like a scam&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like it because it is another currency competing against the dollar. Essentially it&rsquo;s a currency competing against the dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That is what I have always said.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Volatility Favoring Downside:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 15 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) experienced elevated downside risk early in the Asian session as the pair depreciated to the 29072.96 area after selling pressure expanded around the 29447.60 area, representing another failed test of the 76.4% retracement of the depreciating range from 30350.70 to 26501.59.&nbsp;&nbsp; This interday high also represented a test of the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 28660.53 to 30222, while the move to multi-session lows around the 29072 area represented a test of the 76.4% retracement of the same appreciating. &nbsp;Technical trading was recently evident when buying pressure strengthened around the 28754 area, a previous downside price objective associated with selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 areas.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29347.27 and the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29346.47.</p>

<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Prominent decentralized exchange Uniswap has confirmed that it has fired a prominent developer over his involvement in a $25,000 memecoin rug pull.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developer in question, AzFlin, or Allen Lin, orchestrated a rug pull hours after initiating the deployment of the FrensTech meme coin.&nbsp;</p>
Uniswap Moves To Fire AzFlin
<p>Allen Lin, the Uniswap developer at the center of the storm surrounding the FrensTech meme coin rug pull, has lost his job at Uniswap. The sacking was confirmed in a post on X by Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, with Uniswap moving quickly to distance themselves from the actions of their former employee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wanted to let people know this person is no longer with the company. Not behavior we support or condone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>AzFlin lost his job at the decentralized exchange following the FrensTech meme coin rug pull that saw investors lose 14 ETH, valued at around $25,900. The meme coin was launched on the social platform of the Coinbase Layer-2 base program, friend.tech.&nbsp;</p>
How The Rug Pull Was Orchestrated&nbsp;
<p>A pseudo-anonymous user on X going by the name UniswapVillain initially made the Uniswap community aware of the fact that AzFlin had rug-pulled a meme coin project just hours after creating it. UniswapVillain noted that AzFlin initiated the rug pull by withdrawing support that was previously added to enable the trading of the FRENs token. Once the project had accumulated 14 ETH in fees, AzFlin removed liquidity and pocketed all the funds collected by the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rug pull was orchestrated via the Hop Protocol, a decentralized bridge that allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchains. Furthermore, UniswapVillain added that the developer did not just remove liquidity from the project and meme coin. He also sold all the coins from which he had withdrawn the liquidity. He also added that the situation was particularly concerning, given AzFlin&rsquo;s association with Uniswap, one of the most prominent decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frenstech (@FrensTech) $FRENS was deployed a few hours ago by the dev, @AzFlina Uniswap employee. One hour and four minutes ago, he effectively rugged the project, moving 14 ETH off of Base chain through HOP. Multiple people have confirmed he is the dev, and there were numerous early Uniswap employee followers on Twitter. He removed liquidity he added from fees and pocketed 14 ETH of fees. He sold the tokens he removed from liquidity even. This is wild to me that someone who is doxxed and works for Uniswap would do this.&rdquo;</p>

AzFlin Calls Sacking Net Neutral&nbsp;
<p>An unremorseful AzFlin called his sacking &ldquo;net neutral,&rdquo; boasting that he had gained 600 new followers and the status of a crypto villain on X. While people have wondered why someone who is doxxed and works for Uniswap would do this, AzFlin has remained unrepentant. The bad actor simply gave an update about losing their job on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got fired from UniSwap but gained new followers and Crypto Twitter villain status.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He also changed his bio on X, adding the words AzFlin &ldquo;Unemployment arc&rdquo; and further commented on the issue:</p>

<p>"To those who think I rugged 14E: that came from dev taxes. It belonged to me. I know whatever I say, the low IQ CT narrative has already been spun. I will not comment further on this anymore, everything is on chain.&rdquo;</p>

The Growing Menace Of Rug Pulls&nbsp;
<p>Rug pulls have become increasingly common in the crypto space in recent times, primarily impacting newer tokens and decentralized exchanges. This comes against the backdrop of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum making record price moments that are not actionable, leaving investors desperate for a hefty profit. This is why traders should not buy into the hype of new projects and tokens pushed by influencers. Instead, they must do their own research and invest in reputable projects.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore-based Web 3 gaming firm Affyn is set to participate in the annual Grand Prix Season Singapore (GPSS), a 10-day event supported by the Singapore Tourism Board that culminates during the&nbsp; Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix weekend. According to the team statement, Affyn entered a strategic partnership with GPSS to present a metaverse event to the fans of the Grand Prix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;"We are proud to partner with GPSS as it underlines Affyn&rsquo;s intent to bolster Government initiatives and bring Web 3.0 development to the next level,&rdquo; said Affyn CEO Lucaz Lee. &ldquo;As the only official Web 3.0 company partnering with GPSS, an event supported by STB, it is an incredible opportunity to drive awareness of developments in the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event, titled &lsquo;Web 3.0 | Art Meets Metaverse&rsquo;,&nbsp; is set to run on Saturday, 16th September 2023, at Suntec City&rsquo;s Synthesis from 1 PM to 4 PM (local time). The event will include NFT exhibitions from artists around Singapore, a celebrity-hosted panel talk show and experiential zones that allow guests to delve into the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Singapore rising as a crypto hub in the East, the involvement of crypto in such a global sporting event blends well in maintaining its verve as the leading crypto hub in Asia. The event aims to educate non-crypto fans on the developments of the metaverse in the art world, dive into discussions on the state of the metaverse industry, interact during the exhibition and learn from experts via their talk shows. In addition, attendees can interact and share with other enthusiasts and dive into how blockchain and the metaverse affect art in the real world today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other news, Affyn-based gaming title Nexus World Land City will be launching its third wave of land parcels starting August 23.&nbsp; Players will have the chance to claim their land parcels in eight cities, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Manilla, Sydney, and Zurich.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto companies&rsquo; relationship with F1 extends
<p>Despite the recent departures of FTX and Tezos, who sponsored the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team and Scuderia AlphaTauri, respectively, crypto partnerships with F1 teams have grown, as evidenced by Affyn&rsquo;s Singapore GP event. Earlier this year, British F1 team Williams Racing entered a strategic partnership with Kraken Exchange to launch a competition to see NFTs showcased around this year's Singapore GP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other crypto partners in F1 include Bybit, sponsoring Redbull Racing Team in a $150 million deal and Stake.com, an Alfa Romeo Formula One Team sponsor.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance platform Zunami Protocol has become the latest protocol to be hacked after confirming on Sunday that bad actors hacked its liquidity pool on Curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exploit led to the protocol losing over $2.1 million, according to estimates from blockchain security firm PeckShield and Ironblocks.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>The protocol confirmed the hack on Sunday, with security firm PeckShield confirming it as well. The protocol advised users to refrain from purchasing any of its Zunami Ether (zETH) or Zunami USD (UZD) stablecoins following the attack. The protocol further added that collateral remained secure and it was investigating the cause of the exploit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears that zStables have encountered an attack. The collateral remain secure, we delve into the ongoing investigation. Please do not buy zETH and UZD at the moment; their emission has been attacked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield, in an analysis of the attack, estimated that around $2.1 million was stolen from the decentralized finance protocol&rsquo;s Curve pool and put the exploit down to a price manipulation issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi @ZunamiProtocol Today&rsquo;s hack leads to &gt;$2.1m loss, and there are two hack txs involved: - tx1:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2aec4fdb2a09ad4269a410f2c770737626fb62c54e0fa8ac25e8582d4b690cca - tx2:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0788ba222970c7c68a738b0e08fb197e669e61f9b226ceec4cab9b85abe8cceb It is a price manipulation issue, which can be exploited by donation to incorrectly calculate the price as shown in the following figures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fellow security firm Ironblocks also conducted an analysis of the hack, coming to the same conclusion as PeckShield regarding the cause of the hack. In its analysis, Ironblocks explained,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attacker took [a] flash loan from [the] balancer, then he added liquidity so he [would] be able to change the price significantly and started to trade in Zunami&rsquo;s exchange. Then he removed the liquidity and changed the price, then he traded back and [returned] the flash loan and got 1,152 ETH to himself. Classic price manipulation.&rdquo;</p>

Price Of Zunami USD And Zunami ETH Collapses&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The price of both the Zunami USD stablecoin and Zunami ETH (zETH) fell off a cliff following the exploit. The stablecoin lost its entire value, dropping 99%, while zETH dropped over 88%, dropping to $206. PeckShield also confirmed that the stolen funds had already been put through the controversial coin mixer Tornado Cash.&nbsp;</p>
Curve&rsquo;s Recent Troubles&nbsp;
<p>The Zunami protocol is a yield farming aggregator for stablecoins and maintains its primary zStable pools on Curve. The protocol is managed as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and promises users the &ldquo;highest API on the market.&rdquo; It has also stated that it has over $5 million in total value locked (TVL) on its website. According to Zunami, users can use the protocol to diversify their stablecoin portfolio and avoid the risk of crashing one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve Finance has faced multiple attacks over the past few weeks, impacting multiple decentralized finance protocols. Attackers managed to steal over $24 million worth of crypto by leveraging a vulnerability in the liquidity pools on Curve. The vulnerability was eventually traced back to Vyper, a third-party programming language being used to program Ethereum smart contracts on the protocol. At the time, Curve stated that liquidity pools not using Vyper were not impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A number of stablepools (alETH/msETH/pETH) using Vyper 0.2.15 have been exploited as a result of a malfunctioning reentrancy lock. We are assessing the situation and will update the community as things develop. Other pools are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exploit put major protocols at risk, especially due to Curve founder Michael Egorov&rsquo;s $168 million lending position, which was at risk of liquidation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Visa recently completed a test that allows users to pay Ethereum (ETH) gas fees through credit and debit cards. </p>
<p>Global payment giant Visa has successfully completed a test for an innovative solution on the Ethereum blockchain, which will allow its users to pay on-chain gas fees using a Visa debit or credit card.</p>
<p>The test was revealed by Mustafa Bedawala, a Visa product manager, to address the ongoing challenge of ensuring Ether balances for covering gas fees.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're excited to share our experimental solution on Paying Onchain Gas Fees with a Visa Card At @Visa, we've been exploring ways to simplify blockchain transactionsImagine paying for gas fees as easily as buying coffee with your card! But how did we get here?🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/uGhAde60xe</p>
&mdash; Mustafa (@digitalmustafa) August 10, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The possible solution aims to improve the interaction process with dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. Visa said the trial &ldquo;helps set the stage for a more accessible and user-friendly approach to digital transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visa said:</p>

<p>"To transact using a blockchain like Ethereum, consumers must maintain a balance of the blockchain&rsquo;s native token (e.g., ETH) to pay fees for using the network, known as &ldquo;gas.&rdquo; What if sending blockchain transactions using self-custodial wallets was as straightforward for the user as using your card to pay for a cup of coffee?"</p>

Visa Aims to Eliminate Overspending ETH
<p>The standard Ethereum transaction requires users acquiring ETH from an exchange wanting to transfer it to their wallets to pay variable gas fees. The variable gas fees often result in users spending more ETH than necessary or having insufficient ETH.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, Visa&rsquo;s solution uses Ethereum&rsquo;s ERC-4337 standards and the &ldquo;Paymaster&rdquo; smart contract allowing off-chain gas fee payments. Users trigger an Ethereum transaction through their wallets which is then sent to the paymaster. Paymaster calculates the gas fee and charges Visa through a service called Cybersource.</p>
<p>A digital signature is produced and validated for a limited time, then attached by the wallet before sending it to the blockchain. The signature is verified, and Paymaster settles the gas fees. Visa&rsquo;s innovative solution thereby allows users to pay gas fees off-chain with their Visa card and eliminates the need for users to hold ETH to pay for gas fees.</p>
<p>Visa explained that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The intricacies and complexities of blockchain-based transactions have been a significant stumbling block for many users, creating a challenging learning curve and increasing user friction.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visa&rsquo;s research team added that the solution offers a &ldquo;promising approach to substantially addressing these challenges.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>There are gems of tokens that have been overshadowed by bigger, well-established tokens. However, we'll be highlighting some of these lesser-known tokens that have shown significant growth potential. They include Nexo (NEXO), Pomerdoge (POMD), and 1inch (1INCH) tokens.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Key Cryptocurrencies To Watch Closely &ndash; 1inch (1INCH), Nexo(NEXO), and Pomerdoge (POMD)
<p>The once bearish trend experienced by the 1inch (1NCH) token has flattened and it is looking set to go on a bullish rally. This is evident in the stats that show that it has seen a slight move towards a positive price action after suffering a 2.45% loss in price value in the last 7 days. 1INCH currently trades at $0.30 with a 24-hour trading volume of $14 million.</p>
<p>After falling to an all-time low of $0.25 on June 15, 2023, 1inch is bouncing back at the moment, with the coin gaining 3% in the last 30 days. Crypto price prediction platforms have projected that 1inch could exceed the $0.5 benchmark very soon.</p>
<p>Right now, analysts reckon that 1 inch is on the right track to surge in the coming days and weeks.</p>
Investors Confident in the Resurgence of Nexo (NEXO) Despite Current Dip in Price
<p>Notwithstanding the ongoing declining price action of the Nexo (NEXO) token, investors and analysts are confident that the token will rally anytime soon. For context, It has lost 1.93% in price value in the last 24 hours and trades at $0.63 as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>However, the trading volume of Nexo in the last 24 hours shows that the market activity of the token gained 8.88% to see a market return of over $1.90M.</p>
<p>A further look at the price chart shows that Nexo is 3.69% better off in price value than it was in the last 30 days and has only lost 0.58% of its price value in the last 7 days. As such, Nexo may well be a shrewd investment option.</p>
<p>Most crypto price prediction platforms already predicted that Nexo will hit the $1 benchmark in the year. If the coin breaks the current resistance level, we could witness a rally very soon.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Surges As More Investors Buy Into the Presale
<p>Pomerdoge (POMD) has been consistently on an upward trajectory since its presale phase started. Pomerdoge is a P2E gaming platform where individuals from around the globe can connect and network with each other while engaging in healthy digital gaming competitions.</p>
<p>Currently, Pomerdoge is rewarding presale investors with the chance to exclusively own part of the 7,777 NFTs that'll be minted on the platform. Moreso, presale investors will earn a percentage of the revenue generated from the Pomergame platform - a platform under the Pomerdoge ecosystem.</p>
<p>The revenue will be distributed based on the number of POMD tokens users have in their accounts. Anyone can become a presale investor and enjoy these benefits. All you have to do is buy the Pomerdoge tokens now at the price of only $0.008.</p>
<p>The Pomerdoge project has been vetted by SolidProof and Cyberscope. The token's liquidity will be locked for life as a security measure for investors' assets. There are concrete reasons to believe in the promising investment opportunity presented by Pomerdoge.</p>

<p>However, the trading volume of Nexo in the last 24 hours shows that the market activity of the token gained 8.88% to see a market return of over $1.90M.</p>
<p>A further look at the price chart shows that Nexo is 3.69% better off in price value than it was in the last 30 days and has only lost 0.58% of its price value in the last 7 days. As such, Nexo may well be a shrewd investment option.</p>
<p>Most crypto price prediction platforms already predicted that Nexo will hit the $1 benchmark in the year. If the coin breaks the current resistance level, we could witness a rally very soon.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In spite of the IMF obliging the Argentine central bank to say it wouldn&rsquo;t entertain Bitcoin, the next potential president is very much pro the king of the cryptocurrencies.</p>
IMF should be concerned
<p>When the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forced the Argentine central bank to guarantee that it wouldn&rsquo;t dabble in bitcoin, on pain of having its last crucial loan denied, the global financial agency must have thought that it had stopped bitcoin from being used in at least one Latin American country.</p>
<p>A short time later, and the IMF must be feeling more than a trifle worried as a libertarian pro-Bitcoin candidate looks to be about to win the country&rsquo;s presidential primary elections with more than 90% of the vote already counted.</p>
Central bank is a scam
<p>Javier Milei, young leader of La Libertad Avanza party, is not a meek and mild libertarian either. He is openly campaigning to abolish the Argentine central bank, calling it a &ldquo;scam&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a statement is inflammatory in the extreme and will probably be taken by many from the Argentine elites and the banking sector as the rantings of a revolutionary hot head.</p>
<p>However, the presidential hopeful has shown in interviews that he understands how money works, and he is calling out politicians and the central bank for cheating people with an &ldquo;inflationary tax&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Milei had the following to say in an interview:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem is that governments are not going to want to give up compulsory use of fiat currency. Bitcoin is the natural reaction to central bank fraud, but allowing money to become private once more isn&rsquo;t something the thieving politicians will allow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In past times, such language used by an aspiring politician, let alone one that would be president of his country, would have been denounced by the ruling class and would have been enough to see that this person got nowhere near any position of power.</p>
Argentina running out of options
<p>However, this is Argentina, a country that has played the IMF game for many decades, with presidents and top bank officials doing exactly as they were told, only for Argentina to lurch from one default crisis to another, over and over again, with citizens' purchasing power in the Argentine peso practically going to zero, and with an annual inflation rate of well over 100%.</p>
<p>For Argentina to move onto the sound money base that is Bitcoin, could be a very interesting move for the country. That the elites in Argentina, plus the powers that be across the globe, might allow such a decision is something else.</p>
<p>Argentina is in an extremely precarious financial position, and has only just managed to avoid default just recently with the help of China and the Latin American Development Bank. It will take a very brave and resolute leader to oversee such an incredible transition. For Argentina, there may be no other option.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons has just signalled again. Is this yet another infallible buy signal for this indicator?</p>
Price action about to change?
<p>All quiet on the Bitcoin front as the apex cryptocurrency continues to follow a meandering, slightly boring and predictable sideways trajectory between the $29,000 to $30,000 range.</p>
<p>However, momentum is perhaps just starting to bubble up underneath Bitcoin&rsquo;s wanderings as one of the most successful and trusted indicators has suddenly sprung into life - flashing a buy signal that was last seen at the beginning of the year, after which Bitcoin started to thrust its way out of the last bear market.</p>
The Bitcoin hash rate
<p>The Bitcoin hash rate is the amount of computing power that Bitcoin miners contribute to the network. The hash rate goes up when more miners are competing for blocks. On the flip side, when the price drops, or does not go up for a long period of time, miner capitulation happens, meaning that mining is no longer profitable, and miners take their machines offline.</p>
<p>Even though the Hash Ribbons are a lagging indicator, on the higher time frame they are a very reliable sign that a bottom or a dip in the Bitcoin price has been reached.</p>
<p>Given that Bitcoin is at a rather crucial point in what is seen by some as just a bear market rally, and by others as the initial phase of the new bull market, this signal will perhaps tip the argument more in the favour of the latter exponents.</p>
A perilous financial time
<p>A backdrop of dire economic warnings make for an incredibly interesting time for Bitcoin. The traditional monetary and banking system is on the edge of a cliff of financial oblivion, and should it go over this cliff, most financial assets might be expected to go with it.</p>
<p>There are analysts who say that Bitcoin is a risk asset, and so would be expected to be one of the first to feel the pain of a financial meltdown. However, others would say that Bitcoin was created precisely for such an extreme scenario, and given that it is outside of the traditional financial system, many investors would see it as a liferaft to which they could transfer their wealth.</p>
<p>It is certainly hoped that financial armageddon can be avoided, but given the way that governments and central banks have handled world economies, things are looking extremely perilous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be argued that the fiat currency experiment has reached the bitter end. All those still hoarding currency in the bank are doing so naively, probably unaware that their purchasing power is diminishing rapidly, and that they run the risk of being &lsquo;bailed in&rsquo; should the bank fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a sovereign store of wealth that is scarce, predictable, and the most secure computing system on the planet. Those looking to save themselves in the perilous time to come would do well to investigate Bitcoin&rsquo;s properties.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons has just signalled again. Is this yet another infallible buy signal for this indicator?</p>
Price action about to change?
<p>All quiet on the Bitcoin front as the apex cryptocurrency continues to follow a meandering, slightly boring and predictable sideways trajectory between the $29,000 to $30,000 range.</p>
<p>However, momentum is perhaps just starting to bubble up underneath Bitcoin&rsquo;s wanderings as one of the most successful and trusted indicators has suddenly sprung into life - flashing a buy signal that was last seen at the beginning of the year, after which Bitcoin started to thrust its way out of the last bear market.</p>

The App allows anyone, anywhere in the world to train AI and earn rewards.</p>&ldquo;The Workspace App is a significant leap forward in our mission to provide high quality data to companies developing AI applications,&rdquo; said Paul Lee M.D., Cofounder and CEO of Synesis One. &ldquo;We designed the Synesis One platform to connect companies that need quality AI training data with digital workers who can generate the data quickly, and at competitive prices.&rdquo;<p class="ql-align-justify">The need for high-quality data to train and refine AI models is growing at an exponential rate, as nearly every industry from financial services to health care is starting to integrate AI into their business processes. Without data, AI models are basically useless: they can't make connections or find patterns or make predictions. That&rsquo;s why humans are still needed to train AI systems.&nbsp;</p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a bit like Wikipedia,&rdquo; says Paul. &ldquo;Synesis One workers are contributing and refining data every day. But unlike Wikipedia, our contributors are paid for their contributions. That's why we call our business model Train2earn. They train AI and earn rewards.&rdquo;The applications for Synesis One are limitless. &ldquo;Train2Earn is the first enterprise-quality on-chain software where business logic is conducted entirely on blockchain,&rdquo; said Synesis One Head of Product and CTO David Saccon. &ldquo;This means the provenance of our crowdsourced data is fully traceable and auditable. We believe we are providing a critical component for a new type of open data supply chain to power AI applications.&rdquo;<p class="ql-align-justify">In addition to crypto payments, the Train2Earn platform also uses the blockchain to enable a public voting process in which contributors reach consensus about the quality of the submitted data. The result is a web3 application that is secure, decentralized, and interoperable.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Synesis One&rsquo;s first client is Mind AI, which is building an advanced natural language reasoning engine.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 29372 Objective: &nbsp;Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 14 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained confined to a very tight rangeearly in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 29372.20 area, a previous upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure around the 24750 and 26044.70areas. &nbsp; Selling pressure has recently intensifed around the 29709 and 29534 areas while buying pressure emerged around the 29213 area, underscoring the recent tight range. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical trading was recently evident when buying pressure strengthened around the 28754 area, a previous downside price objective associated with selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 areas. &nbsp;Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21. &nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas. &nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199levels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460. &nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly) and above&nbsp;the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly). &nbsp;Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 29403:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 14 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) awaited a new technical bias early in the Asian session as the pair orbited the 29403.79 area, representing a downside price objective associated with recent selling pressure around the 30421 and 29851 levels.&nbsp; Selling pressure has recently strengthened around the 29709 and 29534 areas while buying pressure emerged around the 29213 area, underscoring the recent tight range.&nbsp; Technical trading was recently evident when buying pressure strengthened around the 28754 area, a previous downside price objective associated with selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 areas.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29302.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29398.79.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Beyond its ground-breaking features, Uwerx's developers' agile methodology approach has significantly contributed to the project's success. They have been so committed to promoting Uwerx&rsquo;s vision and purpose that investors and users could completely trust them and buy into the project.</p>
<p class="s6">This was part of why the Uwerx launch was overwhelmingly successful, surpassing expectations and initial forecasts. The developers are back to work and ready to take Uwerx to the next level.</p>
<p class="s6">However, they witnessed a setback as Uwerx was attacked. The team has yet again shown commitment by quickly and efficiently developing recovery strategies and plans. This article will detail the launch, updates, the hack, and Uwerx&rsquo;s road to recovery.</p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s Successful Launch: Developers Set To Renounce Smart Contract Ownership
<p class="s6">After so much anticipation, Uwerx finally launched on August 1, 2023. The launch was successful, as everyone wanted to become a WERX holder. Also, investors and users made tons of profits with all the bonuses that were up.</p>
<p class="s6">The developers released updates on what to expect next from Uwerx as soon as the launch ended. Uwerx has finally deployed liquidity on Uniswap. The Uwerx Vault, which received positive feedback from 84% of the community, will soon be available as the smart contracts await a thorough audit. </p>
<p class="s6">To show their commitment to Uwerx&rsquo;s community, the developers immediately began the 25-year liquidity locking they promised to do once Uwerx launched. They are also ready to denounce smart contract ownership when Uwerx goes live on centralized exchanges. The team has submitted their applications to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to facilitate this. </p>
<p class="s6">The team is working to ensure the Uwerx platform is completed immediately. They are working on the core functionality design, focusing on Freelancer, Client, and Agency Dashboards, Project Management, and Additional Settings Pages. </p>
<p class="s6">Once this is finished, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with functions will be released to the community for testing. Based on the feedback obtained, they will proceed with the premium design. </p>
<p class="s6">There will be a buyback campaign that will scale accordingly to provide support for Uwerx. It will happen weekly, although the dates and times will not be released to avoid anyone taking unfair advantage of the system.</p>
Uwerx Gets Exploited
<p class="s6">On August 2, Uwerx reported it got hacked, with the hacker stealing around $327,000. The attacker flash-loaned 20,000 ETH, which he swapped for 5,053,637 WERX. He then sent 4,429,817 WERX to the Uniswap pool. This amount was ten times the prior balance.</p>
<p class="s6">Afterward, he used the skim() function of Uniswap with the address 0x00...1 as the &ldquo;to&rdquo; address. He also used the transfer function of the Uwerx contract, which first modifies a sender&rsquo;s balance. </p>
<p class="s6">Since the &ldquo;to&rdquo; address was a UniswapPoolAddress (0x00...1), an extra 1% of the initial amount was burned. As a result, there was an imbalance that the attacker took advantage of to gain 176 ETH ($327,000).</p>
Uwerx Maintains Momentum As It Sets To Relaunch
<p class="s6">Despite the hack, Uwerx continues to shine as it devises ways to tackle the hack and maintain its momentum. Once they noticed the hack, they immediately alerted SolidProof and InterFiNetwork, their auditors. Also, the team contacted PeckShieldAlert and SlowMist_Team directly on Twitter. </p>
<p class="s6">The team began by putting out a white-hat bounty, stating the attacker should return 80% of the exploited funds and keep 20%. </p>
<p class="s6">A new WERX will be relaunched, and its platform will have more robust security measures. As to the relaunch, there will be a new contract address, which will be released to the community soon. </p>
<p class="s6">However, the contract address will be audited twice by reputable companies and once by an independent contractor. Due to a change in the contract address, the Uwerx Vault smart contracts are being altered, after which they will be audited before being released to the public.</p>
<p class="s6">The new WERX will be deployed on the Polygon network instead of Uniswap, on which it is currently deployed. This will enable token holders to easily use WERX on the Uwerxplatform without having to bridge, and it will also lower gas fees. </p>
<p class="s6">However, those who bought WERX on Uniswap will not be abandoned. The team has decided to airdrop the tokens at the end of the vesting period to ensure they still benefit. They also assure those who bought WERX during the presale that they are safe and will be unaffected by the relaunch.</p>
<p class="s6">The new WERX will be deployed with more liquidity. To do this, the funds reserved for the buyback campaign will be directed to liquidity. Also, the team is proposing a no-burn tax and a sliding sell tax, of which 100% will be directed to liquidity. </p>
<p class="s6">A poll is already up on Uwerx&rsquo;s Twitter page and Telegram channel, asking the community if they support a sliding sell tax wholly directed to liquidity. Another poll also asks the community how long the vesting period should be. </p>
<p class="s6">These polls will end on August 13, after which the development of the new WERX will commence on August 14. The team also welcomes feedback or opinions, which can be sent to feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s6">Also, there will be press releases this week and another major announcement on August 21 to update the community on the new WERX development and plans for the relaunch. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx platform development is ongoing, and the team has completed certain sections like Settings, Security, Help Center, Login, Privacy Policy, Create Account, and Finished Payments.</p>
<p class="s6">The WERX allocations will also be changed, and the new allocation is:</p>
● Presale: 57% (427,500,000)
● User Performance Incentives: 6% (45,000,000) 
● Liquidity Reserve: 14% (105,500,000)
● Marketing: 9% (67,500,000) 
● Team Tokens: 6% (45,000,000) 
● Partnership Incentives: 2% (15,000,000)
● Joining Incentives: 6% ( 45,000,000) 
<p class="s6">At the end of the presale, 25,499,071 WERX will be burned. The airdrop and vesting schedules were shifted, and the new schedules have been released. Uwerx&rsquo;s whitepaper will also be modified to reflect the ongoing changes. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is on to big things, and once the polls are concluded on August 13, the team will announce the specific details of the new WERX, as they are committed to launching it as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx&rsquo;s dedication throughout this period has been incredible. Their efforts in tackling this challenge have removed all forms of doubt and fear the community initially had. No wonder its community has continued to gather momentum, growing to over 2,500 Telegram members and 2,000 Twitter followers.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx remains focused on its vision, which is to be a change in freelancing, and no matter what, it is resolved to achieve this purpose. So why not throw in your support? Be a part of this value-driven community by following the links below:</p>
