Biden officials call the downgrade decision “bizarre and baseless.” Both the White House and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen strongly disagreed with the downgrade decision. Yellen claimed that the change by Fitch Ratings “is arbitrary and based on outdated data.”</strong></p>
<h2>Fitch Downgrades US Rating</h2>
<p>Fitch Ratings, one of the three largest credit rating agencies in the U.S., downgraded the United States&#8217; long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+ on Tuesday. The rating agency <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-united-states-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa-outlook-stable-01-08-2023">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rating downgrade of the United States reflects the expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also reflects “a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to &#8216;AA&#8217; and &#8216;AAA&#8217; rated peers over the last two decades that has manifested in repeated debt limit standoffs and last-minute resolutions,” Fitch added.</p>
<p>“The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management,” the rating agency detailed. Moreover, Fitch explained that in its view, “there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025.”</p>
<p>In addition, Fitch described:</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect the general government (GG) deficit to rise to 6.3% of GDP in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022, reflecting cyclically weaker federal revenues, new spending initiatives and a higher interest burden.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rating agency placed the country’s credit rating on negative watch in May, citing the debt ceiling fight in Washington. Despite the U.S. successfully avoiding default on its debt obligations in June, Fitch maintained the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fitch-maintains-negative-watch-on-us-rating-despite-debt-limit-resolution/">negative watch</a>. However, in its announcement on Tuesday, Fitch clarified that the negative watch on the U.S. has been removed, and a &#8220;stable outlook&#8221; has been assigned.</p>

<h2>White House, Biden Officials, and Yellen Disagree</h2>
<p>Following the rating downgrade, officials from the Biden administration told journalists that the governance issues highlighted by Fitch occurred during former President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration. Noting that Fitch had maintained a AAA rating during that period, a senior Biden official said: &#8220;This is a bizarre and baseless decision for Fitch to make now &#8230; It simply defies common sense to take this downgrade as a result of what was really a mess caused by the last administration and reckless actions by congressional Republicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House also released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/01/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-the-recent-decision-by-fitch-ratings/">statement</a> following Fitch&#8217;s decision. &#8220;We strongly disagree with this decision,&#8221; White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. &#8220;The ratings model used by Fitch declined under President Trump and then improved under President Biden, and it defies reality to downgrade the United States at a moment when President Biden has delivered the strongest recovery of any major economy in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also released a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1665">statement</a> regarding the downgrade. She stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I strongly disagree with Fitch Ratings’ decision. The change by Fitch Ratings announced today is arbitrary and based on outdated data.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Fitch’s quantitative ratings model declined markedly between 2018 and 2020 — and yet Fitch is announcing its change now, despite the progress that we see in many of the indicators that Fitch relies on for its decision,&#8221; Yellen explained. &#8220;Many of these measures, including those related to governance, have shown improvement over the course of this administration, with the passage of bipartisan legislation to address the debt limit, invest in infrastructure, and make other investments in America’s competitiveness.&#8221;</p>

<h2>U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Odds Rise to 65%, Analysts Cite Blackrock Influence</h2>
<p>Following a wave of spot bitcoin ETF filings and revisions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now finds itself with several applications awaiting review. In the midst of June, Blackrock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager by assets under management (AUM), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">lodged</a> its spot bitcoin ETF application, with several other contenders quickly falling in line. Fast forward to August 2, 2023, and Bloomberg ETF analysts <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff">James Seyffart</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas">Eric Balchunas</a> publicly offered their insights regarding the SEC&#8217;s potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>“Based on recent events and new information Eric Balchunas and I are officially increasing our spot bitcoin ETF approval odds to 65%. That&#8217;s from 50% a couple of weeks ago and 1% a few months ago,” Seyffart <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1686707919696568320?s=20">posted</a> on the social media platform X. Seyffart’s post also shares a statement from both analysts which states:</p>
<p>&#8220;The odds of a spot bitcoin ETF launching this year are up to 65%, in our eyes, after a flurry of developments: Gary Gensler downplaying his role at the SEC, the commission&#8217;s tacit approval of Coinbase&#8217;s Bitcoin exchange, Grayscale&#8217;s attempt to minimize other filings and the SEC&#8217;s loss in front of the same judges in the Grayscale case. Finally, pressure from Blackrock and possibly Democrats could make denying the ETFs politically untenable for Gensler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seyffart <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1686709254185463808?s=20">emphasizes</a> that his team is speculating on the timing of the Grayscale case dates, but asserts that they envision the easiest path as simultaneous approval for all eight filers plus Grayscale, following the courts&#8217; overturning of the SEC&#8217;s denial. &#8220;The lynchpin&#8221; for this, Seyffart argues, is a triumph by Grayscale over the SEC in federal court. It could pave the way for a surge of SEC approvals sometime in the fourth quarter. However, that &#8220;all depends on how much Gensler wants to fight here,&#8221; Seyffart explains.</p>

Two-week statistics show HEX has lost 41.7% against the U.S. dollar and 35.8% over the past seven days.</strong></p>
<h2>Uniswap Delists HEX Following SEC Lawsuit; HEX Loses Over 40%</h2>
<p>In the past two weeks, HEX has shed more than 40% against the greenback, and on Aug. 2, 2023, the price is down around 2%. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-files-lawsuit-against-richard-heart-and-companies-hex-pulsechain-and-pulsex/">filed a lawsuit</a> against the creator of the Hex blockchain, Richard Schueler, also known as Richard Heart, and his companies Pulsechain and Pulsex.</p>

<p>The SEC complaint accuses Heart of offering and selling unregistered crypto tokens and defrauding investors by misappropriating funds. Two days after the SEC complaint was filed, the largest decentralized exchange, or dex, by trade volume, Uniswap, delisted HEX from the dex interface.</p>
<p>According to metrics, there&#x2019;s a circulating supply of 173,411,074,413 HEX based on the ERC20 standard; there&#x2019;s also a total supply of 581,233,513,031 HEX. Approximately <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/hex/richlist/">60.89%</a> of the circulating supply is held by the top 10 wallets among the 330,072 unique Ethereum addresses that hold HEX.</p>

<p>The top 100 addresses command 63.15% of the supply. On centralized exchanges that list HEX, the token has seen $5,183,908 in 24-hour global trade volume. This includes exchanges like Mexc, Bitget, Poloniex, Bitrue and Yobit, according to coingecko.com statistics.</p>

<h2>Gamestop to Discontinue iOS and Chrome Extension Wallets: Regulatory Challenges Cited</h2>
<p>Visitors to Gamestop&#8217;s online crypto hub, &#8220;<a href="https://nft.gamestop.com/">nft.gamestop.com</a>,&#8221; are now met with an announcement declaring the removal of the firm&#8217;s Web3 wallet. &#8220;Due to the regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space, Gamestop has decided to remove its iOS and Chrome Extension wallets from the market on November 1, 2023,” the statement from Gamestop explains.</p>

<p>The company first <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gamestop-nft-website-discovered-with-hidden-easter-egg-retro-game/">signaled</a> its interest in the non-fungible token (NFT) and Web3 domain in May 2021. A year later, in May 2022, Gamestop <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gamestop-launches-web3-ethereum-wallet-that-leverages-looprings-zk-rollup-tech/">launched</a> the firm&#8217;s Ethereum-based wallet, employing Loopring&#8217;s zk-rollup technology. In November 2022, several months later, the Gamestop NFT Marketplace was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gamestop-nft-marketplace-is-now-live-on-immutable-x-market-features-web3-games/">launched</a> on Immutable X, showcasing Web3 games and NFTs.</p>
<p>Gamestop remained vague about the specific regulations prompting the halt of its Web3 wallet venture, but 2023 has marked a year of substantial regulatory enforcement, especially in the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has categorized dozens of crypto assets as securities and maintains that some exchanges are conducting unregistered brokerage services.</p>

<p>This regulatory atmosphere has motivated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">Robinhood</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etoro-to-delist-algo-mana-dash-and-matic-for-us-customers-amid-evolving-regulatory-landscape/">Etoro</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bakkt-takes-proactive-measures-delists-polygon-solana-and-cardano-amid-regulatory-crackdowns/">Bakkt</a> to remove several crypto assets from their platforms. The Gamestop Wallet is a self-custodial wallet and the web portal’s announcement notes that people can leverage their secret passphrase to recover their accounts.</p>
<p>“We advise that all customers ensure that they have access to their secret passphrase by October 1, 2023,” Gamestop disclosed. “Any customer with access to their secret passphrase has the ability to recover their account in any compatible wallet.”</p>

<h2>Halving Unshaken: Litecoin Network Sees Third Reduction in Rewards</h2>
<p>On August 2, 2023, the Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) blockchain documented its third block reward halving. Litecoin&#x2019;s first halving transpired on August 25, 2015, at block height 840,000, and the second occurred on August 5, 2019, at block height 1,680,000.</p>
<p>The most recent reward halving, happening at block height 2,520,000, has reduced the reward from 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> to 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>. Prior to this halving event, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> miners generated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230731032236/https://www.litecoinblockhalf.com/">7,200 new LTC units</a> each day; that rate has now fallen to <a href="https://www.litecoinblockhalf.com">3,600</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-600821" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37.png" alt="" width="1554" height="1158" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37-300x224.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37-1024x763.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37-768x572.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37-1536x1145.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ltcusdt_2023-08-02_12-37-37.png 1554w" sizes="(max-width: 1554px) 100vw, 1554px"></p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> prices have decreased by over 4%, but they remained stable with a minor 0.2% increase throughout the previous week. At that point in time, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> miners received roughly $656,919 daily in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> rewards; this figure has now been cut to $331,946.</p>
<p>The data undeniably demonstrates that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> miners faced a considerable loss in revenue following the automated halving completion. Litecoin&#x2019;s annual inflation rate has plunged from 3.64% to the present figure of 1.80%; by the next halving event, it is expected to decline further to 0.84%.</p>
<p>Litecoin&#x2019;s current annual inflation rate is marginally higher than Bitcoin&#x2019;s rate of 1.70%. However, Bitcoin&#x2019;s inflation rate will alter in just 268 days during its upcoming halving event; Litecoin must wait for another&#x200B; &#x200B;1,458 days until its subsequent halving.</p>
<p>Following Bitcoin&#x2019;s halving, scheduled for on or around April 26, 2024, the yearly inflation rate will descend to 0.84%. At present, Litecoin&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart">total hashrate</a> remains relatively consistent, cruising at 834.16 terahash per second (TH/s).</p>
<p>Approaching the Litecoin halving, the hashrate surged two months earlier, culminating in an all-time peak of 1.03 petahash per second (PH/s) on July 4, 2023, at block height 2,503,485. This security of hashrate persists post-halving; only time will reveal if reduced revenue compels the hashrate to depart.</p>

The wider market cap was mostly higher in today’s session, led by the optimism surrounding Microstrategy’s latest bitcoin investment. Chainlink also jumped higher after recent losses. </strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) bounced back higher during Wednesday’s session, as the token moved away from a recent four-week low.</p>
<p>After plunging to a bottom $0.6751 on Tuesday, MATIC/USD rallied to a peak of $0.7022 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move came as bulls rejected a breakout below a recent price floor of $0.6750, which coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) pushing away from its own support level.</p>

<p>After racing from the aforementioned point at 43.00, the index made an attempt to reach resistance of 45.00.</p>
<p>However, at the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at a reading of 44.06, with MATIC back below $0.7000.</p>
<p>Overall, momentum appears to be bearish, with the token falling for five of the last seven sessions.</p>

<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>In addition to polygon, chainlink (LINK) rebounded from a recent losing streak which resulted in price hitting a one-week low.</p>
<p>LINK/USD leaped to an intraday high of $7.70 during today’s session, following a drop to a low of $7.40 the day prior.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s decline pushed chainlink below a support point of $7.50, and to its weakest level since July 26.</p>

<p>LINK has managed to recover from its earlier drop, as the RSI climbed away from its own floor at the 55.00 zone.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 56.78, and appears to be making a move towards a ceiling of 60.00.</p>
<p>In the event that this level is hit, there is a good chance that LINK moves above $7.80.</p>

Then, on Tuesday, the Japanese yen plummeted to its weakest position against the greenback in over 20 years, a shift that came after the Bank of Japan opted to keep its extremely loose monetary policy unchanged, despite the mounting pressures of inflation and a depreciating currency.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Yen&#8217;s Steepest Dive in 20 Years as BOJ Stands Firm on Loose Monetary Strategy</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The yen weakened past 143 to the dollar on Tuesday, down more than 5 yen from Friday when the Bank of Japan (BOJ) <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Currencies/Yen-falls-to-one-month-low-of-143-per-dollar-after-last-week-s-BOJ-move">announced</a> it would allow long-term yields to rise to 1% from 0.5%. The BOJ kept its key interest rate at -0.1% and said the 1% cap on 10-year bond yields was not a fixed target but a loose guideline.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Economists had <a href="https://www.nri.com/en/knowledge/blog/lst/2023/fis/kiuchi/0213_2">speculated</a> the BOJ would start normalizing policy to combat rising prices, but it cited wage-driven rather than cost-push inflation as the key factor in any changes. This <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/japanese-yen-depreciated-after-the-bank-of-japan-meeting-outcome-202308010926">disappointed</a> currency traders who sold the yen aggressively, reversing an initial 2% gain Friday.</p>

<p dir="ltr">BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-28/ueda-says-boj-policy-justified-by-weak-core-inflation-below-2">suggested</a> that it&#8217;s possible to start normalizing monetary policy if the BOJ becomes confident that inflation will pick up next year. However, Ueda also mentioned that for now, underlying inflation remains below 2% and the BOJ&#8217;s outlook is for price increases to slow toward the end of the year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&#8220;All these markets are linked together in terms of global liquidity flows. People borrow in yen to buy dollars, dollars sit around looking for something to do, people say we might buy Treasuries or Apple,&#8221; the global equities fund manager at Artemis, Simon Edelsten, told Reuters on July 27.</p>

<p>At the moment current bond market volatility suggests yields will remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 0.6%, up just 0.15 points since Thursday. Markets expect further BOJ intervention if yields spike too fast.

But uncertainty reigns over whether dollar strength or yen weakness will dominate.</p>

<p>After its filings, Microstrategy CFO Andrew Kang said: &#x201C;Our bitcoin holdings increased to 152,800 bitcoins as of July 31, 2023, with the addition in the second quarter of 12,333 bitcoins being the largest increase in a single quarter since Q2 2021.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) has found a firm support point at the 46.00 level, with price strength now tracking at 47.11.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) rebounded from Tuesday&#x2019;s losses, climbing back above the $1,850 level on hump-day.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD rallied to a high of $1,877.51 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which follows up from a low of $1,817.92 the day prior.</p>
<p>The move saw ethereum bounce back from yesterday&#x2019;s one-month low, and comes as the RSI found a stable floor at 45.00.</p>

The authorization will allow the crypto giant to offer exchange and other services for virtual assets to institutional and qualified retail investors. </strong></p>
<h2>Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority Grants Binance MVP License</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance announced Monday that its Dubai subsidiary, Binance FZE, has been issued with an Operational Minimum Viable Product (MVP) license by Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).</p>
<p>The license enables the platform to provide regulated services in and from Dubai such as exchange and broker-dealer services for crypto assets, initially limited to institutional and qualified retail investors, the company explained.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-is-the-first-virtual-asset-exchange-to-receive-an-operational-mvp-license-in-dubai-7342057061995039467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, Binance pointed out it’s the first exchange to secure an MVP license, describing the development as a “milestone achievement” that affirms its “commitment to building a compliant exchange in collaboration with local regulators.”</p>
<p>The latest regulatory approval for Binance in Dubai comes after in 2022, VARA granted the exchange a provisional MVP license in March and then a preparatory MVP license in September, the crypto firm noted in the announcement.</p>

<p>The upgrade to an Operational MVP License will allow eligible users in Dubai to access authorized services, including crypto-fiat conversion, under standards that are compliant with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FATF</a>).</p>
<p>“Operating within this regulated ecosystem, we are committed to ensuring secure and seamless customer migration, with robust Know-Your-Customer and Customer-Due-Diligence as part of the rigorous onboarding remediation as stipulated by VARA,” said Richard Teng, head of Regional Markets at .</p>
<p>The authorization in Dubai, UAE, comes at a time when Binance is under increased pressure from regulators in a number of other jurisdictions, including the United States where it’s fighting <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-cz-to-seek-dismissal-of-cftc-complaint/">lawsuits</a> filed by the securities and commodities commissions. In Europe, the crypto behemoth <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">pulled out</a> of a number of markets or <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-withdraws-its-crypto-license-application-in-germany/">withdrew</a> its applications for licenses.</p>

<h2>Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty Explains Securities, Investment Contracts, and Digital Currencies in Skit</h2>&#13;
<p>Stuart Alderoty, CLO of Ripple, a cryptocurrency and financial services company, presented a parody skit titled &#x201C;After Hours,&#x201D; where he explained the definitions of securities and investment contracts. The segment was prepared as a parody of the &#x201C;Office Hours&#x201D; series of videos, where U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler <a href="https://www.sec.gov/page/sec-chair-gary-gensler-launches-office-hours-video-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a> investment topics informally and educationally.</p>&#13;
<p>In the &#x201C;After Hours&#x201D; segment, Alderoty explains the concept of securities, stating that the law lists a group of things that are always securities, like a share of stock, where companies like Apple owe holders a fiduciary duty, with shareholders having the possibility of holding Apple accountable if it does not fulfill its obligations. Alderoty explains this &#x201C;is true no matter how you bought the stock.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>Also, he differentiates investment contracts from digital assets, explaining that, in his opinion, digital assets by themselves are not investment contracts. Alderoty <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1686027820533735424?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Some would like you to think that a digital token can in and of itself be a &#x2018;digital asset security.&#x2019; It can&#x2019;t. Standing alone, it&#x2019;s just a commodity or a virtual currency.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>Alderoty Blasts SEC&#x2019;s Overreach</h2>&#13;
<p>Alderoty continued to rail against the SEC&#x2019;s attempt to gain jurisdiction over things different from securities. As part of his presentation, he declared:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The SEC only has jurisdiction over securities &#x2026; and they don&#x2019;t like that. Like a hammer, they want everything to be a nail. But the law doesn&#x2019;t work like that.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Alderoty&#x2019;s explanation derives from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruling</a> reached by Judge Torres in the SEC v. Ripple case in July, where she <a href="https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/SEC%20vs%20Ripple%207-13-23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details</a> that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, a token used by Ripple in certain services, &#x201C;is not in and of itself a &#x2018;contract, transaction, or scheme&#x2019; that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>Ripple&#x2019;s CLO has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripple-clo-stuart-alderoty-states-sec-chair-gary-gensler-misstates-the-law-on-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> the behavior and statements of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on this issue before, stating that he constantly misstated the law &#x201C;suggesting that tokens, standing alone, are investment contracts.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
