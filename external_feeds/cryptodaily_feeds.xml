			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research and Sam Bankman-Fried's co-founder for FTX, has pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges as part of a deal for leniency in her own case.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The plea deal also includes Zixiao (Gary) Wang, another FTX co-founder. Bankman-Fried and Ellison were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. The two former FTX executives allegedly lied about the company's financial health and its ability to meet revenue expectations, while also hiding the fact that they had been selling most of their stock in order to pay off debts and disseminate investments into other shady dealings.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Wang was involved in the creation of certain features in the now-defunct exchange's contract and trading platform code which then allowed Alameda Research to maintain an "essentially unlimited line of credit on FTX" while also adjusting parameters for Alameda to gain an "unfair advantage when transacting on the platform," with faster trade execution finality and exemptions from other control parameters placed for regular clients.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">"These critical code features and structural exceptions allowed Alameda to secretly and recklessly siphon FTX customer assets from the FTX platform," the CFTC stated.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The plea deal was made in the Southern District of New York Court. Bankman-Fried, who just recently paid a $250 million bail after his hearing in Manhattan, faces eight charges for securities fraud and allegations of diverting cash to Alameda Research, which at the time was run by Ellison as a crypto hedge fund. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Bankman-Fried and Ellison also face separate charges in California, where they were charged for two counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, as well as one count of securities fraud. Alameda Research was also charged for its part in the alleged scheme. These charges include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy and conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum prison terms of 20 years.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Until crypto platforms comply with time-tested securities laws, risks to investors will persist," he continued. "It remains a priority of the SEC to use all of our available tools to bring the industry into compliance." stated Gary Gensler, 33rd Chair of the SEC.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a separate charge has also been made towards Wang and Ellison's involvement in defrauding equity investors from FTX. Statements from the authorities confirm that both Wang and Ellison have signed for full cooperation with New York officials, building the case against Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">"If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda, now is the time to get ahead of it. We are moving quickly and our patience is not eternal," warned U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a video statement.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cardano (ADA) dropped to a multiyear low last week. The coin is currently trading at a critical threshold that could open up for further drops ahead.</p>
<p>It is by far ADA&rsquo;s most disappointing year, falling from its all-time high of $3 recorded just a year ago.</p>
<p>Analysts say this is the best time for Cardano (ADA) holders to jump into The Hideaways (HDWY) as a way to recover their losses and hedge against market volatility.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) Still Has Room for a Big Retracement</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) declined to its lowest level in many years. ADA is currently trading at $0.25, carving another opportunity to print the lower low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price is down 14.27% in the last seven days which sent its total losses this year to 80%. This is a huge disappointment for the crypto community - Cardano (ADA) is known as the next Ethereum (ETH) killer, after all.</p>
<p>And although they are operating on the same business base, ADA underperformed against ETH by 29.93% year-on-year.</p>
<p>Analysts gave out their negative price forecast for Cardano (ADA) at the same time they upgraded projections for The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) is expected to reclaim the $0.15 support level if buying sentiment does not improve at $0.25. From the current state of things, we are more likely to see $0.15 back on the charts before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA)&rsquo;s Technicals Point to Low Investor Sentiment</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA)&rsquo;s 24-hour trading volume has declined to $63.82 million from its $116 million level on December 16. This shows the lack of buying appetite for the crypto major as fear takes hold.</p>
<p>Moreover, its relative strength index remains in the oversold territory after falling to the critical level on December 15. RSI is now at 26.70 - a result below 30.0 shows strong selling pressure while a result above 70.0 indicates buyers&rsquo; dominance.</p>
<p>As of late, Cardano (ADA) is not working on any visible projects that could propel prices back to the green. This means we will be seeing more volatility in the coming weeks which is a clear signal to go elsewhere. Among the top investor choice is The Hideaways (HDWY), a real estate project everybody&rsquo;s taking an interest in.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) to Give a 9,000% ROI in 2023</p>
<p>If you are a Cardano (ADA) holder looking for a new investment to make, do not miss out on The Hideaways (HDWY).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new cryptocurrency project works in the luxury real estate industry - the first to introduce decentralization into traditional property acquisitions.</p>
<p>Buying an NFT from The Hideaways (HDWY) is very similar to buying your real estate property. The project&rsquo;s digital collectibles are underpinned by real-world assets that yield at least 20% passive income monthly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best thing about this is you are practically one of the owners of luxury real estate, but since you&rsquo;re splitting the ownership among many other people, the cost is affordable. The Hideaways (HDWY) fractionalized NFTs start at $100 - a good kickstart for your real estate investment career.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) is holding a $100,000 prize draw for all token holders. Score it at only $0.10 for a chance to win this fortune.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Top cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) suffers from overwhelming declines as it trades less than its viable trading mark, losing numerous old-time investors and switching their holdings to the new real estate project in the market The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) Loses Long-Term Holders</p>
<p>According to On-chain reports, Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) long-term holders are dumping all their coins as the crypto plunges below its $17,000 trading level. They foresee that the threshold of holding the king coin could result in either greater profit or massive losses.</p>
<p>At the same time, some short-term &ldquo;speculators&rdquo; felt acute problems caused by the bearish decline. Because of the sharp plunge, the long-term holders and speculators are gearing up their portfolios and purchasing The Hideaways (HDWY) for better momentum.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) being the top digital asset could be in danger of losing even the most famed investors but several holders are still holding their capital in hopes of a bounce back by early 2023.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis For 2023</p>
<p>Within the past 24 trading hours, Bitcoin's (BTC) price broke the barrier below its $17,000 mark and dropped to its crucial support level of $16,500. Following the FTX fallout and the broader price correction, the crypto market is crashing massively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to crypto analysts CredibleCrypto, the price of the crypto must hold the $16,500 mark to rebound from the red zone. He also mentioned that if it were to break past that barrier, then the danger of reaching the $15,600 mark is nearing.</p>
<p>Security is one of the top priorities of Bitcoin (BTC) users so if the bearish market occurs they will worry less as they could hedge themselves by purchasing&nbsp; The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) Users Prefer The Hideaways (HDWY) For 2023</p>
<p>With the sudden spark of the Bitcoin (BTC) decline, market participants are exiting the doors to get better investment stability and growth. The Hideaways (HDWY) ramps itself and becomes a top pick for the king coin users for their 2023 investment journey.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) is also kicking off a prize draw that allows the winner to acquire $100,000 in cash in total. To make things more exciting, the project team announced that there will be a 100% bonus on all investments.</p>
<p>The presale event is nearing its end by December 31 and various investors are flocking their way to join the community and gain massive rewards that could accumulate to more than 6000% of their initial deposit by 2023.</p>
<p>The token is trading at $0.1. Don&rsquo;t miss the chance to be part of the millionaire club by 2023!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Litecoin (LTC) went against all odds when it pulled a bull run whilst the FTX crashed. But it was not the same case lately - the price is down 16.88% in the last 7 days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Hideaways (HDWY) takes the center stage after announcing a $100,000 prize draw for all token holders. The reward is a celebration of the success of its initial presale ending on December 31.</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) Trades on a Support Level</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) currently trades on a support level that historically sent the price to the $85.00 zone. LTC is selling at $63.62, down 8.34% in the latest charts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question here is whether the crypto major will get enough buying support to send its price back to its December 5 high at $84.95.</p>
<p>Looking at its technical indicators, sellers will not likely give up their position. The relative strength index is at 34.56, indicating Litecoin (LTC) is nearing the oversold territory.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 50-day EMA takes above the 20-day EMA, indicating bears&rsquo; dominance.</p>
<p>Investors took the negative signals as a chance to buy into The Hideaways (HDWY) which is currently holding a $100,000 prize draw.</p>
<p>Whale Accumulation Spotted on Litecoin (LTC) Charts</p>
<p>Despite its recent depreciation, Litecoin (LTC) whales continue to accumulate.</p>
<p>The latest on-chain analysis reveals that whale addresses with 1 million or more LTC coins have accumulated an additional 2.95 million Litecoin (LTC) valued at $220 million at the current market price.</p>
<p>Other tokens enjoying massive acquisitions lately are Shiba Inu (SHIB) and The Hideaways (HDWY), with the latter promising a 9,000% growth for 2023.</p>
<p>Due to this strong whale support, analysts upgraded their Litecoin (LTC) price projections - LTC is expected to climb to $73.54 next week. On the other hand, a continued weak performance will show $47.88, a November 9 low, back on the daily charts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) Holds $100,000 Prize Draw for Crypto Fans</p>
<p>There is no question. The Hideaways (HDWY) is the most successful presale token of 2022. The project sold 50% of its offerings just a month after launch. What&rsquo;s behind this high demand? Its real estate backing. Everybody wants to get a hold of something steady lately.</p>
<p>To celebrate the success of its initial presale event, it will hold a $100,000 prize draw open for all crypto fans. Knowing how much you lost from the Terra Luna and FTX crash, this is a chance to get your crypto portfolio healthy again.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) token sells at $0.10, a small investment that could get you both an easy way to fortune and a steady, passive income monthly.</p>
<p>The new project underpins its NFTs with luxury real estate properties that yield at least 20% of passive income. This real estate link ensures your investment does not crumble on demand whenever volatility takes over the crypto market.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss your chance to get on the best investment of 2022.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Litecoin (LTC) went against all odds when it pulled a bull run whilst the FTX crashed. But it was not the same case lately - the price is down 16.88% in the last 7 days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Hideaways (HDWY) takes the center stage after announcing a $100,000 prize draw for all token holders. The reward is a celebration of the success of its initial presale ending on December 31.</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) Trades on a Support Level</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) currently trades on a support level that historically sent the price to the $85.00 zone. LTC is selling at $63.62, down 8.34% in the latest charts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question here is whether the crypto major will get enough buying support to send its price back to its December 5 high at $84.95.</p>
<p>Looking at its technical indicators, sellers will not likely give up their position. The relative strength index is at 34.56, indicating Litecoin (LTC) is nearing the oversold territory.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 50-day EMA takes above the 20-day EMA, indicating bears&rsquo; dominance.</p>
<p>Investors took the negative signals as a chance to buy into The Hideaways (HDWY) which is currently holding a $100,000 prize draw.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Twitter Business on Thursday unveiled price chart support for major crypto and stock assets. </p>
<p>Twitter on Thursday revealed a new feature called $Cashtags, with price chart support for major cryptocurrency and stock assets. Tech billionaire and Twitter&rsquo;s new owner, Elon Musk, shared a feature designed specifically for the financial sector, with particular benefit for traders, financial experts, investors, and organisations. $Cashtags helps users see graphs, charts, and other data of stocks, cryptos, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) within a tweet.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">$Cashtags, now with data 📈👀 $SPY 👇 pic.twitter.com/XgOK6gf02E</p>
&mdash; Twitter Business (@TwitterBusiness) December 21, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>The official Twitter Business account said:</p>

<p>When you Tweet the symbol of a major stock, ETF, or cryptocurrency with a $ in front of it (like $BTC), people on Twitter see a clickable link that takes them to search results. Starting today, these search results will include the pricing graphs for major symbols.</p>

<p>It further added:</p>

<p>You can also search for symbols directly, without clicking on a link within a Tweet. Most symbols with and without the $ sign will work in search (QQQ or $QQQ).</p>

<p>To unlock the new feature, users can click on $BTC and $ETH or search for any crypto asset. A link &ndash; &lsquo;View on Robinhood&rsquo;- will take users to the wallet provider. The addition of a linkage to Robinhood may signal the possibility of a future partnership between the two firms, but no official announcement has been made.</p>
Could This Be a Hint at Integrating Crypto Payments?
<p>Elon Musk praised the team at Twitter and commented that this is just &ldquo;one of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter!&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">One of many product improvements coming to financial Twitter! Nice work by Twitter team. https://t.co/CKLH8OtDDW</p>
&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 22, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>Musk has in the past indicated that his personal crypto holdings consist of only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin (DOGE) and since his takeover of Twitter, Doge holders have been eagerly awaiting the announcement of a payments integration. The tech mogul however announced that he is stepping down as chief of Twitter, and Dogecoin has naturally responded negatively in the market after it outperformed the market in November not long after the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October.</p>
<p>A lawsuit was also filed in September accusing Musk of running a pyramid scheme to support DOGE.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday announced that it has set its eyes on audit firms working for cryptocurrency companies. </p>
<p>According to reports by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the SEC has said it will increase scrutiny of audit firms producing audit reports for crypto companies. The regulatory body explained that it needs to follow this course of action as concerns have arisen that investors are getting false reassurance from auditing reports and are risking exposure to cryptocurrencies. Many crypto firms have had to publish reports on the state of their reserves as the contagion from the bankruptcy of FTX continues to spread. Several crypto exchanges proposed to release proof-of-reserves to offer customers reassurance that their funds are safe and to prove that the firm is financially healthy and stable.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Acting Chief Accountant Paul Munter told the WSJ:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re warning investors to be very wary of some of the claims&nbsp;that are being made by crypto companies.</p>

SEC Heightens its Scrutiny of Audit Reports
<p>The SEC holds by its anti-crypto stance and has systematically increased its monitoring of companies involved with digital assets as the industry continues to grow. As crypto firms now are being forced to reveal the state of their finances, the SEC has decided to look more closely at how cryptocurrency firms portray their reports from audit firms. As regulatory pressure surrounding cryptocurrencies remains a grey area, banks and auditing firms have been reluctant to work with crypto firms.</p>
<p>The most recent example of this saw France-based firm Mazars temporarily suspend its auditing services to Binance, Crypto.com, and KuCoin. Mazars even went as far as to remove the link to Binance&rsquo;s proof-of-reserve assessment from its website after it found the exchange&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves to be overcollateralized. Bloomberg was the first to report that Mazars had suspended its services to the aforementioned crypto firms and further reported that other auditing firms such as FTX&rsquo;s auditor Armanino also halted their work with crypto exchanges such as OKX and Gate.io.</p>
<p>The SEC is for this reason sending warnings to audit firms working on crypto audits as it believes crypto exchanges are using proof-of-reserve reports from audit firms for their benefit. The danger in this the SEC believes is that it contains limited financial details to assess whether a company does have sufficient assets to cover its liabilities.</p>
Gary Gensler: Investors Remain Exposed to Crypto Risks
<p>Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, stated investors remain exposed to the risks surrounding the crypto industry until these firms comply with time-tested securities laws. Gensler was speaking in response to the agency&rsquo;s charges of fraud against former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang. Gensler added that it remains a priority for the agency to use all tools at its disposal to bring the cryptocurrency industry into compliance.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Off 63% in 2022:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 23 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained pressured early in the Asian session as the pair continued to trade around the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent rebound saw BTC/USD test the 18469.40 area, a level it could not sustain as elevated risk aversion resulted in more downward pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (hourly) and above the 100-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16829.67 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16763.91.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>-The strategic partnership will allow AFA to engage fans with a better understanding of how the metaverse works, how to contribute and benefit, while also expanding fan engagement and connecting fans to the teams and players they admire&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The partnership represents the first Argentinian football presence in the metaverse and the first time for Upland to offer exclusive in-game video footage ownership to fans</p>
<p>The Argentine Football Association (AFA), FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022&trade; World Champions, and Uplandme, Inc. the leading metaverse platform in mapping the real world that already has more than 3 million registered accounts, today announced the signing of an official license agreement to bring the First Division Argentina (Professional Football League or short &ldquo;LPF&rdquo;) to the Upland metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategic partnership will allow AFA and LPF to engage Argentinian fans with the metaverse, contributing to the digital community while benefiting from the extensive participation of the global Argentinian football community, connecting users with their teams and favorite players.

Not only does Upland connect fans, collectors and players from around the world in a single virtual network, but the open metaverse platform also has various gamified opportunities for users to interact with a complete set of iconic Argentine football digital collectibles including teams, Clubs, Players, Tickets, Gameplay Footage, Historical Moments, Platform Exclusive Moments, and the Official Upland Market.</p>
<p>This agreement is a further expression of the internationalization of the Argentine Football Association and the reach of the Argentine Professional Football League brand, attracting new fan audiences: global gamers, web3 enthusiasts and collectors of digital assets in virtual markets.</p>
<p>This deal represents the first presence of Argentine soccer in the metaverse and the first time Upland has offered exclusive ownership of in-game video to its fans. During the next four years, a new source of income will be created for the Argentine Professional Football League, through the acquisition by the user of multiple assets of virtual goods licenses.</p>
<p>Through this strategic partnership, Argentine soccer fans will gain a unique experience within the metaverse benefiting from a community environment focused on first division football.</p>
<p>Unique to Upland, fans can start virtual businesses to resell LPF virtual goods and other digital collectibles in player-owned and operated shops located on their virtual properties &ndash; including the 22 cities that are already open in Upland. Upland&rsquo;s agreement with the Argentine Football Association also expands its involvement with global and European football following the recently launched partnership with FIFA, where fans are able to get access to the highlights of the FIFA World CupTM &nbsp;including the goals of the final as digital collectibles.</p>
<p>Claudio Fabian Tapia, President of AFA, said: &ldquo;We are very happy to present this new commercial strategic agreement with Upland. The Argentine Professional League has long awaited opportunities to take advantage of emerging technologies to enhance our League's fan experience. This agreement allows us to partner with the best creators of technology and new digital products and thus generate a new source of income for all participating clubs. We welcome Upland as a new commercial partner of our Argentine Football Association and the Argentine Professional Football League.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk Lueth, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Upland, said: &ldquo;We are thrilled with the completely loaded licensing agreement and partnership with the AFA to continue to expand Upland&rsquo;s footprint and community around the world. With AFA, we are able to offer more opportunities than ever before to Argentinian fans new and old, empowering them with the true meaning of web3, which is community-focused and entrepreneurial, allowing fans to contribute ideas and creations to showcase their team pride in engaging new ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leandro Petersen, Chief Commercial Marketing Officer of AFA, said: &ldquo;Upland is at the forefront of a new category of virtual NFT memorabilia. The platform uniquely combines digital collectibles uniting all global NFT markets into their own Metaverse. In this way, our Professional League will be able to get closer to football fans from all over the world and to the players who hope to be closer to the stars of our Argentine football teams every day. We are excited about the potential of this association and it is very important for us to continue generating new sources of income for AFA and the LPF. We continue with the expansion process started and develop digital products that increase the presence of Argentine Soccer in the world. With this agreement with Upland, we are achieving a great goal for the Argentine Professional Football League.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With only 10% of the Central African Republic having access to the internet, how has Bitcoin fared in the country since its adoption a few months ago?</p>
<p>When the Central African Republic (CAR) adopted Bitcoin as legal currency, many were exultant at the news. However, as Bitcoin has spiralled down into the depths of a bear market, things are not yet looking up, and there are also many other factors at play.</p>
<p>According to Vice World News, Bitcoin use has been limited since its adoption, and there&rsquo;s really no lack of understanding as to why. With 14% of the population blessed with electricity, and only 10% having access to the internet, only tourists have really been using the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Before Bitcoin, the land-locked country used the CFA franc, a currency used by a group of African countries, but disliked by many because of its links to its French colonial master.</p>
<p>President Faustin-Archange Touadera said at the time of the adoption &ldquo;The alternative to cash is cryptocurrency. For us, the formal economy is no longer an option&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As per the Vice article, Alex Lielacher, founder and CEO of Rise Up Media, a marketing agency that works with Bitcoin startups, says that given the absence of a Bitcoin community in CAR, he was surprised to see the cryptocurrency get legal adoption.</p>
<p>However, he did think that the CAR move towards Bitcoin had made France sit up and take notice that there was an alternative to the CFA. On the other hand, there were also other very powerful enemies that could be made:</p>

<p>&ldquo;there are powerful institutions like the International Monetary Fund, for example, which CAR has to deal with, that are not happy about countries adopting Bitcoin. So there could be challenges that the government will have to deal with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The subsequent development of the CAR government&rsquo;s own cryptocurrency, the &ldquo;Sangocoin&rdquo;, has probably further muddied the waters. The listing of Sangocoin has been delayed by the government, and according to Reuters, only 0.01% of its sales target have been reached.</p>
<p>Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation, is a fervent exponent of Bitcoin, but he is not happy with how the CAR government has developed its cryptocurrency plan. He told Vice World News:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So while I am very sympathetic to a vulnerable and poor nation adopting Bitcoin as a second currency &ndash; especially a nation that has been controlled financially by its former colonial power for decades and decades, I am not very optimistic about how the execution has unfolded,&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems like the president is interested in Bitcoin and there's a small group of people around him who exploited that interest to be able to pass these laws to try and get the Sangocoin going, which they had a vision to make a ton of money off of.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian province of British Columbia announced that it is suspending new requests for electricity connections for cryptocurrency miners for 18 months. </p>
<p>The energy ministry of British Columbia (B.C.) said it is suspending new requests for power from cryptocurrency mining operations at least for the next 18 months. The announcement will not affect miners that already operate in the province. The government of B.C. announced in a statement on December 21 that the pause will allow the province to preserve its power &ndash; most of which is generated through hydroelectricity. The ministry added that the halt will also allow time for the provincial government and First Nations to establish a cryptocurrency mining policy framework. Seven mining projects that already operate in the province and six projects that are in the advanced stages of planning will not be affected by the decision. The mining projects already operating in the province use 273 megawatts of power.</p>
<p>Josie Obsborne, Minister of Energy, Mines, and Low Carbon Innovation said in a statement:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency mining consumes massive amounts of energy to run and cool banks of high-powered computers 24/7/365. Adding, &ldquo;We are suspending electricity connection requests from cryptocurrency mining operators to preserve our electricity supply for people who are switching to electric vehicles and heat pumps, and for businesses and industries that are undertaking electrification projects that reduce carbon emissions and generate jobs and economic opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the statement by the Ministry, 21 mining projects have requested energy connections and will subsequently be denied permission for the time being. The outstanding requests would require 1,403 megawatts of power, which is sufficient to power more than 500,000 homes or 2.1 million electric vehicles per year.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Pok&eacute;mon Company is taking an Australian crypto game company to court for using characters from the Pok&eacute;mon franchise without permission.</p>
<p>The Pok&eacute;mon Company International (TPCi) is suing Pok&eacute;mon Pty Ltd, an Australian company, in the Federal Court of Australia over the advertisement of a new NFT-based Pok&eacute;mon mobile game called Pok&eacute;World, under the name Kotiota Studios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT game lets a player choose a starting Pok&eacute;mon from a selection of Charmander, Pikachu, or Eevee, then allows the player to battle others for resources and $POKESHARD currency. In-game items such as food, clothing, and amulets etc., are minted on the blockchain as NFTs.</p>
<p>TPCi claims that Pok&eacute;mon Pty Ltd has falsely advertised itself as a contractor for the Pok&eacute;mon Company and has listed Pok&eacute;mon Scarlet, Pok&eacute;mon Violet, Pok&eacute;mon Home, and the unreleased Pok&eacute;mon Sleep as games it has worked on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TPCi has requested that the court stop Pok&eacute;mon Pty Ltd from using its trademarks on the PokeWorld website and social media, and from launching the game or selling any NFTs using TPCi's intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kotiota Studios team reportedly contacted media outlets to promote their game, which alerted TPCi to the situation. The first hearing for the case took place on December 21st, 2022, with TPCi's legal counsel present but no representatives from Kotiota Studios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Counsel for TPCi stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The PokeWorld Website advertises a new game &ldquo;brought to you by The Pok&eacute;mon Company International and Kotiota&ldquo;. I understand that Kotiota Studios (Kotiota) is an entity related to the respondents in their business endeavour the subject of these proceedings. On that website, there is a section titled &ldquo;2022-2023 ROADMAP&rdquo; which appears to outline the timeline for the launch of PokeWorld and release of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) related to Pok&eacute;mon characters. A review of that web page indicates that the PokeWorld game will launch in January 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The court has stated that TPCi has a strong case and is seeking more information before determining costs or damages. Further legal action may be taken if Pok&eacute;mon Pty Ltd does not respond.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Image Source</p>
<p>The gaming industry has come a long way since its humble beginnings of playing Pac-Man in a dimly lit corner of the arcade. These days, it's possible to play with people from all over the world in massive, multiplayer games. From titles such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 to the increasingly popular battle royale games like Fortnite and Apex Legends &ndash; gaming has become an incredibly social experience.</p>
<p>Enter the concept of gaming guilds. These clans of like-minded players have become a popular way for gamers to socialize and show their skills while forming tight-knit communities, and it looks as though the power of Web3 technology is about to bring a whole new spin to the idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What are gaming guilds?
<p>To put it simply, a gaming guild (also known as a clan) is an organized group of players that play together in the same game. They often have their own distinct identities and special features, such as logos and colors, that help set them apart from other guilds.</p>
<p>Guilds are a great way for players to meet new people, learn from each other, and compete against other guilds to prove their skills. They can also offer members rewards for playing together and taking part in events, while also uniting fans of eSports and other gaming-related content.</p>
<p>You can find guilds that are dedicated to just one game, such as those you will find on World of Warcraft servers, or larger guilds that operate across multiple games and genres. Here are some popular examples of the latter, all of which operate as professional eSport teams in the Web2 gaming world:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Fnatic &ndash; A world-renowned eSports organization focused mainly on Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Dota 2, and League of Legends.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Team Liquid &ndash; A professional eSports team founded in 2000 and based in the Netherlands, with teams for nearly all major competitive games.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">FaZe Clan &ndash; An American eSports organization that specializes in first-person shooter and battle royale titles such as Call of Duty, PUBG, Fortnite, Rainbow Six Siege, and Apex Legends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are also more casual Web2 guilds that are perfect for people who just want to hang out and have some fun without the pressure of competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The tokenization of gaming guilds
<p>Web3 has opened up a world of possibilities across just about every industry, and gaming is no exception. As such, for the guilds that want to take things up a notch, tokenization offers some exciting opportunities.</p>
<p>By using blockchain technology, guild owners are able to create and manage their own digital tokens, which they can use to reward members for activities such as playing together, competing in tournaments, or even creating content. These tokens can also be used to buy and sell virtual assets, such as skins or in-game items, giving guilds a chance to generate their own revenue streams and create a secondary marketplace for their members.</p>
<p>This is an exciting proposition for gamers, as it gives them the chance to own a piece of something bigger than themselves and potentially generate some income from their favorite games. For guild owners, it can also be a great way to incentivize and reward their members, while also providing them with more control over how their guild operates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
How tokenized gaming guilds will function
<p>At a basic level, tokenized gaming guilds will work in much the same way as traditional guilds. Members will join the guild and have access to certain privileges and benefits, such as being able to chat in the guild&rsquo;s dedicated channels, access exclusive tournaments and events, receive rewards for playing together, and even earn digital tokens for their activities.</p>
<p>However, the key difference is that these tokens will be stored on a blockchain and will be transferable to other players or even outside exchanges. This means that members can use the tokens to buy and sell virtual assets, as well as earn rewards for their participation in the guild.</p>
<p>While this is still a relatively new concept, there are already some exciting projects that are exploring how tokenized gaming guilds could function. For example, Legendary: Heroes Unchained (LHU) is a brand new, play-to-own RPG game built from the ground up for blockchain by N3twork Studios.</p>
<p>Within LHU, which is set in the same world as the blockbuster mobile hit Legendary: Game of Heroes, players can join or create their own gaming guilds and earn digital tokens through events, tournaments, and other activities. With the help of blockchain technology, LHU's in-game items are stored as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the Ethereum network, meaning that players can buy and sell their loot for real money. This raises the stakes for guilds and clans, as the game&rsquo;s digital economy adds a whole new level of competition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Fnatic also looks like it has its eyes set on establishing a presence in the Web3 space. The eSports team recently partnered with Hivemind Capital, a Web3 investment firm, in order to &lsquo;accelerate Fnatic&rsquo;s ability to partner as well as natively develop and scale web3 applications across its award-winning esports platform.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership, the CEO and Founder of Fnatic, Sam Matthews, had this to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The partnership with Hivemind represents a big step for us towards a world where every gamer owns their digital assets and most games have an app-store-like developer-user ecosystem that&rsquo;s transparent, thriving and enables millions more gamers to make a living from gaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Final word
<p>With the introduction of Web3 to the gaming world, it will be interesting to see how tokenized gaming guilds develop. With the potential to earn rewards and compete in tournaments, as well as buy and sell virtual items, these new types of guilds could introduce a whole new level of social interaction and competition to the gaming landscape.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether these guilds will become popular and stay around for the long haul, but there&rsquo;s no denying that they could be a game-changer for the industry.</p>

<p>The gaming industry has come a long way since its humble beginnings of playing Pac-Man in a dimly lit corner of the arcade. These days, it's possible to play with people from all over the world in massive, multiplayer games. From titles such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 to the increasingly popular battle royale games like Fortnite and Apex Legends &ndash; gaming has become an incredibly social experience.</p>
<p>Enter the concept of gaming guilds. These clans of like-minded players have become a popular way for gamers to socialize and show their skills while forming tight-knit communities, and it looks as though the power of Web3 technology is about to bring a whole new spin to the idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What are gaming guilds?
<p>To put it simply, a gaming guild (also known as a clan) is an organized group of players that play together in the same game. They often have their own distinct identities and special features, such as logos and colors, that help set them apart from other guilds.</p>
<p>Guilds are a great way for players to meet new people, learn from each other, and compete against other guilds to prove their skills. They can also offer members rewards for playing together and taking part in events, while also uniting fans of eSports and other gaming-related content.</p>
<p>You can find guilds that are dedicated to just one game, such as those you will find on World of Warcraft servers, or larger guilds that operate across multiple games and genres. Here are some popular examples of the latter, all of which operate as professional eSport teams in the Web2 gaming world:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Fnatic &ndash; A world-renowned eSports organization focused mainly on Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Dota 2, and League of Legends.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Team Liquid &ndash; A professional eSports team founded in 2000 and based in the Netherlands, with teams for nearly all major competitive games.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">FaZe Clan &ndash; An American eSports organization that specializes in first-person shooter and battle royale titles such as Call of Duty, PUBG, Fortnite, Rainbow Six Siege, and Apex Legends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are also more casual Web2 guilds that are perfect for people who just want to hang out and have some fun without the pressure of competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The tokenization of gaming guilds
<p>Web3 has opened up a world of possibilities across just about every industry, and gaming is no exception. As such, for the guilds that want to take things up a notch, tokenization offers some exciting opportunities.</p>
<p>By using blockchain technology, guild owners are able to create and manage their own digital tokens, which they can use to reward members for activities such as playing together, competing in tournaments, or even creating content. These tokens can also be used to buy and sell virtual assets, such as skins or in-game items, giving guilds a chance to generate their own revenue streams and create a secondary marketplace for their members.</p>
<p>This is an exciting proposition for gamers, as it gives them the chance to own a piece of something bigger than themselves and potentially generate some income from their favorite games. For guild owners, it can also be a great way to incentivize and reward their members, while also providing them with more control over how their guild operates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
How tokenized gaming guilds will function
<p>At a basic level, tokenized gaming guilds will work in much the same way as traditional guilds. Members will join the guild and have access to certain privileges and benefits, such as being able to chat in the guild&rsquo;s dedicated channels, access exclusive tournaments and events, receive rewards for playing together, and even earn digital tokens for their activities.</p>
<p>However, the key difference is that these tokens will be stored on a blockchain and will be transferable to other players or even outside exchanges. This means that members can use the tokens to buy and sell virtual assets, as well as earn rewards for their participation in the guild.</p>
<p>While this is still a relatively new concept, there are already some exciting projects that are exploring how tokenized gaming guilds could function. For example, Legendary: Heroes Unchained (LHU) is a brand new, play-to-own RPG game built from the ground up for blockchain by N3twork Studios.</p>
<p>Within LHU, which is set in the same world as the blockbuster mobile hit Legendary: Game of Heroes, players can join or create their own gaming guilds and earn digital tokens through events, tournaments, and other activities. With the help of blockchain technology, LHU's in-game items are stored as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the Ethereum network, meaning that players can buy and sell their loot for real money. This raises the stakes for guilds and clans, as the game&rsquo;s digital economy adds a whole new level of competition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Fnatic also looks like it has its eyes set on establishing a presence in the Web3 space. The eSports team recently partnered with Hivemind Capital, a Web3 investment firm, in order to &lsquo;accelerate Fnatic&rsquo;s ability to partner as well as natively develop and scale web3 applications across its award-winning esports platform.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership, the CEO and Founder of Fnatic, Sam Matthews, had this to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The partnership with Hivemind represents a big step for us towards a world where every gamer owns their digital assets and most games have an app-store-like developer-user ecosystem that&rsquo;s transparent, thriving and enables millions more gamers to make a living from gaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Final word
<p>With the introduction of Web3 to the gaming world, it will be interesting to see how tokenized gaming guilds develop. With the potential to earn rewards and compete in tournaments, as well as buy and sell virtual items, these new types of guilds could introduce a whole new level of social interaction and competition to the gaming landscape.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether these guilds will become popular and stay around for the long haul, but there&rsquo;s no denying that they could be a game-changer for the industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Gotbit, a leading Web3 market making service provider, has presented their annual report covering key financial and strategic metrics. The hedge fund has succeeded amidst bear market conditions and has outperformed the planned metrics.</p>
<p>The company presented an infographic displaying the results of the three main operational directions: market making, ventures, and development. Gotbit has strengthened its position throughout the year, resulting in the rapid growth of the key metrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary direction of the company, market making, showed a cumulative profit of $170,000,000 from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Thanks to their vast expertise in the Web3 market and development, the firm was able to connect to 14 new decentralized exchanges on 8 different blockchains. During 2022, the Gotbit team onboarded 241 new tokens, resulting in accelerated development despite the bear market conditions. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning the projects that the Gotbit team worked closely with during the year on market making and other approaches &ndash; Syscoin (SYS), PowerPool (CVP), vEmpire (VEMP).</p>
<p>Another branch of Gotbit&rsquo;s, their VC, has also shown a massive outcome. As an incubator, Gotbit works closely with potential token issuers from the concept stage to the IDO and beyond. During the year, more than 1,200 projects were introduced to the company&rsquo;s incubator. Gotbit has helped their clients raise $23,000,000 combined during funding rounds, which can be considered as remarkable results within the current market conditions. Being a VC fund themselves, the company has invested in 26 projects in the seed stage.</p>
<p>As for development, the company also shared the results of its work in 2022. Namely, a total amount of 52 products were developed for both clients and internal use, with a total of 184,220 lines of code delivered. The products developed by the dev team included launchpads, vesting mechanisms, NFT platforms, and more.</p>
<p>In addition to the financial and operational breakthroughs, the team also expanded their global presence, resulting in the opening of new offices in New York, Lisbon, and Dubai.</p>
<p>Alex Andryunin, CEO at Gotbit, emphasized the outstanding results that the company achieved this year:</p>

<p>Despite the long-running bear market conditions, Gotbit&rsquo;s financial metrics are showing stable MoM growth thanks to our adaptive strategic and operational approach. Even when such whales as Alameda and FTX are failing, Gotbit has proven its stability. I would like to thank our team, partners, and, especially our clients for their trust and support.</p>

<p>Unlike most of the other market making service providers, Gotbit tends to be more transparent in terms of both liquidity management and market insights. Recently, Andryunin shared the insights of their hedge fund combined in the document called &ldquo;The Magic Table&rdquo; which shows the fund&rsquo;s strategy in the bear market.</p>
<p>About Gotbit</p>
<p>Gotbit is a performance-focused hedge fund &amp; crypto market maker that operates both on centralized and decentralized exchanges. Founded back in 2017, the company has progressed in new directions, specifically, web3 development, an incubator, consulting, and many more.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Swarm, a decentralized storage and communication system built on Ethereum, has launched its mainnet storage incentives program, which rewards storage providers with Swarm's utility token (BZZ). The program is open to anyone who can share storage space and an internet connection. The rewards are based on the amount of storage shared. Thus, users who have plenty of free space on their hard drives and a fast internet connection can reap the most benefits from the new incentives program.</p>
<p>Rewards are paid out in the form of BZZ tokens. The amount of tokens received is determined by the price of renting storage, which is fixed now, but will be calculated in a few weeks by a decentralised oracle according to supply and demand forces.</p>
<p>Staking has also been introduced to enable participation in the redistribution mechanism, which resembles Ethereum's proof of stake system, choosing storage providers for rewards distribution depending on their staking proportions</p>
<p>Set up a Node and Start EarningTo become a node operator, a standard computer with 20 GB of storage and a stable internet connection is required. The Swarm network is already operational and the team expects the incentives mechanism to help the Swarm economy expand, with the network becoming fully self-sustaining while enforcing a healthy balance between storage operators and users. Swarm is also working on a new type of computer, called a Web3PC, which is private by design and respectful of users' rights to use and produce content. The team plans to have a working Web3PC prototype available by June 2023.</p>
<p>This computer will communicate, store, and provide services without leaking any private information, and all data will belong to its rightful owners. Fairdrive, a Dropbox-like solution for file storage in Swarm, is already available and allows users to easily use the Swarm network in a familiar Web 2.0 fashion. Swarm is on a transformative journey, contributing to the development of the web3 space by letting people regain sovereignty over their own data. In turn, this will allow for the freeflow of information without censorship or data tracking. Users will be able to keep their data private or, in turn, get paid for sharing it with marketers and companies of their choosing.</p>
<p>About Swarm</p>
<p>Swarm is a decentralised data storage and distribution technology. It's a base layer infrastructure for Web3 on which developers can create, host, and store dApps and all their accompanying data, NFT meta-data, and media files. It's an open-source, p2p network that respects the privacy of its users' data and secures it by default.</p>
<p>The Swarm protocol shares similarities with P2P (peer-to-peer) storage networks like BitTorrent but the main difference with other decentralized storage solutions stands out with its integrated economic incentives, which enable permissionless upload and censorship-resistant data architecture.</p>
<p>A structural difference is the data upload solution. With other popular storage solutions, that contract is made directly with the storer, knowing the data stored, making them suitable for private data only. In Swarm, due to its architecture, such a deal is made with the whole network, delivering the permissionless property and making it suitable for both private and public data.</p>
<p>Swarm aims to serve as the serverless internet operating system for hosting and running dApps (decentralised applications).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Paxful peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace will no longer feature Ethereum&rsquo;s native token ETH. Paxful CEO says it is digital fiat.</p>
<p>CEO Ray Youssef, of the Paxful peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace, tweeted that his company had decided to remove ETH, saying that there were a number of concerns surrounding the PoW cryptocurrency.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We finally kicked #ethereum off our marketplace. 11.6m humans safer. Integrity over revenue. Who is next ? pic.twitter.com/JTJXa5RYJ8</p>
&mdash; Ray Youssef (@raypaxful) December 21, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>Youssef explained that even though there may be a lot of revenue from ETH, it lacked &ldquo;integrity&rdquo;. He said in his personally written tweet:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The biggest problem in the world is economic apartheid. It is the root of all of humanity&rsquo;s pain. I want to see a world where Bitcoin frees billions of people held back by this evil system, especially those unnecessarily harmed living in the Global South. This is why I built Paxful - to achieve this MISSION. It is what truly drives me, it&rsquo;s from the heart, and this is personal to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Paxful CEO cited 3 major concerns he had with Ethereum, and the first was that the network had switched to Proof-of-Stake from Proof-of-Work. He said that PoW kept Bitcoin honest, but PoS had made ETH just a digital form of fiat.</p>
<p>He said that ETH was no longer decentralised, was controlled by a small group of people, and that one day permission would be needed in order to use it.</p>
<p>Finally, he gave his view that ETH had allowed &ldquo;scams that have robbed billions of people&rdquo;, and that it had taken momentum away from Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He finished by saying that the crypto industry was under attack and that his company had the responsibility to protect its users. He said that they weren&rsquo;t perfect but would always try to do the right thing. His hope was that in the end, all the money lost through scammers would appear as pennies against all the benefits of Bitcoin for humanity in the long run.</p>
